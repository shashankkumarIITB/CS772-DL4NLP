42,Helps nails dry much faster...the only reason I didn't give it full stars is it is a little messy the greasy stuff gets everywhere.,4
43,"Package came on time.  Instructiions are good, and the product performs as advertised.  A dental hygienist recommended the Water Pik.",5
44,Reminds me of Vaseline. I don't see what it's doing to help anything.,3
45,The  holding latch cover on and off volume control.  It slips off constantly. i would not recommend. They didn't consider compotent t design,2

56,"Not certain yet if it is really helping, but certainly not hurting me.",5
57,Replaced a similar Waterpik that I had for many years.  My advice is that eveyone should add this to their tools to make your teeth clean.,4
58,I have been using this powder for some years and still love it especially in this climate.  Barbados,5
59,"Don't buy from this Product, false price advertisement and cheap crap!!",1
60,This product was OK. Application is easy. It doesn't last very long for warm days. It would look cakey on some areas.,3

73,The end doesn't stay in place allowing the plastic bristles to slide out.,3

76,"Worked great, I'll buy it again for sure.",5
77,"after receiving the item damaged, the company was able to replace the part, so far it appears to work well",3
78,waiting on the plastic so they can work their magic together,4

89,I was happy with the product until recently but it doesn't charge any more after less than 1 year of occasional use...,1
90,Son came back from Costa Rica without a sunburn so it must have worked,4
91,After swimming it helped after I took a shower and put lotion on and no itching like I had before.,4
92,My husband uses it with a waist band to exercise and it makes that area sweat buckets. Very good and useful.,5

94,"Good, but not quite like I remember from mid 1960's.",4
95,I bought this for my dive mask and it works well,4
96,make sure you have the proper razor for this product  you need one with a reservoir  it was not disclosed on advertisment and now i own this stuff,1
97,I wish the fabric was nicer - it's kind of slippery and cheap.,3
98,"Very pretty and durable, but it does look like fake gold because it is a little to gold.",4
99,This razor makes my husband face smooth and fabulous. Easy to use and small in sace.,5
100,"I think it works, but takes about more than two days",4
101,This product did not have a safety seal nor did it come in a Dermalogica box.  All of this makes me questions it's authenticity.,2
102,I have tryed every base possable and for the price can't be beat! I would recommend to everyone and is so lite and even coverage!,5
103,Came broken and the nail glue was spilling  did not work and both back eating where blended :(,1
104,I am so disappointed was looking for a facial system but this is not for me  better luck with something else,1
105,Love the color and the moisture it gives my lips.  I reapply after lunch and that is it.  Gets me through the work day otherwise!,5
106,The caps came broken. This is the second time I ordered these just because I like the size and I can't find any other brand.,2
107,I use a wheelchair and the back of my legs get sore. This really helps keep them moisturized so they don't hurt,5

113,My wife loves this product and it seems to be mellowing her eczema very nicely.  One of the very few products she's had success with!,4
114,"Don't provide the same amout of good shaves, but the quanitiy buy makes up for it.",3
115,"Shaves well for about 1.5 years, it is not as good as it used to be even when I've bought and replaced the shaving heads.",4
116,Not as expected. Package states it is for holding compression legwear in place. I use it to keep thigh highs in place.,2
117,Not quite as close a shave as I hoped but performs well to the described specifications.,3
118,Love it. Wish it came with a smaller brush for my 3 year old but I can order it so there is a quick fix.,4
119,"Youch, these things cut like no other razor I've ever used! Will never buy again.",1
120,I was looking for a spray on toner that would promote normal facial acidity with no harmful ingredients.  This is perfect!,4
121,Fragrant but more old fashioned rose than anything else. seemed a bit strong too,3
122,The fit is good and it definitely protects your hands. I am pleased to have found these.......,5
123,"I purchased the lavender spray made by this same company and I liked it.
However, I did not like the scent of this spray.",1
124,"Local drugstores don't stock it. Only their own brands. Hateful. But from big A,
Good old Johnson's!",5
125,Only bad thing is it makes your cuticles orange so you have to wash it off,4
126,"Good product, but the label of the bottle wouldn't stay.",4
127,"It only worked for one year. It stoped pumping water after a year. For the price, I expect it can last longer. Disappointed.",2
128,"It is a lightweight tool, which great water pressure to clean out even the most stubborn piece of food. It works quite well to remove plaque!",4
129,"Worked great initially, but broke after two months. Will be buying a better version!",1
130,Exactly what I thought it was. Easyto use and looks exactly like the picture.  The only issue is that it is not really a rounded bottom.,4
131,I have been wearing this fragrance for years and the body cream luxurios. In fact I wear it alone for a longer lasting and subtle effect.,5
132,"If you have a Braun Electric Razor with Cleaning Station, these are a must to keep it clean and fully charged with no trouble.",5
133,"Great idea, smaller than I thought but it got the job done.",4
134,"Great light and the correct bulb for my vanity mirror; however, they get super hot!",3

139,"Tea tree oil works great for itchy bites, but warning: the smell is SUPER strong!",4
140,"I use it for my tanning bed. Does what it suppose to do. But feels a little sharp.
It works.",4
141,Fast shipping.  Product smells fantastic but not any better than $2.00 shaving cream.,2
142,"as a matter of fact, it so pleased me that I ordered another copy for my daughter, who is just starting to learn to preserve foods.",5
143,Using for the last few weeks; not noticing any improvement yet. Will continue using the product.,4
144,The oil actually kind of dries my skin out as it dries.  I purchased a different brand that does not do that.,2
145,"They're hard, uncomfortable, they fall out, and they don't push anything up. Save your money.",1
146,The sides are so sharp it actually scratch her ear to the point of bleeding,1
147,great buy! better than buying  a new shaver!!,5

151,very flimsy. not as long as the pic. but it looks pretty good,3

153,Ok....liked the fuzzy peach much better....don't they make that anymore ?,2
154,"I love everything except the wax that came with it. The creme wax only manages to pull off baby hairs. Anything thicker, it leaves behind.",4
155,Good - works. You can buy other brans that work too that aren't as expensive,4
156,"These are a fairly sharp blade, but do not last more than 1 or 2 shaves with my beard.  Good value and good beginner blade.",4
157,I've been using it religiously but it seems to have gotten very chalky and takes ages to absorb into my skin.,2
158,Small compact board.  Nice colors to choose from and easy to store.,4
159,I am new to safety razors and still trying blades. These work . What more can I say. Sure beats plastic throw-away shavers.,4
160,Definately a blend with other florals. Trace of spice. Did not like.,2
161,"wrong product, didn't work.  could not have been a worse experience, sadly.",1
162,Works well but can irritate your skin if in constant contact with your skin over time. But it does work well on your hair.,5

Good product at a good price.",4

180,It has no smell to it.  Not like I got in the store.,1
181,I love this color so much. These blushes an bronzers are my fave. I have really sensitive skin and they never ever break me out.,5

183,"This works well and smells good, and this was a great price for a six-pack.",4
184,"Very pretty, large opening to fit paper rolls, good size, worth the cost.",4
185,"Some came broken, but honestly I wasn't expecting much.",3
186,This my 4rd trimmer in 15 years and by far the best yet. Love the vacumn collection space as the mess leaves very little cleanup.,5
187,Used product for about one month (occasionally) and it quit working.  Would not buy again.  Looks nice but that is all.,1

193,This is a great Argan oil. It's been wonderful for my skin with the harsh winter conditions we have in the Northeast.,4

Still happy with product, chose not to return.",3
199,"Even used at the lowest power level, it made my gums bleed. It also was very messy.",2
200,These are really inexpensive but much harder to use. They easily slide off your teeth. I'd recommend the advance seal version instead.,3
201,So what did you find that worked well????,3
202,"Product is good, however, the teeth are a bit too long to effectively grab shorter hair.",4
203,After 2.5 years (not daily use) the button is sticking--the one you use for the flow of the water.,3
204,This stuff worked for a while but then my two Daughters began to acquire a taste for it and they didn't mind the bitterness.,4

211,I am very pleased with this unit.  A great improvement over previous available units.,4
212,I like that there are three different sizes and they're made well. I just wish the smallest wasn't quite so small.,4
213,I bought this for my daughter who after three weeks of use does not see any difference whatsoever.,3
214,Didn't quite get the relief I was hoping to have,3
215,These look a little cheap. I'm not using them on my nails anymore because there are prettier gems out there.,3
216,I love this soap. Simple as that. Great product and fast delivery.,5
217,Does the job but is a little messy because it's hard to keep the pic in your mouth the whole time.,3
218,"It's a rich, thick formula that is great for dry skin",4
219,Not durable.  It's be gas falling apart n had to throw it away 2nd week.  Don't waste your money on this cheap garbage.,1
220,Came broken. I should have taken into consideration the review stating that fact. Imagine being super happy then super disappointed in the same minute!,1
221,I really like my gun. Run 2 tattoos it is smooth will order another one,4
222,"nothing fancy, simple and sleek shave soap bowl that gets the job done",4
223,"Awesome quality, looks very presentable having it on the counter with my matching silver razor..the price is amazing for what it is!",5
224,I felt misled.  It said 4head headbands - plural.  I was expecting four in quantity and only received one.  They should make the heading singular.,2
225,"The service was great, but I returned this grooming system unopened because I decided to purchase a more expensive clipper with a set of separate combs.",3
226,"I received a 3oz container, not 5oz as advertised. It is clearly the old packaging, not the new design that is shown in the image.",1

228,"I need a smaller barrel, but couldn't find one.  Otherwise it was o.k.",4
229,"Moisture doesn't really last. I like to use Avocado butter, moisture lasts for a long time and more creamier.",3
230,Came in a timely manner and works perfectly.  It was much cheaper than other places that  l checked,4
231,"The product have a down quality and it come in a big box unnecessarily, cause it's too short, and I loose money with the courier.",1
232,Great product and received it very quickly since I ama Prime member,5

235,"Product does not come out smoothly, it splatters and drops get everywhere.  Otherwise, I would have loved it.",3
236,Color is not the same as the photo. I realize my computer monitor may have caused that.,3
237,this is the best blush by far. a must have.,5
238,i had to dig my old blades and screen out of the garbage...these blades wouldn't shave the fuzz off a peach...fail,1
239,These are great toothpicks but can be a choking hazard for young children.,4
240,Nice case for the price.  No complaints  Hope it lasts.,5
241,"Very nice, looks great by my foot bridge. Connecting wire is just a bit too short, another 3-4 inches would work",4
242,I have a fairly thick hair.  These were ok. Nothing special.  A Mach 3 would have been much better.,3
243,This is an awesome stocking cap for compression when heavy or mildly wolfing during a wolf! I definitely will recommend this product!,5
244,ME ENCANTO FUE UN BUEN REGALO PARA EL CUMPLE DE MI HERMANA Y TAMBIEN LE GUSTO MUCHO RECOMIENDO ESTE VENDEDODR MUY PUNTUAL Y ME GUSTO MUCHO EL PRODUCTO,4
245,Love this product....works well if you hate flossing the regular way:-),5
246,Huge improvement has been made to this appliance.  Many options and adjustable spray are welcomed additions for us.,4
247,"this product did not do anything except block pores ,it is not a treatment or a primer,",1
248,"nice , but broke on day 2... too soft...",4
249,"I like the smaller brush, but find the dryer quite heavy and bulky.",3
250,The teeth are too long for short hair.  It wouldn't work on my hair.,2
251,This product doesn't meet the need very well but is somewhat helpful.,3
252,"I thought I was getting a long cape, it was just and oversized bib. But you get what you pay for.",1
253,Owned this for 3 or 4 weeks so far. No complaints.,4
254,This is a decent hand and body lotion that moisturises and absorbs fairly quickly.  The scent is recognisably lavender but a bit unnatural though not unpleasant.,3
255,It was a lot smaller than expected. But i am still pleased,4
256,I felt totally refreshed and and the scent was wonderful after using this soap.,4
257,Very happy with this curling iron. Perfect size wand for med short hair!!,4
258,"Arrived sooner than expected and they sparkle very nicely, my only complain is that they are a bit large for my tragus.",4
259,Died after less than 2 months of use. Don't waste your money.,1
260,Not as soft as you'd think. Also I thought it would be 4 different colors in the box.,3
261,"It is too pasty, I bought it thinking it was one of those lip stain products out there but I was wrong.",1
262,"Does it's job, holds my razor and brush well...Chrome finish is nice and looks classy in the bathroom.",4
263,All OF MY BRUSH HEADS CAME OFF VERY POOR QUALITY!!! wish I could get my money BACK OR SOME NEW BRUSHES!!!!,1
264,Seem to work.. results weren't as dramatic as I expected but will use in future,4
265,These stamping polishes are far too translucent and not pigmented enough to cut it. I was very disappointed.,1
266,Didn't have 20 sent to me and I've already had three fall apart. I guess you get what you pay for.,2
267,2 years later it's still working for my son. Good product.,4
268,"I love this lotion, but I get it at Walmart for half the price ($3.67).",4
269,"After several weeks of consistent, daily use, there are no changes. I'm disappointed with this product to say the least.",1

272,"Best makeup brush cleaner I have ever used!  No clue what's in it, but my flat kabuki has never been cleaner!",5
273,I would start with using this cream once a day. it does an excellent job drying out acne but that means dry skin and flaky make up,3
274,Only been using about 3 weeks so far product works as described. Be sure to read instructions carefully.,4
275,"Not as pictured. I wanted tubes with a rounded top like it shows, they are ridged.",1
276,Had a hard time pushing it through the hole. I wound up giving them away.,2
277,I actually expected an oil instead of a pomade. It was actually hard pomade too... No fancy from my part... Makes hair fill heavy..,3
278,YUCKY! Super gross flavor. Too much salt. Donated it to a shelter.,1
279,I've been using every night for almost 2 weeks and see minimal lightening if any.....don't know if I would purchase again.,1
280,The hat was not like the picture it is much smaller. The hat is like a fitted cap. Nothing like I ordered. Very disappointed.,1
281,"Works well, although haven't had much use for most of the attachments.",4
282,Doesn't seem like the actual product from Victoria's Secret. ,1
283,Didn't fit. It was confusing. I didn't like it,1
284,"It didn't last very long the cord leaked at the handle connector and broke off....No way to repair it, less then 2 years old...",1
285,"It will stain your pillow really bad!  Even after a whole day using it, it got my pillow case painted!",1
286,"Good Shaver, takes a little getting used to. May get a little irritation first week or so, after that fine.",5
287,It works as good or better than the expensive tanning lotions sold at my tanning salon. Need a great tan use this stuff.,5
288,"These fell apart so easily, I would not recommend this product. I'm not satisfied with my order and will not be ordering again.",1
289,"very harsh on my skin. I love their cleanser, but this toner is way too harsh and abrasive on my skin.",1
290,Does not fit my dryer!!!! Seems well made but definitely NOT universal!,1
291,"Gross, don't buy.  Smells cheap and just plain awful!",1
292,"Crap. For really smaller nips and it doesn't stick. Unfortunate too, since it's all hand-stitched.",1
293,This ddnt work for me. Used morning and night as a moisturizer but no change. Glad it made a difference to some. Not on me.,1
294,"Its a very good color on my fair skin. However, at 29, the slight sparkle seems a bit much.",4
295,this is a very great spray to reduce bruising and spells good for aroematherapy.  works great but expensive for the amount you get.,4
296,"It broke the first time I used it. The brush came right off, the plastic was stripped where it attached to the handle.",1
297,The wig is adjustable but came in just an envelope so it was all smashed and has to be brought back to life.,3
298,Horrible...this stuff has hyaluronic acid in it. It makes my face break out.,1
299,These work well but are somewhat wasteful - better to just get a pot of wax and cloth strips and DIY,4
300,I like this thing and the pressure seems pretty good. My only complaint is that the picks break easily if dropped.,4
301,"I bought one a few days ago, it arrived yesterday. I tried this morning, it works very well. a good product.",4
302,"The skin looks greasy and leaves oily spots, so basically I cannot touch anything after applying this ointment. Don't recommend it at all :(",2
303,This mask is very comfortable and relaxing. Its perfect for a spa day at home when you just want to kick back and forget about your worries.,4
304,the connector ends where too stiff and I had difficulty attaching and releasing devices.  Not much more to say... did not work for my application.,2
305,I charged it up once and a month later its still going strong. Its not great but worth the price,4
306,Color matched really well. Stayed on even after brushing.  washed right out no residue. nice dispenser pin point onto the gray,4
307,Ink pen that came with the labels does not write on them.,3
308,Great compression when double folded..great product and quality..but boo boo...? Haha,4
309,have used this before. they do the job. works great for people with sensitive skin too. found it to be safe.,4
310,"Not sure how to use it as there are no instructions, was expecting a much easier to use product and have not successfully used this one time yet",2
311,"We've been using for a few months and it still annoys me. If you don't like sweat/deodorant stains, don't buy this product.",3
312,"Really nice lipstick, sort of a dark red if you layer it on. Compliments my skin well.",4
313,Ok but wish it would heat up more. Will do until I find a better one,3
314,"After a while,  the round handle piece breaks and the numbers completely rub off easily.",3
315,Works okay but can be hotter to help set the curl better.  It does get tangled in the hair and the button does not work,4
316,"its a little sticky, and not the color i ordered.",3
317,It does the job. I use this for nail art and it works great to keep my nails protected from unwanted nail polish.,4
318,"Though I was not a big fan of the flavor, my younger brother loves it. Super easy to clean.",4
319,the razor that I ordered is what  i got and seems to work good.  I would recomend this razor to others,4
320,Got a really bad body rash all over that required a dermatologist. It smells nice tho. Sorry I can't recommend it.,1
321,Total waste of money!  I can't imagine there is anyway to use this stuff and not get it in your eyeballs.  Painful!,1
322,"Great colors, all very organized. Perfect for my needs. Makes all my nail art extra fun to do by adding extra sparkle.",5
323,seem to keep the light out while doing a facial but still need to put cotton pads underneath.,3
324,Love the smell and makes my daughter's hair very soft.,4
325,Does exactly what it needs to do and isn't hard to clean. Has protected my brush very well.,5
326,This product didn't last a full month as expected because the stickiness wore off.,1
327,Its very nice but clips are too short and slips off sweaters easily. It is hard to hold on clip to open and slip on sweater,3
328,cant stand up to daily use. very hard to get replacement tips. too expensive for an item that isn't made to last.,4
329,This item is over priced! I bought one just like it for $9.00. 4 stars for the product,4
330,"Great stuff, thanks Plant Therapy, for living up to my expectations.",5
331,Love it!  for a small unit really scents my whole house,5
332,"Horrible, cloying perfume. Reeks of cheapness. Overwhelming floral stench. Save up and buy something decent, FFS.",1
333,This is my second one- the first broke after about 5 years. It does the job for a reasonable price.,4
334,"It is Ok blade. It will give me decent shave.
Not impressed though. Persona or Astra works much for me better.",3
335,Very very disappointed!!! Sealed was broken on product and I thought it was clear but thats ok just not happy with damage product,1
336,Still unable to find shaver that my b/f can use on his face that will last over 2 weeks!,3
337,As great as the one for baby use. Can sooth chapped skin quickly and well.,5
338,"rub a small amount into palm.
spread it around
cost effective
it lasts a long time.
it is hard to detect that you are using.",4
339,Exactly as pictured but came kimda squished and folded weird. I just ironed them back to normal. Super cute!,4
340,"its ok. the same quality as the one that came with the flosser, however, i didn't get to this and my airfloss broke.",3
341,"Color is white not ivory or off white. It's functional and good to heal my dry hands.
Easy to wash.",4
342,Brushes are great. Just wished it labeld what each one is used for you.,3
343,Cheaply made junk...  Daughter only had it for a couple days before it broke,1
344,I cannot get enough of this stuff. Makes my hair so shiny!,5
345,"Product delivered was not same as picture.  Received Cinema Secrets brand of liquid latex, not the Mehron brand.  Disappointed.",1
346,"Very thin material.  Made for adults.  not children, the neck was too large",4
347,"The ""push up"" tube is hard to use because it doesnt stay up.",3
348,"Shaver works very well, but the trimmer is too small for what I use it for.",4
349,"Came quicker than estimated..which was a nice surprise. It is cute, you know...it is your average everyday little necklace :-)",4
350,Nice little unit. Don't need all the extra attachments but am sure that other users would find them useful. Priced right.,4
351,"Overpriced, overhyped, over everything, silly name.
Ugly color, almost tangerine. Yuck!",2
352,"After using this product continously for 14 days, I did not see any difference in color of my teeth. $25 down the drain.",2
353,Exactly what was needed and at a fair price. I could not find this exact bulb anywhere locally,5
354,works well- but sounds much noisier than previous one. Sounds like it is will die any day.,4
355,Smells wonderful and lathers great. My favorite brand for my boys. A little bummed that the bottle leaked in the shipping box.,4
356,I have been using this product for quite a while now. I really like it!,4
357,The best around.  Good for day to day use.,5
358,Standard brand item at a low price.  used the option to have periodic deliveries and saved even more.,4
359,"It smells weird. The ""cream"" looks more like cottage cheese.",2
360,Not creamy at all and very difficult to blend into skin.,2
361,A bit awkward in some ways but it works well and gets the teeth clean.,4
362,I'm a licensed esthetician. I've Used this kit for 6 months and it has worked out great! Everything was received in good order.,5
363,Very light and not oily ..so far im liking this product,4
364,Pendant was twisted and stone had fallen out. The chain had a broken clasp.,1
365,Love all the scents. Nice selection that lasts a long time,5
366,I can't find another pre-electric that can compare. Also the price is right.,4
367,Fast shipment. But I've been using now for almost 4 weeks and absolutely NO difference in my dark spots. Very disappointing. =(,2
368,"Hard set, will keep but would not buy another one.",1
369,The soap is good. Im surprised by its aroma and quality but the 3.00 shipping kind of steers me away from the product.,3
370,i was very pleased with the product.. works very well on any part of the body. especially on its titled location.. very smooth.,5
371,"They're cute; smaller than I thought, and kind of come off looking like horns sometimes.",4
372,I am not happy with the flavor these sticks possess.  They do not seem natural.,3
373,It is much smaller than anticipated with no additional pockets. It does not hold nearly the amount of books I had hoped it would.,2
374,I read the reviews and was excited to try this. Very big disappointment. Lid cracked after arrival and did nothing as I thought it should.,2
375,"Nice, portable, does not feel or lather as well as my other brushes...will still be looking for another traveling alternative.",3
376,Bought this about 4 months ago and stopped working. Don't buy this. Waste of money.,1
377,didnt work the moment it was taken out of the package & took months to deliver!,1
378,"Burn face, but I use it to wash my hair.",1
379,you have to wear it for an hour and well it doesnt really work so great anyway,3
380,"I really love the color, but I hate that I have to keep reapplying it.",4
381,i didn't like it i used it on my face and for oily people don't use it is very greasy.,1
382,cheap pieces with sharp edges... but they were cheap.,3
383,Not as sharp as I hoped left a case of razor burn for me,3
384,This item is not at all as described. It isn't sharp enough to allow a person to cut anything!,1
385,Clasp broke and lost bracelet in less than 3 hours.,1
386,"Not so sure I like this soap, it has been giving me a very fishy smell.",1
387,did not need them but couldn't send them back so I am stuck with them...,3
388,They are brushes for nails what I received. I think it's a fake,2
389,"Like everything, when I was younger everything was bigger. Aside from that I'm good. I had two fillings and this helped with the pain.",4
390,I expected an iron that blew hot air.  There was not an adequate description.  It takes a long time for it to heat up.,3
391,Gets rid of dandruff...but the product by itself is really bad for hair.,2
392,I lost a lot of the foundation from packaging. Has a weird smell to it. Like the pick bottle much better.,2
393,Followed directions carefully. It did not do the job at all.,1
394,after wet shaving it feels good to finish with alumn. added to my routine. I like it. very convenient to apply in this curved format.,4
395,The water goes into the battery pack. Cannot use in the shower :(...it's useless,1
396,I am not so happy with it. It highlights my dark circles under eye. It works well on rest of the face.,3
397,finally got around to BL2. so far not too bad,4
398,I tried these gloves in the shower and while they worked well with my body scrub they had a few snags but they did the job.,4
399,"Very nice stand!  Sturdy, classic styling, and doesn't take up the whole counter. Very good value.",5
400,Its good and reached less than the given time. It works well on the oily skin when combined with shaving gel.,3
401,These were supposed to include a transparent bra.  There was no bra.,2
402,"received on time the norelco bg2030 but the shaving head was damaged, called norelco and they did mail new one for free",1
403,Love these products and will buy more in the future when I run out.  Perfect eye sparkle for brightening eye color.,5
404,Great price but doesn't protect all day long.  In addition I paid more for shipping that for the actual deodorant.,4
405,The soaps are great and make a good gift.  However the box arrived opened (broken seal) and damaged.  That was disappointing.,4
406,"As other reviews have said, the 99 cent mesh puff scrubbers work much better than this item.",2
407,Very pretty necklace - it has a nice weight to it as well. Perfect for dressing up a plain top in any season!,5
408,"Came in great condition, however in a darker green than the light green pictured here. I am happy overall with purchase.",4
409,Scrub is coming off from the holder within a week of use. Its not good for regular and long use.,2
410,Love Mitchum but only the gel. The solid crumbles and breaks during application. RECOMMEND gel only!,1
411,This towel works so well. I just add some liquid bath soap and I feel super clean and soft! Great for reaching your entire back.,5
412,i thought they were somewhat bigger. but still like them,4
413,"Dont waste your money,the plastic backing are so fragile.",1
414,I used this product once and it stopped working. Tried several different brand new batteries and it wouldnt turn on.,1
415,My daughter suffered a skin reaction when using it.  We stopped uing it immediately.  She complained about itching after applying it.,1
416,"It's hard to say- the containers were not sealed, and there was product dried all over the outside of the packaging, but not much inside.",1
417,"has a strong scent, does help raise hairs so shaving is easier.",4
418,Not a bad seller but ICK on the product.  I want taste & a some heat/tingling.,2
419,Great for the price! The rubber grips are useless keep falling off but I don't like/need them anyway,4
420,This mouth wash is perfect to use and cleans with a fresh Colgate feeling that provides a whitening effect on teeth.,5
421,I grew up with a waterpik.  Had not used one in many years.  It is a good tool for cleaning your teeth and gums.,4
422,If you have fine short bear the vacuum maybe does something but with my beard it is completely useless buy the one without the vacuum.,4
423,This was a gift and they didn't have anything bad to say about the product.,4
424,"Still got a whole box of these!!
They just multiply!!!",4
425,"It doesn't look like there's 3000 of these gems in this container. They are very frustrating to use, even with slanted tweezers.",3
426,"Absolute best hair product line for kids. My daughters hair is shiny, soft and always 100% tangle free!!",5
427,Great way to use essential oils especially those for respiratory issues.,4
428,this product was recommended to me by a friend - but it did not work as well as I had hoped,1
429,Smallest bottle of product I've ever seen.  Not worth the money,2
430,They are so much better than other temporary tattoo's I've purchased. The quality is amazing. Does not wash off in the shower.,5
431,"works great, but its a little flimsy and lasted a 6 months. So i would by 2 per year.or maybe the one I received was a lemon",4
432,need a fine point sharpie to write on these.  difficult to get them off the page,3
433,Works beautifully for me!  Definitely a permanent part of my daily regime!  Thank you OzNaturals!,5
434,Seems to work as it is said in the other reviews!!! Helped a lot with my gums and kept my breath fresh. Great product!,4
435,"that was i expecting for!, it's ok, I recommend it the brand good product, good service, every think is Ok",4
436,Might as well just put vasoline on my dry skin. Thought this was a non petroleum product.,1
437,I use this every night as my evening moisturizer. I love it.,4
438,Love this cuticle oil it smells and works great! It made my cuticles super soft and the surrounding skin really fragrant.,4
439,My husband loves it!  Great shave and easy to clean too.,5
440,I do not like this scarf due to it being short. Being short means I can not wear it like I want to.,1
441,It was nothing like the picture. And the ends were curled so it was hard to do anything with it.,1
442,for someone who has dental problems this works wonders.  Used several times a day is best.  This is especially good with braces.,4
443,"Don't really use it that often, when I do it does seem to slim jaw,",4
444,I like this product.  It does cover up the gray really well.  It is easy to use,4
445,I've used the oil a couple times & am pleased thus far.,4
446,we baught this for a friend and she is Very Pleased it was recived in about a week,4
447,The product works great. It is used to clean around braces and the gum line. It is used once a day.,5
448,Met expectations and is identical to my old one.  Wish Caruso would add an on/off switch.,4
449,product as shown in picture. delivery time takes too long,3
450,"Good one, I like it, I am using it since one year no issues yet, I can recommend it ...",4
451,I'm glad that I found somewhere to get these replaceable blades at a good price. Thanks again,5
452,"Just what I've been looking for, a sticker like the pro's use.  Now, there's no excuse for a late oil change.",5
453,"Wonderful scent.  I just love Zum bar soaps, but cant get this particular scent locally.",5
454,This stuff does not work. It's impossible to keep it on your gums. Don't waste your money ... go to the dentist instead.,1
455,Very  nice and the fragrance is not overwhelming.  Great for my my granddaughter's hair.,5
456,drying my face and body...Guess will use it as HAND SOAP... Bad experience,1
457,Didn't notice a difference in removing the chlorine smell. I have a very sensative nose. A regular lotion I think does the same thing.,2
458,Battery life after a year is not great.  I can use it 2-3 minutes before it starts to slow down due to battery lag.,2
459,"It doesn't fully fit my head but is still cute.  Definitely would buy it again , great price also :)",4
460,I cannot make an assessment without using them first. I would expect them to be as good as my current one.,5
461,my son sock his fingers even I put Mavala solution on his fingers,1
462,"a first class P.O.S. !
dont waste your money.
if you are looking for a
gag gift , that would be at best",1
463,As advertised.  Just a little problem keeping the elastic band tied to the item.,4
464,Too soft. They don't really do anything. I just ended up throwing them away. I'd say not worth it. Sorry.,1
465,"this product is not easy to apply, streaky, and generally a horrible lipstick.  Save your money for a moisturizing lipstick, this one is dry.",1
466,Used at the gumline where my enamel has worn away and it made my teeth throb!!,1
467,Seller will not stop spamming me for a 5 star review. The product is fine.,1
468,need to use it for a month or so to see the results,4
469,very drying. flaky. beautiful color though. just don't like application.,2
470,"Tasted earthy, however did a santadtic job of alleviating my illness.",4
471,"This is terrible , it leaves streaky marks on your face it does not blend well at all ...very disappointed.",1
472,not as nice of quality as i expected kind of cheap looking and feeling brushes. some brushes were uneven and fake feeling,2
473,doesn't work. Runs yes but doesn't do anything. Still have to resort to q-tip. No actual instruction with it either.,2
474,I love my flosser!  And all the attachments are awesome!  It's been over a year since my purchase and I still use it.,5
475,It works great. The cream wax is a little hard to get to work though.,3
476,I like the way these goggles feel. Easy to clean and works as expected.,5
477,Does not lather at all.  I will go back to Dial.  It does smell good though.,1
478,It's a great product for me will reorder when out,5
479,DOESN'T WORK EVEN ON FINE HAIR. NICE SMELL BUT OILY.,2
480,Too strong. I added a few drops to an aromatherapy mister and it was overpowering! Would not recommend.,1
481,Good product. Unfortunately I woke up with red marks one day after using this pad and had to massage my skin to get back to normal.,2
482,"I have always been a Norelco fan, but they are letting their quality standards slip.",2
483,Color does hold for 6 weeks.  No stains or discoloration on the skin.  I have been using this product for the past 3 years.,4
484,"This solution does work well in the Norelco razor cleaning system.
It lets the shaving head run smoothly.
It is pricy though.",4
485,Smaller than picture seems. Blade is not sharp. Useless.,1
486,Get  three shaves per edge. Six shaves per blade.  Great savings over throw away razors.,4
487,it is exactly  what iwas looking for at a very reasonable price - brush and razor fit perfecly,5
488,"absolutely hate this , feels like I have glue on my lips . very disappointed .",1
489,The colors are amazing. I love the case. I just wish they are in different shapes. I would refer this to a friend,4
490,I have used glide for years and will continue to do so.,4
491,"completely not what I expected, doesn't even fit my boobs.",1
492,I only use this to clean my beauty blender but it works wonderfully!,5
493,Works very well.....makes my mouth and gums feel clean...recommended by my dentist .I recommend to anyway one who has gingivitis and gum problems,4
494,"Exactly what I needed for cutting my own hair
And it is easy to use and easy to clean after cuts",4
495,"Save your money and use a trash bag, it will be better quality",1
496,"Wrong color, too dark for me. It also lower my hair quality.",1
497,Turns Black.......none of the urban spa products are good. Other brushes also turned Black from barely any use.,1
498,I bought this for my son. He says it worked fine.,3
499,"Purchased the Waterpik for my daughter who has braces. Works great, much easier for her to clean teeth.",4
500,"Excellent seller, terrible product. All broke within 0-1 uses. The seller was great to work with me though.",1
501,"I placed few drops on the neck and my wrist and checked it out, nothing happened, and just like always. nothing.",1
502,Does very well in shaping to the contour of your body - big improvement from previous trimmers from norelco,4
503,Not too keen on this particular fragrance but the soap is what i expected.  Good size and price.  it lasts long too.,3
504,It makes my scalp itch but gets me through between my hair appts.,3
505,I wore this bracelet to a costumed dinner party.  It spent nearly the entire night in my purse because the clasp broke in the first two hours.,2
506,Only giving it four stars because this is a gift and not sure of performance.,4
507,"I love these so much, I started buying them in bulk!",5
508,So far so good. It soaks into my skin and does not irritate.,4
509,Great product.  Leaves my mouth feeling clean and fresh!,5
510,She seems to go for this type of thing. Well packaged and just as described. Looks pretty cool to me as well.,4
511,Combs/brushes are a little too long.  Worked great until last week when the switch started acting up and then just plain quit.,3
512,Totally worth the money.  Doesn't look cheap at all.  Looks like something you would buy from s department store.,5
513,"Well, I haven't had to use them yet but glad to have 'em handy. Told I must use six more words.",4
514,Not terribly sharp and a bit slippery because there is no grip or texture on the handles.,3
515,"It is creamy, does not last too long on lips.  Wanted a lighter pink color.",4
516,The edgewax holds the edges down. The only down fall is it turns white after a while.,4
517,i like this product and needed the samples to take on vacation instead of bringing larger sizes,5
518,"Just what i wanted, will defenetly order again. just what i wanted it for to show of my ipod nice.",5
519,Doesn't make a change in your hair at all and it smells pretty bad. There are much better products out there,2
520,I gave it two weeks & it worked for me - will buy again!,5
521,"Hair doesn't sweat, dry out, or break from friction while sleeping.",4
522,It's OK for traveling.  Does not have strong stream.,3
523,I purchased this item for my husband and he could not be any happier.  It is easy to use and prefers it over the water piks.,5
524,I really like this soap.  I tend to get dry skin in the winter and this soap cleans my hands and leaves my skin feeling hydrated.,4
525,I did not notice the big change in performance I was kind of hoping for but at the same time there were no problems.,4
526,Works great for indoor tanning. Handy spray makes for a fast application.,4
527,"I fell in love with japanese onsen when I traveled there long time ago.
The smell of hibiki is really great and brings back my good memory.",4
528,"Best stuff i ever used to assist in shaving.  Really, really takes the sting out of shaving with an electric razor.",5
529,The charger I received does not work at all. I'MSOMADDDDDDDDDDDDD....,1
530,love the 2 pack!!! and super sticky I'm obsessed with how well it dries and how long this product lasts,5
531,Would have given 5 stars except the white bra was sewn with the right strap twisted.  Returning for new one.,4
532,Posts are plastic so impossible to secure to ear.  Terrible quality. Amazon should discontinue to sell. Nothing but junk jewelry.,1
533,I am yet to see results on this one but I am hopeful.,4
534,Look like it send from the  garbage ! very  bed quality !,1
535,"The product is almost about to expire.
It was manufactured in 2007 so I m little disappointed with the product.",1
536,Product was okay. However the packing of the product was poorly done. The bottle opened inside the box.,4
537,This pulls and causes ingrown hairs.  Absolutely would not recommend.,1
538,I received my item today!! I can't stop laughing because it is so small. Very small scalp protector.,4
539,Out in public when someone seen it hanging off of my collar.  Kinda embrassed,2
540,Was a little disappointed that the sizes of the gems weren't very different. Was hoping for larger.,3
541,No seal on bottle. Extremely runny. Like water. Seams tampered with.,1
542,"i was very disappointed, this was cheaply made and not nearly as nice as pictured.
would not recommend to others",1
543,Didnt even fit right and didn't stay in place. Elastic was weak. Needs to be a lil bigger and thicker.,1
544,I like the lightness of this cream. It nice to a light cover up that has SPF in it with a little color.,4
545,Replaced a similar Waterpik that I had for many years.  My advice is that eveyone should add this to their tools to make your teeth clean.,4
546,Would not purchase again. Did not smell like lavender. Terrible smell.,1

570,Velcro is somewhat lacking but a good clothes pin fills in just fine.,3

597,Caused me to break out in an itchy rash with blisters. Lasted for two weeks! Would never try again. Waste of money.,1

It is Lustray...
Cap already broke.

621,Each clipper has a bur right where you would cut so they are useless to use as they don't cut,2
622,Works great with safety razor and brush that were bought separately.  Stands without a problem.  Good so far...,4
623,Wow... Very easy to use compared to traditional flossing.  Leaves teeth as clean as the dentist office.  Should have bought earlier.,5
624,This batch was a little watery. But it will do,3
625,"Don't like the smell but that's my issue,  not the product.  Would buy is typy like the smell.",4

632,Works great and keeps my Braun shaver working/smelling like new.,4
633,Had to buy another one... the power was not good enough.,2
634,This toothbrush is fine for travel or convenience but don't expect it to be anything close to a Sonicair because it's not.,3
635,"Very, very messy to use.  Results were somewhat noticeable, but certainly not worth the effort.",3
636,Works like a charm to prevent chafing. Already ordered two more jars. It feels better than plain petroleum jelly.,5

638,"1 star only thing good was the nipple covers, the rest would tear easily",1

646,This shaving system is great for short bristle and for sensitive skin. Very good price and quality for that price. Men love it!,4
647,"I bought this a while ago.  I used it once, then I read the ingredients.  It contains lead.  I never used it again.",1
648,I'm sure it was good for my hair but I couldn't get past the scent.  I think it was pure Argan oil without any fillers?,2
649,Purchased this for my 5 year old Grand-daughters birthday.  She loves it!!,5
650,Great little set for the price.  Take off one point for the chemically smell of the case.,4

664,"I still haven't ran out and I bought these months ago. They smell nice and strong, so they cover up all kinds of smells.",5
665,My package arrived in a timely manner. The product was exactly what I expected. I bought mine to make homemade salve and the product worked perfectly.,4
666,You really can't go wrong with Wet N Wild or NYX. The quality is great and the price is right,4
667,The nasal clips will rub the inside of your nose raw!,1
668,Exactly what I wanted and expected. Except that the bottle being primed already kinda freaks me out.,4
669,These are some of the most flimsiest brushes I've ever seen! These will go to my 12 yr old daughter!,2
670,Too big to put In my nose bought 80 of these. Can't even wear them. Disappointed,2
671,Smell too strong. Many of ANDALOU products have heavy scents. Natural to me should not smell like a candle factory.,1
672,"Works exactly like it says it will.

From NZ (240v mains) so had to get a transformer and adapter, but no major issues.",4
673,Where is the ingredients listing on the label? Do not be deceived by the word natural...,1
674,I hated the fact two were missing from the pack when I recieved them,4

676,"Needed to replace the pair I had, but this pair is not as user friendly and definitely not as sharp! :(",1

678,"Even though I don't always take two a daily, I still am seeing some real growth and I've been using it for 4 months now.",5
679,"Very disappointing performance, needs more pressure to do an adequate job between teeth, and under bridges. My old model, same brand, is better.",1
680,"LIGHTER COLOR, TEXTURE AND MUCH MORE DRYING THAN NEUTROGENA.  MAY BE A CHEAP SUBSTITUTE.",2
681,"It gets rid of hard to get at junk in your mouth, it has a large resevior, it is a bit messy though",4
682,The only difference that I can find is the printing on the bottle is in Japanese. And the price is a whole lot cheaper.,5
683,"I get compliments on the fragrance; however, I can not say that the product is attracting the opposite sex.",3

696,The color is far less bold than advertised; but it's not bad.,3
697,Great product.  The only thing I don't like is that the air concentrator keeps falling out. But I like how my hair looks.,5

699,"Flimsy and hurts your ears, pinches them very bad.",1
700,"Helping to tame my daughters curly curly hair. I can tell it is noticeably shinier and less frizzy. It also smells great, like Blueberries!",5
701,Easy for older person to use. Does a decent job especially for the price. I would recommend this product to friends.,4
702,"Sorry, but I could not get past the smell.",1
703,I really have not used it long enough for the price I wil lnot get it again. At least at this time that is how I feel.,3

705,Haven't used it yet.  My mother has and she likes it,3
706,Only thing that shrinks my zits over night... Even the deeper ones,5

708,"Its' good moisturizer but the smell is not great, especially since it's on your face...",2
709,It was very pretty. The lock is a little flimsy but for the price it serves its purpose.,4
710,Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair Synchronized Recovery Complex 100 ml / 3.4 oz is a good one serum. It make me feel my face is softer.,3
711,nipple covers work fine but these tapes don't lift larger breasts.  They adhere fine but do nothing for real lift.,1
712,"Nice feel, keeps your mouth clean but without the harsh burn that you may get form other products like Listerine.",4
713,Pretty color but I found lipstick to be very dry.  I would not buy again,2
714,It was a gift for my granddaughter  so I'm not sure how it was. She did like it.,4
715,This gets caught and tugs and nicks my skin. I no longer use it because of it,2
716,The eye mask broke after 2 weeks of light use.  The strap came off completely. Poor construction.,1

718,"Overpriced, overhyped, over everything, silly name.
Ugly color, almost tangerine. Yuck!",2
719,Everything about this great except for the color. I ordered the med/light brown but it looks almost black.,3

724,I love it!  What more to say?  I was happy to find it available and at a reasonable enough price.,5
725,Haven't had it long enough to tell but other than that my mom seems to like it so its fairly good,3
726,"Beautiful color but ugly packaging. Since the lid is plastic, it breaks easily :/",2
727,"Pretty color, but incredibly diluted, I feel like you could mix a darker pink with conditioner and get twice as much.",3
728,"Much smaller than I thought it would be, had to return it.",3
729,Cool but if I leave the batteries in they die each time unless I take them out. Who has time for that?!,2
730,I feel as if I'll run out of blades in 5 years.,5
731,Love it. It works like a charm.  This product is highly recommended for anybody that is interested in it. Will buy again.,5
732,"My daughter saw this &loved it. Arrived earlier than expected & it was exactly as pictured,great buy for the price.",3
733,It's great but burns when it gets on my special purpose!,4
734,My headband came ripped up on the one side wish it wasn't damaged. I work out a lot and was looking forward to wearing it,1
735,This glue works.  It has 2-3 day hold.  I haven't tested the waterproof aspect yet.  This is easy cleanup/removal and easy install.,4
736,I use this as my travel bowl.  It works. Good look.,4
737,So sad. I hoped I found a shampoo bar that DOESNT leave a waxy mess!,1
738,Not exactly what I was expecting and took FOREVER to arrive. But the quality is nice and I love the necklace and wear it often.,4
739,.There's just something about these that don't work for me.  I get better results and less irritation with Derby.  YMMV,2
740,My favorite color.....and it smells so good....wonderful make-up for the price...goes on smooth and it does not take very much.,5
741,Very thin..... not fit for my altar. Not sure what to do with it,2
742,Did not meet expectations at all . Now what is pictured or described .,1
743,Seems to work better than other types I've tried so am pleased with it - probably would recommend it for others,4
744,My husband uses this product and has used it for many years. He likes this brand better than any other.,4
745,"I suppose this product does the trick, but the scent is so strong and unpleasant that I can't use it.",2
746,I found the blades too dull and didn't cut close to the skin. I don't look well-groomed at all.,2
747,I have had no other pick but am very satisfied with this one that my dentist insisted that I purchase.,4
748,"Once u buy the product, you can see that the package says to wait 3 months to see results. Who has patience gif that...",1
749,Love it.  Couldn't find one like it in town anywhere so I bought this one on line.  It is perfect for long hair.,5
750,The mint flavor is barely evident and the artificial sweetener doesn't agree with me. Not at all what I expected.,2
751,"HORRIBLY DRY AND NEON PINK..
DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY , HORRIBLE BRAND MAKES LIPS INSANELY DRY.

761,It broke after the 2nd time i used it. It didn't work good either way. Crappy product i wouldn't recommend it.,1
762,These did not have the red scrubby side they had the grey one and the grey one sucks. Not very good at exfoliating.,3
763,its good and does not slip off your hands. The only downside is that it can easily come off when in your pockets.,3
764,They last a long while. I think they a worth the wait.,4
765,"I like it, it's pretty and serves it's purpose.",4
766,My daughter just recently got braces and uses this waterpik both morning and night to finish off her teeth cleaning routine.  She loves it.,5
767,"Is not to big and doesn't have much elasticity , making difficult to put it on!",3

769,"Love this, once it gets pretty much clear it's ready to go and I love it!!!",5
770,Great stuff .. On the light side for olive skin so if u want to be tanned will look like chalk but great sun and flaw protection,4

775,Item came busted open and the contents leaked and spilled inside of the plastic packaging.,1
776,Cute and comfy .... top were all stitched has hard. not ?? were all the gather lays....,3

807,I am very pleased with this unit.  A great improvement over previous available units.,4
808,Gets the job done and is a good value for the money.,4
809,the applicator sprays out a stream that makes spots on your head. difficult to get a spray that looks natural,2

922,Believe we will need to use it for another few months to see how effective it is.,3
923,"nice doesnot give that smoothness ,but better than razor after bumps and hair removing lotion cream smell,i liked it and use it every week",4
924,I Like the color a little drying on the lips.,4
925,It broke as soon as I opened it. I think it arrived damage.  But its moisturizing and nice shade.,2

927,It peeled and got dirty it looked really weird after like a month and it just peeled a lot and looked gross otherwise it protected well,2

933,Bad product I wish I could return it. The spray broke before I used it! This is a not true what they're telling us,1
934,Really sharp and precise.  Though I wish I could adjust the tension in an easier fashion.,4
935,Very good product for the price. Works on my scruffy beard just fine. Can't beat the cost per shave.,4

962,they don't cover my entire lash and look horrid. save your money!!!,1
963,It lasts long but does turn to patches at the end of the day.,4
964,Seems well made and performs as advertised.  My wife uses it daily and likes it.  It is easy to clean and is a reasonable size.,4
965,"Very disappointing, product crackles and leaves ugly patches all over your lips and wears off quickly, also company didn't give me a return/refund.",1
966,"Way to small, won't fit as a nose ring",1
967,"Besides the pulse for which it was invented, could be used along a metal ruler to perforate paper or other material",3
968,"It is very good this product. The only problem, it is a little tiny for an adult face.",4
969,"Again this was a Christmas gift to my son.  I hope he will enjoy the

1002,The cologne smells good but i have not had any of the effects as everyone else has said they have.,2

1030,I gave this set away.  It was too difficult for me to do my own waxing.  I can't comment on the quality of the product.,3
1031,When it came in the mail it was in two pieces. After I put it back together it works fine.,3

1039,It's Not the best facial product. It is very thick so I ended up using it only for my hands.,2
1040,Used to work well but for some reason since the last 2 purchases it no longer provides adequate protection. I am forced to try a different brand.,2
1041,"I love the Gardenia smell, but this is very strong.

I am not to happy with it, although others may love it!",2

1053,"Awful, its like thick  paste , does not absorb nicely on face. Would not recommend.",1
1054,I do not understand why this product is so highly recommended.  It does not work.  If I could return it I would.,1
1055,When I opened the oriole it was apparent that it was expired we're getting close to.  The potency was not good .,1

1057,DIDN'T EVEN BOTHER OPENING IT!  COULDN'T BE MADE MORE CHEAPLY!  NOT WORTH A STAMP!,1
1058,The on-off switch did not work the second time it was used. We had to pay for shipping to have the item repaired.,1
1059,"The replacement heads were very dull,like they have been used before.",1
1060,Use it for my own eczema and diaper rash... Now I bought it for my baby arriving soon.,4
1061,Good but as many have said not as strong as bronners if you are looking for that strong peppermint scent and feel.,4
1062,"Easy to use, but not terribly effective. Using hydrogen peroxide, baking soda and toothpaste mixture would work just as well and cost much less.",3
1063,Very cute! Kind of annoying to get onto your head evenly but looks so adorable on.,4
1064,"They are only okay, not nearly as good as others I've had.",3
1065,"It broke the first time I used it. The brush came right off, the plastic was stripped where it attached to the handle.",1

1067,the one I bought from target(same color)didn't have glitter and this one does..,2
1068,"Great soap, but it took seller 8 days to ship it.",3
1069,These rings are so cheap they turned rusty after washing my hands while wearing. Will never order from here again.,1
1070,Hands down the best blush on earth. Been using it for over 10 years and don't plan on changing that.,5

1072,Protects really but its too big for my hands and I have small hands...,4
1073,"Very good product. It works as advertised.

One minor drawback is that they recommend completely draining the battery before operating the unit on plug-in power.",4
1074,"Great smell doesn't last long, Equal to the other products it's compared to But way better price... I received very quickly",4
1075,The cover is nice but the fact that it was suppose to come with a free bonus stylus and it didn't was a let down...,2
1076,The ring part broke off from the chain the first time I put it on,1
1077,"Use with new bridge work, Very easy to use, Lots of tips. Great for cleaning and care of all teeth,",5
1078,It was OK for a while but didn't last; would not charge after about 2 years. It should last longer than that.,3
1079,Terrible product!  Barely gets hot and hair gets caught in the barrel by the handle!  Would never recommend to anyone!,1
1080,"I have sensative skin, and I thought this would be soothing, it's okay after a shower, but the scent is much too weak.",3
1081,Cheap and broke easy. Wouldn't buy ever again.,1
1082,"Only have one request- please make the cord retractable.  Otherwise, it is great for the price.",4
1083,"is the best comb I've ever owned
untangles hair effortlessly I",5
1084,"Like everyone else has stated, it barely took off any hair. It didn't burn or anything, but it didn't really take much off.",2
1085,Not the best taste and not the best lube won't buy again but a fun experience for me and my girl.,2
1086,container is much smaller than the last from another supplier for same money.,1
1087,Soap is very harsh. Made my skin sting. There were scratchy rocks inside the soap.,1
1088,"Nice design, but it wold be far better if it was a bit bigger.",3
1089,These brushes are really cute I was just looking for something a little more sturdier.,3
1090,Comes as expected. Not very comfortable behind ears. Good quality though.,4
1091,"Helping with diabetes scars,will continue to use this product",4
1092,You are only going to receive one and it most likely will not be a color listed. Not worth the money.,1
1093,Very high quality and ver pigmented. Once I'm  finished i will re order.,4
1094,This thing is horrible. It makes colored stops in the wall. Does not look like the pictures.,1
1095,The case works well when it is new. With frequent use the velcro wears out. Had to replace it after about 6 months..,3
1096,"These are most definitely not worth $6, maybe a packet of 10 would be.",1
1097,don't buy this if you're dark. It will make you look like you were eating powder doughnuts. It is very smoothe to apply.,3
1098,"Smells pretty bad. I have yet to decide if the reported anti fungal, antibiotic, or antiseptic properties are enough to make the smell worth it",3
1099,This mouthwash really works. I see a big difference in my teeth but it did take longer than seven days to see some whitening.,4
1100,Recieved this during the timeframe stated. All items shown in description was there. I recommend this product.,5
1101,"Shouldn't say ""dog tags"" 'cause there's only one. ""Dog tag"" is appropriate, the military gives two when you join....",3
1102,Worked well. The strips adhere to your teeth much better than ones used in the past.,4
1103,I was looking for a nail buffer.  It removes ridges but I have yet to discover how it might buff my nails too.,4
1104,does what its intended purpose is. shorter options would be nice as i don't always need 14ft,4
1105,I didn't like this product it smudged all under my eyes throughly the day,1
1106,"Lawnmower sound. Can't shave at 6am because you might wake up the entire neighborhood. Works effectively, however. No regrets despite the annoying noise.",3
1107,This brush lasted for a whole two months....crap....don't buy,1
1108,"the product seems good, but the problem is it feels oily and make my face look shiny if wearing alone.",3
1109,Smells good. Works pretty well in my daughters thick wavy hair.,4

1113,Lipstick does not stay on for long. Always reapplying it.,4
1114,"These work for years, on our second one after 5 years of use in hard water area.",5
1115,Detangles at first.  Something in ingredients is sticky and as it builds up causes more tangles in hair.,2
1116,This product is excellent for a mouth wash or for irritations in the mouth.  It is easy to use and does what it is supposed to do.,4
1117,Makes my 2 year old girl's hair smell funny after just a couple hours.,2
1118,Bottles were unsealed and in a used plastic bag.  We did not feel safe using them and threw them all away!,1
1119,"the bracelets are made of cheaper materials, however they are great for the price. they are cute gifts for girls.",3
1120,I loev using this product.  It truely leaves your skin feeling very smooth and not stubbly after you shave.  I highly recommend it!,5
1121,"Am still using it, it's been 3 weeks however there is not that much of a change in hair growth",3
1122,"not really what i was expecting, but its okay...",3
1123,No surpirses. It works as expected. I feel clean and fresh after I use it.  I only wish the resevoir is a littel bit bigger.,4
1124,the tangle free  hot air brush does not work well to untangle hair from the brush .,2
1125,These came quickly and are a heavier duty product then I thought I was getting. Excellent product for the price!,5
1126,this design is better than the other one on amazon. should make it more flesh toned,3
1127,Works great I clamped it on my kitchen table and it worked fine.,4
1128,Smells pretty good. My children use it and it's worked pretty good on their crazy wavy hair. Nice knowing there are no harsh chemicals!,4
1129,This is such a nice creamy bottom butter. Silky smooth and smells oh so good. It's great on those little newborn scratches too!,5
1130,"I've tried a LOT of products, but this is literally the only thing that takes care of my acne scars.",5
1131,My husband and sons have all been using this product for a decade. They love it . They find it perfect for their needs.,5
1132,"I used this product for over 5 years, still like it for it coverage & easy to use.",4
1133,Great stand. Well crafted with beautiful chrome finish. I use it for my Escali badger brush and a Merkur double edge razor.,5
1134,not the best brushes but you get what you pay for.,3
1135,Threw it away.  Was supposed to be brown but was red on lips,1
1136,Very nice. Solid construction. Look forward to many years of use.,4
1137,The box made it appear that these may be expired inventory.,2
1138,Will never purchase any of their products again! This spray had my scalp feeling like it was on fire because it burned so bad!,1
1139,Been using for 4 weeks! No noticeable change! Will continue to use hopefully I can come back and change my review!,1
1140,Kinda silly you have to turn off while holding unit.  Works well.  Overpriced.,3
1141,"Didn't help at all with my stretch marks and it was very hard to apply on the skin, the stick kept pushing back in",1
1142,"Release did not work.  If I can't release I will burn my hair, had to return.",2
1143,They are not very sturdy they bend off when you side sleep.  They don't stay on very good they don't last 30 days. Expensive.,3
1144,They don't really fit to your eyes. My eyes still feel irritated after tanning even when I wear these.,2
1145,Dont think it works as well as the free samples but its ok.,3
1146,Great product for a great price you cant go wrong. If your start starting to wet shave this is a must,4
1147,"Keeps my babies looking greasy but at least I don't have to worry about cracked, dry or bleeding skin.",4
1148,"Ordered it and the bottle wasn't the same as the picture, I was quite disappointed.",1
1149,The motor is already burned out . Need a refund. I was extremely dissatisfied. Will never by this brand again if I can help.,1
1150,"Very nice powder, it is very fine as far as texture. Has a very nice scent.",4
1151,Probably did not need to buy these now as I see now that the Jerden vanity mirror comes with a spare.  but this should last for years,4
1152,"Love this because it lasts forever!! It's gentle and works great with cloth wipes, my baby's bottom is rash free.",5
1153,Have used this product for years.  With my fine thin hair it works great.!,4
1154,bit heavy use very little and not more than once a week!,4
1155,Very thin nail tips and a little hard to work with because of how delicate they are. I will not reorder.,3
1156,"compared to the old Waterpik I replaced, this model barely has enough water pressure to get the job done.",2
1157,I love them but not for people with big heads like me lol I just carfully screached them and there ok now they don't hurt my head anymore,4
1158,"Why is it so small, the size is not worth the money.",2
1159,Love the aroma of the Kai but it doesn't seem to stay with you long.,4
1160,My husband uses this product and has used it for many years. He likes this brand better than any other.,4
1161,the tattoo machines are junk because they have a design flaws... the screw hole for the spring is off and makes the armature bar sit crooked,2
1162,"I owned it for over 3 months, it works well with only one charge.",5
1163,Not a super close trim. but otherwise works fine.,3
1164,"Pricey, but a perfect, happy color. Will be a re-purchase.",5
1165,the shaver is a great shaver but the blades dull very fast. the replacement parts make it work like new.,4
1166,"If you wear contacts, this is the best product for washing your hands prior to handling your contacts.",5
1167,Do yourself a favor and don't buy this.  It barely runs long enough to use it.  The battery life is maybe 3 minutes.,1
1168,Bottle was open and not sealed and half spilled in package,1
1169,Super easy to use.  Blends great! I just wish there was more of it in a single can.,4
1170,They are great. So happy with the quantity and they are on time,4
1171,"Natural and cleans well, but smells very strongly. I personally think it smells like old lady... won't be purchasing again.",3
1172,Solution does not dry up properly. Would rather stick to the homemade solution.,1
1173,"The picture was misleading to me. However, It would likely do  the job it is intended for.",3

1175,"very surprise, and very happy. i will never go anyplace to order again. good happy goood happu goood happy gooog",4
1176,"Good product. I use it to add to laundry soap that i make at home. Pleasant fragrance, arrived on time....",4
1177,"Smells amazing, I use it right before bed & it truly does help",5
1178,I was disappointed.  The one size fits all is a misnomer. The toe loops kept sliding off because they were too wide for my toes.,2
1179,Okay I guess. Don't use them much anymore because I changed to a hoop.,2
1180,This is not a travel dryer. It is not small.,1
1181,You get what you payou for. Gems fall out very easily.,1
1182,Love the soap. Not crazy about the staples I found in it!!,3
1183,The flosser works well however there are times that it cuts off. I turn it off and re-start it again and it is fine,4
1184,"These brushes are amazing, enough said. very smooth on brush on perfectly",5
1185,"Love it!  Scent is refreshing not over powering. Also, the 3 in 1 is great for traveling.",5

1187,"I love this wig! I thought it was going to look cheap crappy, but it looks great and the color is beautiful!",5
1188,All of them were bent and already wore out.  I don't recommend these at all.  Doesn't even deserve one star!!!,1
1189,Great price and quality. So much better than the disposable razors I was using. I will keep buying these.,5
1190,Holds quite a bit. It's also made well!,5
1191,"I used this product once, washed it off and then it no longer worked!!",1
1192,Really helps to give me fullness and volume...But too much can dry out my hair.,4
1193,Coverage ok for mild blemishes but not for serious flaws.,3
1194,"Greasy on application, but leaves your skin very soft after it soaks in.",4
1195,I got this to complete set of shaving stuffs for my husband and it is really great! Shipped as expected.,5
1196,I had a problem with the beard trimmer guards losing teeth after only a few uses. I think this product is very flimsy.,2
1197,"Helps me breath easier, clears up sinus area. Yes, I will purchase this product again.",4
1198,"it's a big one, check the quantity before buying.",4
1199,The texture is kind of heavy and it's not easy to apply,2
1200,These are very small and stretch out after one use.,1
1201,"Outstanding performance and lasts a long time on one recharge.  HOWEVER , you can get this one at Cotsco for 80 bucks.",5
1202,"They are not long enough to fit all my hair pulled back, but that's not the fault of the barrette.",3
1203,Not as powerful as I thought it would be.  Takes a while to dry hair.  Good to follow-up a higher wattage blow-dryer.,3
1204,"Very sharp, but why does it bleed when you use it?",4
1205,Does a good job at making nail colors matte but it took me 2 coats for the matte I think it should be.,4
1206,I would normally give this 5 stars because I love the product! But I just realized... my order did not come with the dropper!,4
1207,Was very pleased to find this on Amazon. I like to dust after a shower. Jean Nate has such a pleasant fragrance.,4
1208,"i have tried every teeth whiting product and none of them deliver, niether does this one",2
1209,Great for head cover around the house especially for chemo patients or if you have thin hair and like to cover head at night.,3
1210,"I've used this blush for years, and its fantastic.  I'd recommend it and plan to continue using it.  The color flatters most people.",5
1211,Bought these for my daughter's birthday.  She said they were great.,4
1212,"They do not stick well to the fabric. Bunch up, not comfortable.",1
1213,These brushes are very firm and great for makeup! Although 2 of them lose some of the brush parts which is annoying when putting makeup on.,4
1214,It's ok for a beginner I would recommend a lil more better/expensive one,2
1215,The product is an old favorite and hard to find.. the site had it in stock and shipped it quickly.  thanks!!,5
1216,The clippers are pretty good. They are smaller than I expected and not as sturdy as I would have liked but hopefully they will hold up well.,4
1217,"So far, so good. Suction cups stick nicely and the pillow is very comfy!",4
1218,"It doesn't work. It does't last long, max is 1 hour",2
1219,Seems to work in reducing odor however the green poop does take a bit of getting used to .,3
1220,this sucks does not work at all total scam rip off false advertisement for thieft of your money,1
1221,a bit too expensive but my 11yr old boy likes it.,4
1222,I bought this product based on a YouTube recommendation. It has an unpleasant odor and this application. I will not be repurchasing.,3
1223,"What I ordered was delivered on time. The product was what I expected.  For the price, they are perfect",4
1224,Memories of years ago. Loved it then. Love it now!,5

1226,What a luxury! Skin is so soft and clean!,5
1227,Everything was going fine... Until I opened the sealed box and found the lid brokennn....,2
1228,"Makes makeup a cinch, a fine product for quick touch ups and travel.",5
1229,This soap is not good to u  my obgyn  said not to use,1
1230,Once you get used to working with it is very good. Even after brushing & string flossing still gets more food from between teeth.,4
1231,"This product is okay, just doesn't work well for me.",3
1232,"Beautiful lotion.
But same exact price as my local drug store...",3
1233,Didn't last at all. Color is great but the quality is not so great,2
1234,"Not as nice as in the photo, very disappointed.",2
1235,"Great product fast shipping, instead of Taking 3 take 4 works better",4
1236,"Don't waste your money these were terrible, did not stick at all :( cannot return this item.",1
1237,I was hoping for it to help with my sun spots. I have been using for 3-4 weeks with no results.,1

1239,I  really like this my dental health has improved and I enjoy how easy it is to use and store,4
1240,It's OK for traveling.  Does not have strong stream.,3
1241,I received this product today and used it today. The scent is wonderful. I will gift others with this package. Love it,4
1242,This did not firm my arms! I don't even have much loose skin and I didn't notice any difference.,1
1243,This is my hubby favorite toy... He use it for his head... yeap for shaving his head and it works perfectly.,5
1244,"First off, be sure to get as close to your hair color as possible. You won't be disappointed. This stuff is really amazing!",5
1245,"Shiny, looks just like picture. Falls over quite frequently though",3
1246,Works great for making the past shave balm I wanted.,5
1247,Works well but still a little tacky even after 5 minutes. Leaving me with needing to either stay put longer or risk chips,3
1248,Got this on a promo i can complain about it works well. I just wish that the blades were cheaper to buy,4
1249,Been using for weeks and does not work to properly cover smell,1
1250,Love this soap and I like the bundle because the assortment is great.,5
1251,Been looking for this item and can no longer locate in a store. Great to use to add body to hair.,5
1252,the rings are nice but one of them were broken when the package came . however the one I really wanted was the one that was broken.,4
1253,The serum soaks in well. I have sensitive skin and tolerate it perfectly. Works on wrinkles somewhat but not a miracle.,4
1254,"It's easy to make it on your own but I would not recommend it. Alcohol, also evaporates over time when stagnant",4
1255,They look nice and it fits really nice if you're petite. My niece really likes it.,4
1256,Cheaply made. But pretty much what I was expecting I guess.,2
1257,Ordered this multiple times! Love it! Makes my fair skin look so nice,5
1258,The smell is a bit off putting and the beads are soft so they don't feel like they are exfoliating as much as I expected.,3
1259,Great product!  I use it for my beard and its wonderful.,5
1260,They are all the Same color they are not different colors... They came earlier than what they said which is a plus,3
1261,comes in handy on occassion.  Water squirts all over the place!!,4
1262,"Love the color and size, but the fact that there are scratches all over it was very disappointing. It seem to be already used",2
1263,The stick is too hard.  Both of my children hate it.  It's easier to just use a lotion type sunblock for their face.,2
1264,Fit true to size. Very cool with mesh on back! Would recommend to anyone!,5
1265,"Gloves are nice, not overly abrasive. However it was delivered with. Giant hole in one of the gloves so I'm a little disappointed.",1
1266,"Will not pump product out, only way to get it to come out is to turn upside down to feed into pump",1
1267,They're light bulbs.  What more can a person say?,5
1268,"it's a simple object, uncomplicated, easy to use, quick to use, easy to clean with the final result that my teeth feel cleaner after",5
1269,This is the best cream I know of for really calloused feet or elbows.,4
1270,I feel my tooth clean and comfort after using it. But a little inconvenience is that it can only be used five minutes whin 2 hours.,4
1271,Nice little stand!!  Good bang for the buck!,4
1272,I did not see any improvement in my facial dryness. Dermal Therapy worked lots better & you get more bang for your  buck.,1
1273,"This is very pretty. My daughter loved it. However, it was not as sturdy/well made as I expected for the price.",3
1274,"Very hard to peel backing off of tape, and once you apply it it has no sticking power.  Really bad product.",1
1275,This stoped my cystic breakouts its amazing .wondering why its not priced higher but glad its not.! I will be buying more,5
1276,The picture of this item is false and does not show the true difference between the 3000 and 3600 foils that are not replaceable.,1
1277,"this was ok, i have used better, i didn't keep my edge slick down as long as the others i have used",3
1278,"Good product, especially for people like me who don't like mint. Try finding these unflavored ones in stores!",4
1279,I have to use a light hand in applying and use the brush immediately to soften the look.,4
1280,To sticky. Goes on like sticky glue and stays that way till it rubs off,1
1281,This is the bomb! Used for zombie effects of peeling skin and made prosthetics with it too.  Really great quality.,4
1282,slip constantly.  was better off with the felt version.,1
1283,"I found these to be good quality brushes for the price. Would definitely recommend to friends, especially as a starter kit.",4
1284,I had two horrible allergic reactions to this.  I cannot recommend Aquaphor.  I looked like a swollen person.,1
1285,"The DVD only teaches, but does NOT have a workout part. Very disappointing.",1
1286,Just didn't like it...i ended up with a lot hair stock under..,1
1287,Some improvement however after 30 days of use will probably try other .,3
1288,My doctor recommend these and I take them when I start feeling like I have stomach problems,5
1289,"Easy to use, easy to set up, I'm extremely pleased. I've never been a good flosser and now that is changing. Highly recommended",5
1290,"This actually makes my vagina burn and hurt, I don't recommend it",1
1291,Great deal and leaves my kids smelling awesome!  I bought a box of them years ago and we still have some left!!!,5
1292,This stuff is surprisingly nice! Feels like it's actually helping my dry nails. Not oily and absorbs quickly,4
1293,I had someone follow me to ask what I was wearing.  Smells great and lasts a long while. I will buy again.,5
1294,"Great seller, product was as advertised, arrived quickly, and I would purchase again.",5
1295,Smells great. Love that castile soap is so versatile.,4
1296,Have used these ovals for years......they work great.  Other brands leave lint and fuzz on your face but these don't.,5
1297,This product does not allow you to get close enough to keep your beard or mustache closely trimmed.,2
1298,I had a hard time using this.  I even tried it on my daughter and still had a challenge.  I wouldn't recommend it.,1
1299,I love this stuff! The texture takes getting used to but it is fantastic.  Too bad Costco doesn't sell it anymore,5
1300,Wish it was longer can't use as a scarf.,2
1301,My dermatologist recommended it for my psoriasis... it does help,4
1302,Looks just like the picture. Very cute. It didn't take too long to receive.  Seems to be made well. Nice product.,4
1303,My husband and I bought this for ourselves so we would not need wax floss.  Our teeth feel great after cleaning them with this flosser.,4
1304,Use this on a regular basis. My dermatologist is the person who recommended this item. I am on my second jar.,5
1305,The finish on this has not lasted at all.  Very disappointing !!!,1
1306,Exactly what we needed for our homemade lotion. Fast shipping.,5
1307,"I wanted a nice looking wrap to wear at the gym while I am drying my hair and putting make-up on, and this one is perfect.",5
1308,"They get the Job done, not as soft as I expected but I like them",4
1309,"Hard to find this size, so am very happy to have it.",4
1310,"Too bad one star is the minimum. This item is total garbage, do not buy!! Zero suction when operating, does not work.",1
1311,"I bough 2set just few time used
battery not charged inup that is juck",1
1312,"not like they used to be.,somewhat dull. Not nearly as many shaves as other brands. Feather is my go to.",3
1313,Love all these products for their simplicity and great smell.,4
1314,"It dries my hair, doesnt help to reduce dandruff. I have to use very less shampoo nevertheless it dries.. don't know how this got higher ratings",1
1315,IT IS TRUE.  THIS SHAVER DOES SHAVE YOUR NECK CLOSER THAN THE OLD NORELCO SHAVERS DID.,4
1316,"This product works great, but don't let the picture fool you. It does not come with the stand to hold all the pieces neatly together.",4
1317,"Easy to use and my Dentist recommend a water pick ,to help with my gums. So far very satisfied,with the way it cleans.",4
1318,"For someone whose lipstick lasts usually 1 minute,  this is phenomenal  !! It lasts so long and i love the color",4
1319,It is a fine cleaner and massager at the gum line but I still feel I need to floss between my teeth.,2
1320,"Haven't really seen a difference and I'm almost done with the jar.
Leaves my skin soft though",2
1321,These are really great ! I had them before and could not find them until I seen on Amazon,5
1322,"not as good as I thought it would be, and cost to much.",2
1323,"It hurt my eyes so much, I don't recommended at all",1
1324,does not work for my dandruff problem.  I wash with it 2 times a day and the flakes return every time,1
1325,Quite good. Some colors come very light though and only show up on white nail polish.,4
1326,"I bough 2set just few time used
battery not charged inup that is juck",1
1327,I paid $20 less for this product last year. I love the product. I'm just shocked about the price increase.,3
1328,"This is a great product. I was afraid it would hurt, but it really doesn't. It's easy to use and I love it.",4
1329,I had this item on for less than one minute before it broke and fell apart. Piece of s***. Waste of money. Don't purchase !,1
1330,I bought this for my husband to use on a regular basis.  It is super easy for him to use. The price was great,5
1331,I found the waterpik ultra too large compared to the apprearance in the internet. And it makes a lot of noise.,3
1332,smaller than I expected...... really like the color verity but not  all little taps don't close so well that's the only issue,3
1333,Love the product because it is a great product that gently softens your skin.  Company is slow to ship.,1
1334,Don't like the smell. Should have ordered magnolia . My mistake.,1
1335,Too hard to get on and off for ladies with large breasts.  Only wore one once and then gave away.,1
1336,this is okay but u have to actually leave the darn belly butt in the ligh for hours for them to work,3
1337,"I'm conflicted about this review because the product works great! But the stickiness only lasts a few nights, then it's an inferior product.",2
1338,Best products around for the price and for sensitive skin.,5
1339,It works as well as my other air brush for drying  but the tangle fee does not work very well.,3
1340,"Very effective to floss. The adjustable power helps to adjust the pressure in sensitive areas.
Have a fresh feeling after I use it.",4
1341,"They didn't fit my face right. Then, there is also a difficulty with attaching the string and keeping it tied tight.",3
1342,It does not have 3000 rinestone in it. It probably has 150 or 200 maximun,1
1343,Very good product for my father's dry skin!!!,4
1344,I see no use in paying for this.  Just fill you cleaner with a bit of liquid shower soap and water.,1
1345,"Holds my brush AND my razor. If a lady ever came over, I think she would be impressed by this.",5
1346,Make my face feel good.  Haven't had it very long so will update after I have used it longer.,4
1347,Really gets gums and teeth clean but have had problems with pause valve.,3
1348,I thought I found what I was looking for!  Not!  Doesn't moisturize at all,1
1349,"Fast shipping. A bit small, meant for kids. But overall, its good!",4
1350,Beautyblender is bit pricey I think as usual.and lose color in the process of being washed. So I prefer normal Pink one.,3
1351,the tubing was crimped so gets stuck at times.  Disappointing,2
1352,"this is a good product, it makes my daughter's teeth more bright and health.",5
1353,So far this product seems to be everything I was looking for!  The price was much better ordering online than purchasing locally.,5
1354,This product does not work. Do not waste money and it came from China took a month to receive. It deserves no stars,1
1355,Oil is thick and greasy but seems to be affective keeping hair conditioned and moisturized.,3
1356,This clear liquid does not seem to make any difference. The dispensor is a tain wreak. Haad to dispense into a spoon and then use.,1
1357,Good Quality quick charge. Beats the heck out of my former remington trimmer which cut my skin up.,4
1358,"Great gift for beginners. Easy to use, however, following the instruction can be very complicate it.",4
1359,This is great for aches and pains.  Amazing product.  Would highly recommend this product to anyone in need of muscle relief.,5
1360,My curls are awakened with this diffuser! Works great with the Turbo Power hair dryer. Highly recommend it.,5
1361,"I thougt the water tank was big, but it turns out it's the right size for one clean! at least for me.",5
1362,"This was just ok, probably will not order again.",3
1363,"It is an excellent product. However, it didn't work for me.",4
1364,Fits a bit loose and more dull looking than the vibrant picture. But still nice.,3
1365,was recommended to get this for my skin.  the dermatologist brand was too pricy - this is reasonable and seems to do the trick.,5
1366,Decent for price but turned colors within a week if that .. It's cute tho,1
1367,I don't think this really works.. I don't notice my polish drying any faster when I use it.,2
1368,I would recommend better packaging. Two of the colors were broken but over all it was good.,4
1369,Terrible. All of the rhinestones fell out before they were even worn.,1
1370,Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good Good,5
1371,"not paste, hair desprender. no buy. unprofessional, bad buy, not buy back definitivmente. It does not fulfill its function.",1
1372,The bottle sprays in a stream instead of a mist.  I'm going to have to buy a different bottle.,2
1373,I used these on my conair makeup mirror. They all burnt out/exploded and melted the plastic on the mirror and left burn marks.,3
1374,I use this comb right after I get out of the shower. Works just great.,4
1375,"The product works as expected, but it's basically over-priced Vaseline with some additives.",4
1376,"Over all I'm happy with it, but too much money for what you get.",4
1377,Very good shaver.  I don't use them myself but the boys like them.  No complaints,5
1378,I seriously love the smell and the clean feeling I have after my shower.,4
1379,Love our headband kits- we cannot wait to make them :),5
1380,Okay but that's to be expected considering the price.,3
1381,Used this product religiously for a month with no results.,2
1382,"It's okay, but save your money. Its not worth buying",1
1383,I sense it has begun to reduce the estrogen level in my body.,4
1384,Saw this product and thought I would purchase.  It is a bit strong.,4
1385,It worked for my teen son in combo with face wash.,4
1386,I wouldn't have purchased if I knew they were one pair.,2
1387,Exacerbated burning where appliedd for 2 or 3 hours without relief from pain orr discomfort.,1
1388,"Lovely product although it scratches easily, can't complain though since it just makes it look more badass.",4
1389,I've been using for about 2 months. It seems like it's working but very slowly,3
1390,"3 days to san diego.

Fired right up...weird how there's only 5 spots to put tips, but they give you 6 tips.",4
1391,"Great non toxic way to shave.  Husband loves it, leaves your skin soft and it does dry it up. Love it",5
1392,String keeps falling off. But it's great! I use em everyday in tanning bed.,3
1393,Doesn't glide. Good if you like to suffer.,1
1394,Quality is not that great. Works OK so far.,3
1395,"Bought this for my teenaged son, he loved it!",4
1396,You didn't say that it was made and coming  from  China,1
1397,"well let me say its good so far after 20 days of use, its smooth and shave easely, not very cheap but worth the price",3
1398,"So far, so good.  I'm trying this as a replacement for SeroVital.  Little too early to see effects, if any.",4
1399,Broke out in hives. Worst latex I had ever used for costumes.,1
1400,The item looks much nicer in the pictures. It is not what I expected. Very cheap looking.,1
1401,"Doesn't do much for my pores, but it feels good and takes off leftover makeup that cleanser doesn't catch.  Lasts a really long time.",3
1402,I have long hair and they hold my securely. Great buy.,4
1403,"It's an excellent waxed floss, especially good for tight fitting teeth!",4
1404,"Just right.
Sharp, but doesn't snag.

I have thick facial hair and sensitive skin.",5
1405,Simple product. Not much to say they're what you buy at walmart or the srt of shaving. A must for brawn razors,5
1406,Very good product being using for 50 years or more.,4
1407,Good product for maintaining my break-out prone facial skin.  I felt the face wash was too weak so I use the body wash all over.,4
1408,It was ok.  don't think I will order any more.,3
1409,Love it.  Glad to find a place to get it at a reasonable price.  Thanks Amazon.,5
1410,Gave it a 2 stars becauseThe container too fragile it Crack really quick but love the product,2
1411,It's ot Myomin Plus.  i am returning today.,1
1412,"This product was recommended to me by my dentist, and it is by far the best on the market. Purchasing online in bulk is very convenient.",5
1413,"I'm actually recommending this baby shampoo for your little ones, because it smells so sweet and it's safe as well.",5
1414,This company also makes the same product in a silver can (maybe a newer formula) and I like it much better than this product!,3
1415,Work great. It lasted for over a year then the plastic tube broke.,5
1416,Half of the oil spilled all over the package when i opened it. Smells great but everythING is so oily and messy.,2
1417,"Pretty mild blade in a Merkur 34c.  No worries about nicks or cuts with this blade, even for a beginner!",4
1418,"Heats up quick, has long bristles to hold a good amount of hair, VERY long cord",4
1419,handsome and functional. I bought this and then I bought some sandalwood shave soap from another supplier. Highly recommend this bowl.,5
1420,Does what it's supposed to and fits my tweezerman eyelash curler.,5
1421,Not good but not bad either. Just a primer for lashes really.,3
1422,"Booo the small was just a size medium just a little shorter, if you're looking for a good size small barber jacket get a Diane one",1
1423,"It leaks water from just below where you put the attachments on. It is so messy to clean up, that I've hardly used it.",2
1424,Haven't even used it yet because the thought of putting this on my hair when it smells so bad is frightening!!,1
1425,Very moisturizing but too greasy for the face in tropical climates.,4
1426,Only one pair in the package.  Does its job wish I got more for my money,3
1427,This hair is a hit mess it tangles matted up and sheds really bad ladies please don't buy this its not worth it,1
1428,What the voltage for this model? Dose it work with 240V ?,4
1429,After 1 month the switch on the handle sticks.  I would not recommend this product.  Product is not well made.,2
1430,"does the job. has many option and features. cant say that its the best machine ive seen, but it worth its price",4
1431,My husband found this neither efficacious nor pleasant. I enjoyed it more than he did.,3
1432,It works and I'm happy with it. No problems.,4
1433,Absolutely love it. Does the job as stated in description. Fast Shipping. Great Product. Give it a try you will love it.,5
1434,Good product but not as sharp as i would have expected.,3
1435,"Boils the water way to fast, doesn't allow the coffee cook.",4
1436,I just love the smell of this stuff and also it feels so soothing when I put it on my face. very nice product,5
1437,"Sturdy plastic, not much description on how to use.",3
1438,"Comfortable, i thought they would br flexible but its ok still and they barely glow",3
1439,I tried these gloves in the shower and while they worked well with my body scrub they had a few snags but they did the job.,4
1440,"My husband has the shaver and can't find the solution in the local stores, not even Wal-Mart? Keeps razor clean!",4
1441,Defects in the 'nubs' at the tips of the bristles left many of the bristles sharp and uncomfortable on the scalp. I expected better quality control.,3
1442,This is my favorite shirt EVER!  I have 6 to make sure I have a clean one at all times!,5
1443,I ordered the large one and I got the small / Medium - so Im rating the service not the comb it self,3
1444,"It seems as though the first can I bought stuck better, I had more success using it; know it is hit or miss.",3
1445,Didn't last as long as expected.  It does not stay on through out the night while I sleep.,3
1446,Product works great and as  described and does a good job of trimming. I would recommend this product for trimming jobs.,5
1447,Good fragrance...not as moisturizing as I would like.,4
1448,"These get VERY hot so be careful.  I have used a couple of times, but they get too toasty for my hands.",3
1449,I like the bottle but the scent in not my favorite,3
1450,Nice unit for the cost and size. Operates quietly enough with enough power to get fresh teeth. Should help with the future dentist visits.,4
1451,"I like the product because it is efficient, and priced right. What I do not like is that it has little amount, but I recommend",4
1452,My daughter loves these. Great price for how much you get.,5
1453,"The brush its totally disapointed coz the material is so cheap n rough...
Till now i never use it coz the hair brush keep fallin",1
1454,"Ohhhh the horrible, terrible SMELL of it caused me to discard it same day. The smell is just overpowering and nasty.",1
1455,"Love the smell of this cream - nice consistency, too.",4
1456,Great deal for the money. Only buy products fulfilled by Amazon. They come quicker,5
1457,Expected more of a mauve but it's much darker. I have pale oliveskin (but brown eyes)but this looks like I smeared chocolate on myself,2
1458,"Very cheap lotion course, if I was sold almost expired!",1
1459,Eh... it's a stick.  Not super easy to apply.,1
1460,undle Monster Cosmetic Brush Set was a birthday gift for my niece. She loved it. It had all the make-up brushes that she needed.,4
1461,I love them but I got a lot of doubles.. not too happy about that.,4
1462,"I wish it had a warm setting, in addition to hot and cool.",3
1463,"I wouldn't recommend this prouduct to anyone.  I wanted to loose weight.  Thought, yeah need help. NO help at all.",1
1464,bad for acne prone skin. I used one day and woke up with lots of clogged pores,3
1465,"good products, sometimes hard to find. don't try to rinse completely with body wash.",4
1466,Not really strong and doesn't fix bad breath. I would try something else.,2
1467,Works as it should be. I use it for more than 4 months. The battery is really a good one.  I only recharge it once.,4
1468,"This is a waste of money. I should have never bought it.
DO NOT BUY this product, it is a ripoff",1
1469,"Works well. A little loose fitting, especially at the bottom near the charging port. Feels good in your hand. Great price.",3
1470,Solid product. Helps get the leftover gunk out of my teeth a picker can't.,4
1471,"It is a very weak razor and does not hold charge.
I have used electric razor for 15 years and this is the worst one...",1
1472,"Works more quickly in sunshine, for some reason.  Does take quite a bit of time, but no one can tell I've done anything.",5
1473,I have this rating because the product works extremely will with my blowdryer.  I am happy that I bought this product thank you.,5
1474,"Hides my gray between color well.  Easy to spray the targeted areas, doesn't bleed and looks natural.  Wish it was cheaper",4
1475,the ultimate toothpick without any doubt. I've never used anything that comes close to these. Can reuse endlessly...,5
1476,"For the price the product is good!  Seems to wear out quick, i guess i anticipated more for the buck!",3
1477,These toothbrushes have a larger head. I don't think I would order these again because they are a larger size.,4
1478,Bought as gift.  Takes the whole package to practice using. Time intensive.,3
1479,I got all silver which i like and they seem pretty sturdy but I'll update when i wear them more,4
1480,"They are too weak. Also, they don't hold up for thin hair.",1
1481,"it wasn't what I ordered  the one I ordered was not reverse polarity, just a cp12180xrp .....was not usable at all in my generator.",1
1482,The product works but it only lasts about a month since it is no longer sticky after applying it to the chest regularly.,4
1483,"Liked it, but stopped working relatively quickly after I got it.",2
1484,"Terrible! Shears kept falling apart after using them for only a few days. Don't waste your money, you get what you pay for.",1
1485,"I'm not a huge fan, too bulky and not as user friendly as a regular one.",2
1486,These scissors are easy to hold and manipulate. They are light and very sharp. The case is nice and protective.,5
1487,Didn't like the fact that made my eyes itchy and it didn't make my eyelashes extended.. Might be going back,1
1488,I have used Norelcos for years and each model just seems to get better and beter. This shaver gives me the fastest and closest shave yet.,5
1489,"Stopped working after a month! Great when it worked, but instant death means I can't recommend.",1
1490,Recommended in a woman's magazine for blondes/light brown.  Wrong!!!  Only applied once because it was not a good color.,2
1491,I like a 110 volt electric shaver better than the battery operated ones. The Norelco 6423LC fills this bill for me.,4
1492,"this is my fourth time ordering this product and something has changed, its not the same.",1
1493,"reservoir leaks constantly, have tried washing the valve as recommended without any success
just makes a mess, had same one before worked great",1
1494,It is a little more then I wanted to spend but I like the product,5
1495,Very pricey!! Buy at Wal-Mart! Better price!,3
1496,"A good value; don't stay sharp as long as the wilkinson sword, but at the price, not a problem.",4
1497,"makes my skin very smooth.
i got this on the 28th and it was expected to arrive from 28th to jan 2?",4
1498,Wonderful product! Potent scent is very relaxing and it leaves skin soft. One of my favorites from Dr. Teal's!,5
1499,"The product smells wonderful, but contains the harmful chemical sodium lauryl sulfate.",3
1500,"As expected, this is exactly what I was looking for. I would definitely recommend for anyone looking for  this item",4
1501,"not impressed. arrived on time. i would not purchase this item again.very unhappy with this product, i would not recommend it to friends.",1
1502,"This product is nothing more than a moisturizer!
The results on TV were instant and significant.
 I have not seen anything near that.",1
1503,"It seems to work ok, nothing I would call ""amazing"" or ""a must have"".",3
1504,"This lip color is just a little lighter than I was expecting; otherwise, it is a great product.",4
1505,Gets rid of the dead skin better than just a towel,4
1506,Looks great on the countertop and does a good job holding a blade and brush.,5
1507,I actually used this on my armpits and it works the same way. Thumbs up!,5
1508,Great price for item; item received as described; fast shipping; would buy from again.,5
1509,"Great looks and function but will not hold many modern 5-blade razors, especially those with pivoting heads.",4
1510,yeah it did the job but it smelled weird and i'm definitely allergic to it,2
1511,"I received these 3 days after ordering.. Cant wait to try this out, these were much cheaper than buying them at the tanning salon.",5
1512,My grandchild just loved this dog! She insists that it protects her tooth until the thooth fairy arrives.,5
1513,This razor is way above other brands in quality and speed.  It's also very quiet.and Norelco makes better shavers for a little more money.,4
1514,Works well. Color good but makes hair dull and scalp itchy,3
1515,Smells amazing! And I love how it's a spray so it's much easier to use and fast.,5
1516,"The shape is similar to the picture, but the scraping edge is way too thick to scrape with. It's not thin like the picture.",2
1517,this really works and takes few days to be free of bad habit.,5
1518,i need more info on this product. haven't seen much reviews as far as sensitive skin. please help,3
1519,"I didn't care for this lipstick, it felt to dry on my lips.",2
1520,Color started to fad alot after just a few days.,1
1521,"I liked it a lot, but my wife did not. Now, I would've given it 5 stars, but, it leaks.",3
1522,Exactly what was described.  Perfect case for a great price.,4
1523,"I would order from this seller again.  Service was great, as stated, securely wrapped and recieved sooner than expected.",5
1524,"this  is a very good product line.  the drawback was, in my opinion, slow delivery",4
1525,New heads work and fit great! This is the second time to purchase replacement heads which extend the life of a good razor.,5
1526,Good especially loss them all the time!! Good price,5
1527,It wasn't as effective as i'd hoped..but others may feel otherwise. everything arrived on time.,3
1528,Leaves my skin very soft but i still have the black heads ,3
1529,These are fun! I like how they are easy to use. They help create that awesome look! Love these and will be ordering more.,3
1530,"i love this perfume! and is in a very convenient presentation now i can carry with me all the time =), and is so sweet!",5
1531,Moved from a Mach 3 to this and I cant say there is much of a difference but it cut my hairs well.,4
1532,I wasn't please withe the product but made the adjustment. I won't recommend this product but to each his or her own.,3
1533,Awesome! I filled little jars with this for my bridesmaids and they loved it!!,5
1534,"Magnet didn't work, so we had to hold it together with a twist tie.",1
1535,this product was not affective and really turned my eyes red and blurred my vision.  I did not apply it near my eyes.,1
1536,When I saw the price on this shaver I thought I was getting a great bargain. I guess you get what you pay for.,1
1537,Loved this spong so much!! I bought one  for a gift and will be getting myself another one soon too!,5
1538,"blades are ok hubby says, not as sharp as the ones that came with the razor we bought.",3
1539,"very good . I like it very much .  a nice one.  i will buy one more next time , good",5
1540,Blades get dull after one shave... RUBBISH!!!,2
1541,Fragrance seemed to have been old.  Smell was  not good. Had previously used this product for a long time.  Will not purchase again.,1
1542,I love the Kai fragrance and was happy to have this travel size to take with me on vacation.,5
1543,I gave 4 stars because it needs a powder to remove the humidity and an oil to remove the wax. It's very nice and good quality.,4
1544,Arrived opened  and leaking all over the box.  Tried shampoo but didn't help at all.  Still so itchy.,1
1545,THIS WAS A GIFT PURCHASED LAST YEAR FOR MY DAUGHTER WHO ABSOLUTELY LOVES CURVE FOR WOMEN AND WHO COULD PASS UP THE PRICE I PAID!!,5
1546,Bough this for making wood butter. Works just like I expected,4
1547,They suck I never received my I team andI wrote them a whole. Bunch of times and no response back!! Not once!!,1
1548,Best brand I have found. One blade last me around two weeks.,5
1549,"Didnot have the holder for everything and it also has the charger built right into the holder , witch I didnot recieve.",3
1550,"Too big for my hands, and threads all over. Nail salon had a much better version for $5. Would not buy again.",1
1551,Love love love derma e & this product is exactly what I wanted!,5
1552,"These are very big, which is what I need. However, the plastic is rather thin so I don't expect these to last very long.",3
1553,"I like the brush iron, the only problem is the tip of the barrel gets really hot so be careful.",4
1554,"Works great, but does not provide a close shave as with soap or shaving cream.  It does work on nicks and ingrown hairs!",4
1555,"It will definitely do the trick.  Can be kind of noisy on the strongest setting, but aside from that, I have no complaints.",4
1556,"This product works well. I love how it's small, adjustable, and waterproof. Even after dropping it on the floor, it still works.",4
1557,Great blades fantastic price. using a double edge razor is the way to go. Astra are the best blades I have used yet.,4
1558,Thus color is simple but cute. It gives you that not more such makeup look like going natural but not really.,4
1559,This cleans and exfoliates nicely...warm water/soap of your choice and it will leave you smooth and refreshed ,4
1560,Arrived early and are very pretty. They get the job done and they're great travel size!!,5
1561,"great, kind of narrow container however and will not fit a large shampoo comb",5
1562,Not good for anything. Pulls hair; doesn't cut it. Not sharp enough or powerful enough. Couldn't find anything useful for it.,1
1563,it was very nice till the heart broke off after a week :(,3
1564,Its good for the price. It has a back end that flips up to let you shave without killing your skin,4
1565,I thought lighter color but came out darker shade. Maybe what they need is someone model the color or something before we purchase lipstick color.,4
1566,"3 days to san diego.

Fired right up...weird how there's only 5 spots to put tips, but they give you 6 tips.",4
1567,I like these blades over other brands. They are super sharp and I never have an issues with them.,5
1568,Something in this product burns my skin. I couldn't use it.,2
1569,"Really cheap looking and feeling, but it works as intended.",3
1570,"Reasonable price and Very effective. Although I did not get 'white' teeth after using it for a week, my teeth definitely became whiter!!!",4
1571,Didn't lay my edges down at all. Very greasy.,1
1572,"It's great, buttttt it leaves white residue in your hair. It actually holds edges down tho",4
1573,"I love this soap! It has Shea butter and is triple milled. The scent is just right. Not over powering.
I will buy again!",5
1574,Very happy except a travel case would be nice.  Too many loose parts otherwise.  Have not tried using it in wet conditions.,4
1575,Very good plateau buster for regular tanners. Prevents redness and makes skin feel soft and firm after regular use in tanning booths.,4
1576,"I'm a small guy around 5'7"" and the jacket was huge on me feels like paper but alright for the price the cape is good",1
1577,Oh how I love my cup!!! I will never go back to tampons!,4
1578,Liked the smell of it...I actually gave this to my nephew...he likes it.,4
1579,"Great brushes, cheap but not made cheaply. The travel case is pretty but I wasn't that impressed with the case.",4
1580,seems very well made and looks great! highly recommended!,5
1581,We have had a lot of struggles with this diffuser. I wouldn't order it again.,2
1582,Seam along zipper ripped out on the first wear and its non returnable so I'm stuck with it,1
1583,Smells wonderful!  I use it for my office diffuser.,5
1584,Overall good but would be helpful with longer cord and easier to turn off,4
1585,works a lot better than the cheaper norelco and holds charge for awhile no indicator when charge is getting low.,5
1586,"Good shave but not quite as sharp as the Feather Platinum.  I am alternating them though, trying to figure out my favorite.",4
1587,I only got blue and purple but other than that they are great,4
1588,LOVE IT! I can't wait to receive my next jar. THANK YOU!,4
1589,It was well packaged and exactly how it was shown!,5
1590,My headband was broke when I took it out of the package. Not satisfied at all. I got what I paid for.,1
1591,"Product description says pack of 4, but I only received 1 despite the price tag of 16 bucks. What a misleading rip off",1
1592,"luscious color, fuzzy gloss tip squeeze applicator can be a little difficult, just because you have to concentrate on how much you are squeezing when applying",4
1593,It broke after only a few uses. Seemed to be made of very cheap material. I would not recommend this product.,2
1594,"Nice, soft bristles for cleaning the cracks and crevices of your shaver. I say get two or three of these.",4
1595,"This brand is ok, but the best Vitamin Serum in amazon with real effect in 2 weeks is Bellafab Serum.",3
1596,Very hard to squeeze out of the tube.  I definitely prefer the jar.,1
1597,"Faithful user of this product, love it. No parabins or SLS.",5
1598,"For some reason, nowhere near me sells this. Amazon fixed this problem, and I'm now a happy fox.",5
1599,"Nice size, and smells good. Good quality and fair price.",4
1600,Waste of money. I've used this product for almost a year with no results at all.,1
1601,"smell is not ""great"" and thankfully it doesn't last more then 3 min on you.",1
1602,"It's too loose for me, poor material, broke almost inmediately.",3
1603,It's really pretty but is you look really close you can tell it's cheap. But other than that it's great!,4
1604,"excellent value, but gilette sensor blades give me a closer shave.",3
1605,I have never used an electric razor in my entire life.  I wish this dumb company would stop blasting its stupid ads onto my email.,1
1606,This is perfect for my home made beauty products.  And it's a relatively attractive bottle at a great price.  Pump works great.,5
1607,This was just pathetic... product only half full... afraid to use... threw it away.,1
1608,"these brushes are amazing, some of them aren't as well made as the rest but most of them are fantastic i love them!!",4
1609,Ways easier and cheaper than constant dye jobs.  And it doesn't wash out or stain skin.  It is a miracle product in my book.,5
1610,"Had to exchange clips to rotate them properly, and because one clip wouldn't snap into place. Very small, but cute.",3
1611,Won't stick to the shower even after following instructions exactly!,1
1612,"It is a very good product. Smells great, came on time",4
1613,It's comfortable as I put it on but really didn't help with reducing my sweat around my crotch and butt.,3
1614,My order was for the 1 1/2 inch barrel but I received the 1 inch barrell,2
1615,Don't really care for this product.  Way too messy.,2
1616,"I would never buy this product. Instead I like to get a sick thrill from skulking around in the shadows, tricking men into my beige vagina.",1
1617,It was expensive and it wasn't worth the money. My hands were still very dry after using almost the entire tube.,1
1618,I would get it again.  It is a decent value.  It blocks odors and perspiration just like it claims.  It also smells pretty good.,4
1619,Product is like all of OZNaturals amazing.  Goes on smooth.  Noticing firmer skin and fine lines are going away.  Will buy again.,5
1620,"Works exactly like it says it will.

From NZ (240v mains) so had to get a transformer and adapter, but no major issues.",4
1621,"Your product  just leaks all over the sink----I should probably return it, because I find I don't use it..too messyl",1
1622,So good I bit the bullet and bought the big bottle from NM. You won't believe all of the compliments.,5
1623,Its actually the best root cover Ive used . I own a bunch that are sitting now that I have this one .,5
1624,Really cheap. The ball at end of posts are sharp.,2
1625,"Not oily, drys fairly quickly but skin still feels moisturized. Best lotion I have used. This and the other scents are great",5
1626,"I had a bad case of blue waffle and hoped that this ""blushing pink"" product would hide it. My labia are now purple.",1
1627,Wow....got 5 of the same one. Awesomeeeeee. Not,1
1628,Really like this particular Olay product.  Prompt arrival too.  Thank you.,5
1629,I think I got a faulty one because it just didn't work well.  It's also made with cheap plastic.  I'll try another brand.,1
1630,"I like it!
The transport process more careful is better, the bottle rupture in the transport process, half a bottle of cleaning fluid leakage.",4
1631,Water pressure even on highest setting is still poor. After 2 min of using waterloo I still used regular floss. Disappointed,2
1632,"Not as good as murkur blades. Great price, but sometimes you get what you pay for",2
1633,"Waterpikest in the businesst. Does what its designed to do and does it well.
Good price and fast efficent service.",4
1634,Posts are plastic so good for nickel allergy sufferers but unfortunately it makes them much easier to bend or break. Still worth it for what I paid,3
1635,I bought this to replace an old one with a similar model number that has lasted 10 years. This one is horrible.,1
1636,"Does not work. If you have psoriasis, you'll still have it after using this.",1
1637,This is a very good product. I use it as a base for my homemade lotion. It works wonders on the skin.,4
1638,"It started out great, but now I am having trouble with it....Don't know if it will last...",3
1639,I don't think this did anything for my hair. You could probably get way cheaper vitamins and they will do the same or better for you.,2
1640,First set broke too easily. Tried again and the same happened. Also the hook and button are too small and make attaching the socks difficult.,2
1641,Only got about 30 uses out of this before the power button got stuck in the on position. Very poor quality in general.,1
1642,Just what i needed to go tanning in the beds at the gym.  I love the hot pink color! Very comfortable.,5
1643,its perfect for any nail design you want it came in the time they said  I recommend  to anyone who love to do their nails,4
1644,"Great for cuticles and skin, not sure that is good for hair. The product is to greasy and weights hair down",4
1645,"Love this product, but the tube I received was dried up. Definitely old, check for expiration before buying.",2
1646,"My husband loves this product! Great hold, quality and good price.",5
1647,Mine broke after less than two weeks. it simply stopped working! I didn't drop it or anything!,1
1648,"when shaving the on off button keeps turning off the razor because of the grip i have on it, there needs to be a different on off button",1
1649,"Find it too greasy, so don't particularly like it.",3
1650,"They would get the job done, but don't curve with the nail they are kind of flat.",4
1651,Good aftershave.  Matched the reviews I read about it.  Has a barbershop smell to it.  Nice packaging.  Has a classic feel to it.,4
1652,It smells really good and my husband thinks so too ! It seems to be doing what it's supposed to !,4
1653,Does what I expected holding my safety razor and brush. Recommend if you are looking for this type of stand.,4
1654,This looks so pretty with the brush and razor in it.  Very durable.,5
1655,"Great color, but wore off faster than I thought it would",4
1656,Needed so I can refill them myself using the recommended online solution - saves a fee bucks if you're interested.,4
1657,I love this cream!  Really great for Boomer skin.  I keep 1 bottle in each bathroom and travel with it!,5
1658,"So far a great purchase.  I was skeptical, but my teeth/gums have never been cleaner",5
1659,I love this product for spiking my hair.  It works awesome and only takes a little to get big results!,5
1660,"looks good. The only concern is that it could be ""inhaled""????",3
1661,Spray is too strong but it covered the gray and my face.,3
1662,This is easy to handle while massaging my face. Works for slimming face.,5
1663,Maybe I just don't know how to use edge control. Left a white pasty residue.,2
1664,"sadly, this wasn't strong enough for my young boys.  We tried it a couple of times, but they still were stinky:(",1
1665,"worst product.
Got after 1.5 months...

Never purchase item from overseas (china), it will take infinite time...  :(",1
1666,"way uglier in person, will never wear it. the chain is like a quarter machine necklace",1
1667,The only thing sadder than reading the reviews for a loofah is writing one.,4
1668,"Very intense almond smell.
Might want to reconsider if you're looking for a base, any essential oils generally get drowned out by the almond.",3
1669,Too long. Not exactly what i expected but ill find a way to adjust. Deffinitely not true to size,1
1670,I bought these as starter blades for switching back to traditional safety razors. Nothing great to report and nothing negative to report. Made in Russia.,3
1671,These brushes were terrible. I am not mad because you get what you pay for.,1
1672,Works perfecctly. Had one before for many years that finally wore down.  Highly recomend to anyone who values their teeth and gums.,4
1673,"My only complaint is that the picture is blue, but the one that came is red.",4
1674,"Product does not remove ear wax. No suction, just noise, doesnt warm up wax. Would like refund.",1
1675,This is the first time I have purchased anything like this. No attachment cords. Unable to use them.,3
1676,did not work as good as I thought it would:{,2
1677,I think there are a lot of fake reviews here.,1
1678,"TIMELY RECEIVED.  THE ITEM WAS AS DESCRIBED AND IN EXCELLENT SHAPE. WOULD ORDER AGAIN FROM THIS VENDOR.
ALL AROUND VERY PLEASED",4
1679,Worked great for about a month. Then it started leaking all over the sink. Can't figure out why. Don't waste your money.,1
1680,The folding handle is loose; the directional air diverter does not stay on. To much of a pain to send back.,2
1681,"I like it, it does a great job - it is however pretty darn loud.",4
1682,"Carried on trans-Atlantic vacation.  Fit flat in my suitcase, travel home as a cross body purse filled with treats from my travels.",5
1683,"moisturizer made my skin oily, toner irritated my skin, cleanser made my skin dry. Scrub was not harsh and left my skin feeling soft.",2
1684,Friend told me to put it on blind pimple and cover with bandaid.  . Pimple cleared up over 2 days without becoming a whitehead.  Worked well.,4
1685,I am using it everyday to floss my teeth. Very easy to use and easy to clean. Nice product and will recommend it.,5
1686,Didn't do anything besides dry out my face like crazy and made my skin Start flaking off. Plus it burns and is very strong smelling.,1
1687,"NO COLOR AT ALL! CLEAR CLEAR CLEAR ! NOT HAPPY
THANKS",1
1688,seems to be the only thing that keeps my son from having a rash would def recommend,5
1689,I AM SO PISSED OFF. THE CRAP WAS SO WATRED DOWN I COULDNT EVEN USE IT. I WILL NEVER ORDER AGAIN.,1
1690,"The packing was bad, it had came open when I finally got it.  The color also washed out to a dull grey in no time.",2
1691,did not keep tarter build up. I think there are just to many chemicals in our food to use these.,3
1692,Works like a CHAMP AND WORTH THE INVESTMENT.  Shipped right away too :),5
1693,Amazing product.  Great line I have used to replace high end items.,5
1694,The soap is full of particles so its more like a bar exfoliant than a milk soap,2
1695,Best thing I've ever done for my whole mouth. Much healthier gums now...besides cleaner teeth...,5
1696,Not for me but YMMV. The smell in the bottle was better than on the skin.,3
1697,doesn't work. don't waste your money. it definitely does not work for cystic acne. it's crazy over priced and way too oily.,1
1698,I wish they would have been brighter.  They don't seem to be as bright as the bulbs that were originally in the lighted mirror.,2
1699,Good product. Did help clear up my skin. The large chunks of plastic were concerning.,4
1700,"Incredibly small, the whole thing fits in the palm of my (tiny) hand. Incredibly disappointed.",1
1701,This is too thin for winter in Chicago so I am going to hang onto it until next summer when I am sure it will be much better.,3
1702,"If you're nostalgic, this is the aftershave lotion for you. Brings you back to the wild wild west.",4
1703,I ordered the trimmer but did not realize that I would not be getting the trimmer attachments,1
1704,I've been using the product now as directed for a couple weeks and have seen absolutely no benefit to my hair or skin.,2
1705,I tried this product for several weeks and it did not work.  I will stick to my Mary Kay.,1
1706,"This is a good product, but none of these colors are really red...more of a brick red or terracotta. Stays on okay",5
1707,I like this product. Second time I have purchased it.,4
1708,I love this color and how long it stays on my lips.,5
1709,The only soap we use. My son has eczema and this is the only natural soap he can use that won't irratate his skin.,5
1710,Perfect for my bathroom motif and allows me to see when it needs to be re-filled without having to open a lid to check.,4
1711,"Very well made, the only draw back I wish it was another 2"" longer",4
1712,"Just a shade loose on my IPod, not bad though.",4

1714,"The smell of this soap was amazing, and it made me feel extremely clean. I would buy this again, especially since the price is affordable!",4
1715,"Aparelho muito bom para uso dirio, fcil e prtico. Produto chegou antes do prazo e em perfeitas condies de entrega.",4
1716,"Very effective product in a jar of the right size, for use this winter season.",5
1717,"Finished the bottle but, couldn't really see any effects.",3
1718,Company was great and refunded the product but goggles are so small that push into your eyeballs and are a flimsy plastic.  So uncomfortable to wear.,1
1719,"Good response, well packaged, good product, thanks!",5

1723,it stopped working like a minute after i plugged it in,1
1724,"Last for ever, very large volume of floss, strong and won't beak and cleans very well not for small gapped teeth, will get stuck",4
1725,Very convenient to leave the tube on your desk at work to moisturize your hands during the day. Good value for the price.,4
1726,Great product. Seen significant improvement in my skin. Use along with other OZ products.,4
1727,THE PRODUCT DOES NOT WORK AS ORIGINAL...IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY....MISLEADING AND SHOULD BE PULLED!,1
1728,It was too small compared to the same one same brand what I bought from BJs wholesale club.,1

1730,"Horrible, when I received my package it was broken and soaked the box it came in",1
1731,The lipstick was so dry that I could not even apply it without a struggle.  It also was not a flattering color on me.  Very disappointed.,1
1732,I love these. They are perfect for anyone who cuts hair. They are very comfortable and very sharp.,5
1733,2/3 bottles were cracked & leaking when I got it. The cream smells good but did not work like the  Coochy from a Passion Party.,2
1734,Love the product but I wish it had a filter for the tops instead of just being loose.,4
1735,"they would not fit razor sent ,return them  nov 24 2014",1
1736,"Good oil, terrible scent. Did not smell like Lavender at all. I won't be purchasing this one again.",3

1739,Don't preform as advertised. Will be requesting an exchange,1
1740,Great tanning goggles. Love how they are rubber so they don't crack in half like others. Just wish you could pick the color you want.,5
1741,Its too big it doesn't fit on me properly cause it literally falls off my arm.i m not happy with it,2
1742,Seems to be good quality but cracked on me after minimal normal use.,4

1745,This got to me very quickly. Just what I was looking for. Very pleased.,5
1746,I like it but after a short period of time the bird charm fell off.,4
1747,easy to use and clean. lives up to hype except it isn't perfect at keeping beard in excellent trim. safety scissors still helpful.,4
1748,"I like this lotion because it gives a subtle tan to skin, but I do not the shimmer it leaves behind on my skin.",3
1749,I doubt that this is an authentic product because I was sweating like a porcupine in a popcorn tin even in two layers.,1

Sometimes difficult to find really useful products.",5
1751,This product worked twice and then died. I replaced the batteries and it still does not work. Junk.,1
1752,First time trying pearls an I love them they come an all sizes,4
1753,They last forever! I've had one in my safety razor for a few months now and there's barely any rust on it.,5
1754,"So far, no help.  I'll try again.",1
1755,"This product has cleared up the blackheads on my nose really well.  It is pleasant to use, if a bit pricey, but works.",4
1756,Been on for about 7 months. Not much noticeable changes. Will stay with it for a year and see from there.,3
1757,"Just be careful to spray at roots not scalp. Works great on my roots, but if spray at scalp, looks dark on skin.",5

1761,Arrived in great time and is exactly what I needed!,4
1762,works great does not leave as much sticky residue like the pro tape.,3
1763,My husband uses this every day and say's it gives him a closer and cleaner shave.  It also has a nice scent that is not overpowering.,4
1764,Excellent quality for an excellent product at an attractive price.  Very satisfied!,5

1773,I was surprised it make my face feel dryer which I thought mineral make up id the opposite.,4
1774,"i was so excited to get this brushes, the price was okay but the quality is really bad i would not recommend",2
1775,I finally found an instrument that really helps my breathing.  I would recommend this to anyone with sinus problems or dry bedrooms,4

1777,not enough air power to dry and style at once for my hair,3
1778,poor quality and does not go on smooth. the quality of wet and wild has gone way down since the early 90's.,1

1780,I just love this iced tea.  It is refreshing and tastes great.  I drink it every day.,5
1781,I couldn't believe the wonderful pricing on this Waterpik.  It's a high end unit that would have cost considerably more elsewhere.,5
1782,Anchor part is always falling off. Other than that no problems.,2
1783,I have hardly used this and it won't work. Bought in April 2016. I even changed th batterie. Can you send me a replacement?,1

1785,"Failed after 7 days. Very disappointed for 30 some dollars, I guess I will spend more to get a quality item .",1
1786,Great brushes but not to happy that the bottom handle detaches from the brush.,3
1787,The product doesn't stay like in the picture so it doesn't hold the hair properly. Also to clean the plastic after using is very difficult.,1
1788,well not being a man guess it will work haven't tried myself it is a gift.  looks ok,3
1789,Too tight. Think this was intended for kids and needed to say so. But it was adaptable so...ok,3

1791,Big bottle and quality product for the price. Very satisfied with the scent and lather of the product.,5

1793,"Made the purchase of the product
and he did not send",1
1794,Exceptional value for the price. looks nice and will go with lots of outfits and I  can't wait to wear it!,4

1803,Love this product use it all the time at work.,5
1804,"These brushes are fun, girly and reasonably priced. I haven't used them yet, but they seem like they are okay quality.",4
1805,The color was off  from the picture was total different what came. But nice and thick has some coverage.. Better if shading was better,3
1806,I used this product faithfully for several months and saw almost NO difference.  In fact several brown spots have remained the same.  Will not buy again.,1
1807,This product is good.  It actually cover the gray completely.,4
1808,"Seems to record the BP well, easy to use.",4
1809,Gift to our grandson and he loves it. His last date was the school beauty queen. What more could he want?,5
1810,"really feels a bit greasy, like if you put Vaseline on your face",3
1811,Love the style but cheaply made. Wasn't impressed. Really wished my last pair didn't go missing..,2
1812,"I DID NOT LIKE THE ""SHIMMER"" IN THE BLUSH",3
1813,After a couple of uses it started to dry my face out badly,1
1814,It was replaced with a $.10 item.  I will no longer purchcase anything from China because this is the third time I've been ripped off.,1
1815,built like a rock. it will last forever. nice styling and looks good on the vanity,5

1818,The plastic balls tend to break after screwing them on for a few days.,3

1826,"I love all things nautical, so had to get this.",5
1827,"I really like the color and the matte finish.  However, the lipstick always breaks off.",2
1828,"There is nothing better than this, maybe real parsley.",5
1829,Great product but the cost to tube size-expensive. Bigger than sample size but ...,3
1830,This is exactly what I wanted but it is huge. It goes from the top back of my head to my neck.,2
1831,"Great Clay and ""now"" is always a good choice",4
1832,mild scented and ideal for those who do not like the fruity smell of some soaps.  very close to the oil of olay unscented body wash.,5
1833,Love the quantity you get for such a low price.,4
1834,It did what it was supposed to do but did not WOW me.  The price was comparable to the store.,3
1835,Not too keen on this particular fragrance but the soap is what i expected.  Good size and price.  it lasts long too.,3
1836,"worked great for five days and it lost all adhesiveness, really not happy about spending $28.00 on a product that didn't even last!",1
1837,This container keeps all the stones separate and stays closed even when getting tossed around. The color variety is good. Exactly as pictured.,5
1838,There was no way to stick the mustaches on. We used tape. There was also no way of knowing who placed what where.,3
1839,I use it religiously but not a difference. Smells weird and acts weird too. Don't like it.,1
1840,"i have been using it for 4 weeks now, and do see new lashes are growing, must be patient though.",4
1841,Didn't really seem to make an effect on my pores...,2
1842,"I don't care for the scent, annoyed others too when I used it on a recent flight.",4
1843,product came without the safety seal.  I don't like this product as much as other long lasting lipstick,3
1844,I saw Dr. Oz advertise this product on television and decided to try it.  I have not regretted it.  Definitely keeps your skin soft.,5
1845,I love this cream. It smells terrific and isn't greasy.,5
1846,My absolute favorite Blush !! It goes with any skin tone !! Love It !!,5
1847,Very good looking razer and brush holder. Would recommend to a friend.,5

1850,product is good but need some easy way to put in kids finger .,4
1851,It worked great at a baby shower! There is a little bit of prep work to complete though.,4
1852,very small can't wrap it 2 times more for a child.,1
1853,Kinda cheap looking packaging. But it will do for one ocassion,3
1854,I tried it but it was a bit heavy.  I usually buy the lotion which is lighter to apply.,3
1855,"Leaves hair feeling a little sticky, but does the job and has a great hold",4
1856,Works very well! Covered my roots  all day without being overly heavy or sticky. I will buy this again.,5

1869,They do what razor blades are supposed to do.  They are packaged in multiple lightweight cardboard boxes inside a larger package.  They work fine for shaving.,4
1870,I have been using for a month and no results yet.,2
1871,"It's a good shaver; however, it tends to leave my husband with a lot of ingrown hairs.",4
1872,Cute gir the price!! Only a couple time wear due to the cheap metal,3
1873,This product is wonderful it actually holds and locks in my makeup all day. It last for hours even through this hot Florida weather.,5

1895,doesn't seem to clean as well as facial scrubs. Does have a refreshing sent and feel/,3

1898,"Smells incredible...almost a musk, deep scent. Lathers very well. You feel clean all day!",5

1905,Is basically a sheath of mesh.  Soap will not stay in it.  No way to close off the end.  Just a cheap loofah.,1
1906,For safety razor as advertised. Close shave. Wipp buy again when needed,5
1907,I like the hot air brush however there seems to be a trick to not getting it stuck. I'm hoping practice will prevail. ;),4
1908,One of the bars came smashed at the top making the design not attractive.  Not well packed.,3

1923,"used it ONCE and now it won't work. Cleaned it, changed batteries, nothing. Not happy.",1

1939,Much less razor burn than other brands. I will buy again when I run out in like 5 years,5
1940,I like 3 of the bridges in the set and the price was great recommended!,4
1941,From the picture I thought it would be light but when I got the chain it's heavy...it's wearable but it could be lighter,3

1954,good product helps with smooth shaving without a strong odor.,4
1955,Seems to me it is a little thinner than when I bought it in the store.  Definitely too expensive.,4

1957,"my wife loved it ,and thanked me ,she gets good coments all the time.",5
1958,"Fits perfectly with my brush from the Art of Shaving and my Double Edge Safety razor from Merkur. Very solid stand, too!",5
1959,Junk. Don't bother wasting your money. If I could give zero stars I would. Does not work.,1
1960,I have had no other pick but am very satisfied with this one that my dentist insisted that I purchase.,4

1969,"Smells good! And i get tons of compliments on it, not sure if it attracts people but its a great scent.",4
1970,It works as described on the brochure and totally serves the purpose. Only had to use one of the tool heads,4
1971,Not as effective for removing make up as id hoped. Wipes are too dry.,2
1972,Don't see a a difference. Been using for a couple weeks now.,3
1973,"While in theory, this is wonderful stand for the brush, it does not work for the razor.. which keeps sliding out of its holder.",2

1976,This product is a rip-off -- just cheap plastic crap.,1

1979,I find the smell to strong for me... almost like a tar odor. I was disappointed. But dR. Oz said Neem is good.,2

1987,I love the Essie nail polish now I like this product to smells good and goes on well no mes,4

1989,"It's good, but, I found one better.",4

2014,This is my second waterpik. It tends to last a little more then 3 years with two people using it daily. Its worth the cost.,4
2015,This is a wonderful shaver. The purchase price was a good deal. The Norelco holds up well. The heads are easy to replace.,5
2016,Kind of cool but need to advertise that this is REALLY REALLY SMALL,3

2115,This brush is very comfortable to use.  I am not sure how long it will last. I have only had it for two months.,5

2126,"This is a great product but if your man has tough beards, doesn't work as well. Yes I would still recommend it ..",4
2127,Every color is clear with sparkles. I didn't realize it wasn't a powder makeup.,1
2128,Didn't get lice at school so I assume it works!,5
2129,"SELLER FANTASTIC, fast, easy, future excellence expected. Product is not: gloppy &takes a good deal of pressure to apply.",2
2130,"As usual,  this bath gel was just as good as expected.",5
2131,It was broke when it arrived so I didn't get to use it,1
2132,I'm post-chemo.  Two doses did not work for me.,1
2133,A little thick between the toes but gets the job done.,4
2134,I have used this product for many years and it is the best conditioner that I have ever tried and I have tried many!,4
2135,Unable to get at my salon and was happy to see that I could still get this wonderful bronzer.,5
2136,"I really like Zum products and this is very good soap, smells good, and cleans well.",4
2137,"Most of the rinstones were out of the Rings, by the time I got them.",1
2138,"The item was a little smaller than I thought it would be, but it works great. Will last through the night.",3
2139,Would be 5 but when it arrived the lid was cracked and I need to be waxed before my trip so I guess it is what it is.,4
2140,"Did not dry hair at all, just dried out the ends. Returned it.",1
2141,At least one of these items I ordered (Patchouli) was something I can say smelt like Patchouli and was nice on the skin.,4
2142,"SO, I tried this and found relief for a day and that was all.  Maybe it will work for others, I sure hope so.",3
2143,"I very much like the warmer, but the wax is just rotten. Plus it doesn't come with the wax-off which is sorely needed with it!",3
2144,Completely broken when I received this! I'm so upset paying money for something that I can't use! Will be returning.,1
2145,"Great product,service, and fast shipping thank you.",5
2146,This is a good soap. I have been using it for a year and wouldn't change it. Good price too,4
2147,This is the BEST smelling body wash ever!  Love it.,5
2148,"Really bummed about this product, this doesnt smell good, and has a very thin consistency. Horrible stay away from",1
2149,I was hoping for something that would reduce the smell of the chlorine. I would not buy it again and stick with Nivea.,2
2150,A reliable blade that holds an edge well. Is a sharp but forgiving blade. Great blade for beginners.,4
2151,"They are tanning goggles, they do their job, they make me look like a bug while protecting my eyes.  I have no complaints.",4
2152,"A cute necklace but when it first came in the mail, the piece in the stomach fell off of it.  Had to hot glue it back.",3
2153,Received my pods yesterday so shocked how quick I received wish they were pink but I knew it said random but thank you,5
2154,Not sharp enough to cut nails at all. Don't waste your money,1
2155,"Don't like the smell, but I like the product.",3
2156,Using for 3 weeks have not seen changes. Feels like good moisturizer,3
2157,Gorgeous color and super easy to apply. Only con is that it comes off easily. I plan on buying more and in different colors!,4
2158,Supposedly this damages ur teeth n makes them look invisible bUT I used them twice n it worked,5
2159,"Doesn't prevent sweat as much as the chocolate powder, but it smells good and taste great. I'd definitely buy more",4
2160,If I could give it no stars that's what it would have none! Don't waste your money on this product,1
2161,I AM NOT HAPPY WITH THIS SHAVER AND I PLAN ON RETURNING IT WITHIN THE 45 DAY TRIAL PERIOD.,1
2162,Love Andalou naturals.  I have tried a lot of the different lines.  The only things that don't really work for me are the creams.,4
2163,Not really for my hair.  Thick and course.  Did not help bringing out the silver.,2
2164,I just see this product works so so not like what I image!,3
2165,It is beautiful and exactly what I was hoping for!!,5
2166,"is a product of excellent quality and very good price. I'm fascinated with the acquisition, efeito my child's hair very well!",5

2168,"This just doesn't stay on well, and I have to keep adjusting it.  Don't buy...",2

2170,"Not the greatest product, do not see much difference after use.",3
2171,"I love this lotion, but I thought I was purchasing a 2 pack but I only received 1 jar of lotion.",3
2172,Bought this to use on my shorkie and the color is extremely light. Barley showed up on her white/blonde head.,1
2173,This is great.  I've used this for years now and always good dentists visits.,5
2174,"I just received this at the beginning of November, and it's already not working properly. Definitely go with a different brand.",2
2175,Good product I would recommend getting two so you don't put a lot of wear on one,4
2176,Helps me keep my teeth clean. The floss smells like mint and does not shred during flossing. I recommend it.,5
2177,"Used as directed, I didn't notice any change after using the entire contents.",2
2178,"The product did not perform according to the listed Vitamin C, E and A; no difference in skin appearance nor feel.",2
2179,Being an older woman I don't care for bold colors. This adds just the right amount of matte color I need.,5
2180,these make my life easier when I do my nails. fast shipping and good product,5
2181,Too small. Doesn't come across as pretty as I was hoping,3
2182,What I received looks nothing like the picture. It's poorly made and very small. Not happy with it.,2
2183,Doesn't feel good at all.  No support either.,1
2184,"Pretty good brushes for the price, and the face ones are my faves!",4
2185,didn't notice any real difference in my skin or improvement,3
2186,makes my face break out. In my fifties and getting pimples. it blocks my pores. If I had dry skin would probably be OK,3
2187,I simply love the color!  It goes on smoothly and keeps my lips moist.  Good product for a reasonable cost.,5
2188,not sure if they're from old lots but all four of them were drier than normal and the deodorant kept breaking off in chunks.,2
2189,"Doesn't smell too bad, but definitely did not work to keep my lice prone 3rd grader from getting it repeatedly.",2
2190,"High quality trimmer, compared to a few other brands I have tried that are made for women.",4
2191,I am still trying to get used to it.  takes practice.............looks great!!,5
2192,"Nice.  Not very noisy.
The design can be made better by placing the on-off switch at an easier place.
But not a big deal.",4
2193,Very cute but the carrage wheels are not attached. But nice anyway.,3
2194,I love these lipstcks and they do last but I end up eating them off lol,4
2195,I can NOT get this diffuser open.  It looks so pretty but I have tried everything and it won't turn or pull off= ugh!!!,2
2196,"difficult to remove backing to expose sticky and does not stay in place, bunches up. Was not happy with it.",3
2197,LOVED IT AND WORE IT FOR A WEEK AND IT BROKE.,1

2199,"I have always been a fan of scope, but I wished it was a little stronger and lasted fresh longer.",4
2200,Item is exactly what I expected.  This is the second one that I have purchased.  Works fine and I also liked the price.,4
2201,Great high quality comb that is perfect for bringing along in my pocket.,5
2202,if you want to have a clean niece teeth you cannot miss that product. highly recomendation,5
2203,"Came with a massive hole in it. I'm so unimpressed, and quite frankly, I'm very angry.",1
2204,This is an incredible machine. I use it DAILY since 2011 and performs as well as new. It helped me a lot with my orthodontic treatment.,5
2205,It wears off pretty quickly unfortunately. I've had much better lipstick sealers.,3
2206,"I speck,to feel something,not a feeling that's on,if is for pain,didn't do anything.",1
2207,Used the entire tube as instructed. Gums still bleeding. A waste of $10.,1
2208,the booties were a joke! spend the extra $....this product is inferior!,2
2209,"I didn't order 2..but I was charged for 2. Not cool, not happy, more work for me.",1
2210,Helping with the tone of my skin and lightening the dark circles under my eyes.,4
2211,"Feather is a little floppy, but it's good for the price and I will definitely get at least another wear out of it.",4
2212,This works as well as some expensive Alums I have used and I would order it again and again.,4
2213,I can't get the top off of this product.,1
2214,"They are what was needed, at the right price.",4
2215,"This is very pretty. My daughter loved it. However, it was not as sturdy/well made as I expected for the price.",3
2216,My daughter loves her tooth brush. Really nice price as well.,4
2217,Bad quality........like very bad! Feels like brushing your face with plastic brushes,1
2218,"Look like a natural tan, nice color and it doesn't look caked on",5
2219,Love my new Mad Hippie face cream and the eye cream is great as well. Looking to try the serum next!!,5
2220,My facial skin is noticeably softer in less than a week. Pretty nice!,4
2221,I did receive 2 different colored brushes. One red and one blue. They are both the same size being for 7-10  years old.,5
2222,"All dlcs and borderlands games for just 19$ (22$ with taxes) its incredible, i was waiting for this so long :)",5
2223,"As good as expected I'd say..
If it was any better it'd be perfect",4
2224,It's an adhesive for holding stuff to your body that doesn't work if you sweat. It decidedly does not stay.,2
2225,Functions more like a drying rack for my razer. No brush yet but the option is always there.,4
2226,The tooth polish was dryed out had to throw it away wasn't happy,1
2227,"Pretty good stuff. Smells rather ""earthy"" in my opinion. The scent seems to last for a bit in my diffuser after using it.",4
2228,Makes for a good shave. I use it with my Viking safety razor.,5
2229,This cap sheds a little. I wake up and my pillow has tiny black fibers on it. Other satin caps I've had have not shed.,3
2230,Disappointed somewhat. It has one faint scent I can't place but it just doesn't belong.,3
2231,this oil is very smooth on the skin.  Light and absorbs well.  Not greasy.,4
2232,Very cheap product. Smears all over your nails and does not look good.,1
2233,Works great. My daughter uses it to learn theatrical makeup techniques,5
2234,"got 4 total, help keep my toe from hurting from all my walking",5
2235,"Great product, lasts all day and goes on nice and smooth.",5
2236,"I use it every day, and had used it for several years, still is working good. I love the design and it is reliable.",5
2237,Works quite well with my Braun Series 7 Pulsonic Shaver. Definitely reduces shaver 'drag' and doesn't contaminate the Braun Series 7 alcohol-based cleaning solution.,4
2238,"EXCELLENT PRODUCT, GOOD PRICE, SUPER FAST SHIPPING THANKS AGAIN",5
2239,great trimmer. only downside it does not have a stand or stand on its own as my last one did,4
2240,Smells great and isn't heavy to put on :),4
2241,"They should have came with instructions. Not very impressed with the product , its quite uncomfortable.",2
2242,Light and easy to use. Great for the price I paid. Would have like stringer blades though for tough beards,4
2243,"the colors are gorgeous, but beware - it is VERY pigmented. Use with a light hand!",4
2244,"The tracking info was conflicting, but it came and feels nice to the touch. I'll update when I see what it does for my skin.",4
2245,Works good with long hair.  It is hard to find a barrette for heavy hair.,4
2246,"love this bubble bath,love all avon bubble bath,lathers great and smells great",5
2247,"Liked alot the first box I ordered, next box though, it did not pull off near as much hair. Not consistent.",3
2248,Cute arrived on time but is not sterling silver as advertised?,1
2249,Very disappointed. Got 3 pinks 2 silver and a blue? Why wouldn't you give more varied colors.,1
2250,It says pack of two but I didn't not receive two I only got one,2
2251,Really not necessary. I'll use it but not reorder it.,3
2252,I kinda expected more for $2 but it's cool they look real but break easily,3
2253,Always the best for my daughters curly hair.  Nothing works this great.,5
2254,It's a comb. I barely can feel it against my skin. I like the smell.,4
2255,It's alright but it does not get a good close shave at all. This is only for trimming with the comb.,3
2256,Read the other Mavala review I wrote. In short - stuff works but you have to coat every finger or both hands.,5
2257,"Trims well.  Plasticky, would rather fewer piece of higher quality, but it gets the job done.",4
2258,Love this brush set it was one of my first little set. I would recommend,5
2259,"Heavy, good looking, performs it's function well. Fast delivery.",5
2260,"It used to work better when it had the other presentation, see trhough bottle with bownish gel.....now is not as good...that's all.",3
2261,"Keeps nylon socks up , roll on makes it easy.",5
2262,Really want exciting to get this after reading some of the reviews. The color made my skin tone look pale and I usually love nudes.,2
2263,Transaction went smoothly and timely. It's very hard to find this product where I live so it's good to know where I can buy it.,4
2264,I purchased two and have received compliments on them .... we love it!,5
2265,It did not look like the picture. It was also like used.,1
2266,"The earrings are gorgeous but one, was broken when I receive them.",1
2267,"What can i say - they keep me from burning my corneas. That's all I could ask for! They fit great, and are comfortable.",4
2268,"I tried running with them, I think they made me run faster",5
2269,"Didnt thought this was gonna work that well, is amazing how good this is and how fast it works.",5
2270,"Really bad , nothing grows??????",1
2271,This is just what the dentist ordered! I am delighted with how fresh and clean my mouth and teeth feel after using it.,5
2272,Frangrance was too much for me and caused headaches. Had to give it away.,2
2273,Love these! percect size and shape I wear them al the time!,4
2274,"Great product,  fast shipping,  comfortable and leaves only finger tips out. My clients love them",5
2275,I liked everything about the product except the shaver it was pointless it didn't work properly but everything else was exceptional,4
2276,This thing sure beats traditional flossing which takes forever and is a pain in the neck. Much easier and maybe more effective.,4
2277,It's great for taping your strapless dress to you to help keep it up,4
2278,Not crazy about it. Don't like how it feels on my face.,5
2279,Nice little unit. Don't need all the extra attachments but am sure that other users would find them useful. Priced right.,4
2280,Vegan hands-down the best product Ive ever used in my life absolutely plant-based 100% ecstatic with this product I will continue to buy it forever,5
2281,Started pitting in less than 30 days.  Returned it for another one.,1
2282,"Plenty of water, quieter, good pressure, small footprint. One tip is all it is needed. Would recommend to all my friends and relatives",5
2283,"They aren't the best quality, but, hey they're a great deal for the price!",5
2284,Very happy with my first time using it my hair was manageable,4
2285,"I love these things, they work real good at getting all the grime off.",5
2286,Not worth the price.  Other products at Sally's beauty supply that are better quality and priced better,1
2287,This does not work. Just an FYI. I didn't see a difference at all,1
2288,"Didn't care for this it used to much to lather, had a weird smell and I could get better from WallMart.",2
2289,The waterpik is great for cleaning out left over food from your gums after brushing and flossing even though you think you did a good job.,5
2290,"Im using it to my baby all the time.
Its good for diaper rash,dry skin,newborn rash...",5
2291,"It definitely keeps you dry, but the size and the price make it impossible to defend purchasing regularly.",2
2292,"nice looking. only problem is that the fusion does not fit perfectly into the holder, but that is o k.",4
2293,"Great blades. Used with Art of Shaving Pre-Shave oil and AOS Cream for a close smooth shave,",4
2294,One broke the first time I tried to use it.,3
2295,"You will get what you see on the picture, but pretty cheap quality. It arrived much faster than the estimated delivery time.",4
2296,"The gloves arrived when stated. Fit is a little big, but manageable. I have petitie hands so I expected them to be a little big",4
2297,I also bought this for my niece because she likes owlsand it would compliment the Life Tree bracelet that I bought.,3
2298,Did not see to much of a difference after I used it,2
2299,This product didn't do anything for me.  Not sure why or if I'm mistaken.,3
2300,"pen constantly slips out of cap, preventing me from keeping pens on the key ring. more of a pocket pen than anything.",2
2301,didnt like this or felt like it was helping at all,2
2302,"The consistency of the product was too thin for my 4C hair.  Not a bad product, but not suited for my hair type.",3
2303,Good coverage but will only use it as a concealer. NOT full face foundation friendly.,4
2304,It's too light! I have to layer it up to make the color show. Ugh.,3
2305,"It's not water proof, but it does exactly what it needs to do. Great product for the price!",5
2306,"works well as an antiperspirant, but it crumbles when the stick is close to exhausted.",3
2307,"Causes Awful breakouts. I am not one to have a lot of pimples, but this cream destroyed my skin.",1
2308,The product came just as what I'd expected. I have had two Philips' Norelco models before and have been happy with their product.,4
2309,This is a wonderful product. Your skin really does feel tighter. I will buy this product again.,4
2310,I liked the  many colors offered. Winter and summer selections.,4
2311,Took over a month to get And doesn't fit well.,1
2312,Color not as expected but that happens most of the time!,4
2313,"It gets rid of hard to get at junk in your mouth, it has a large resevior, it is a bit messy though",4
2314,Can't review as I found out I am allergy to it. I have super sensitive skin.,2
2315,"I am using this product for some time, but don't see any improvements.",1
2316,"I sent an adulterated perfume, water and alcohol, odorless, they supposed to be an original perfume, that is of poor quality",1
2317,good will take few weeks to know if it works.,4
2318,This Cleaner that i got was 100% fake. All they did is use rubbing alcohol. It was horrible. NEVER AGAIN !!!,1
2319,Use it with my girlfriend and it doesn't work. It's a waste of money. Will never buy this item again!!!,1
2320,"Does what it is supposed to do simply and well and inexpensively.
Looks great.
Fast, fast delivery",5
2321,After only a couple uses the barrel disconnected from the handle and moved freely around.  Basically a waste of money,1
2322,I was really excited to go no poo but this bar just left my oily hair very greasy and waxy. I was very disappointed.,1
2323,theyre allright....they don't pick up as much of the makeup and i would like but what can you expect,3
2324,"Dreadful, screen tore 3 x after replacement withing several weeks.
Cheaply made , plastic, and  poor fitting parts.
Never again",1
2325,"Has issues with the 1st one priming.  Now the replacement is doing it.  It works, but not as easy as we wanted.",3
2326,Great as always.  Just wish it weren't an add-on.,5
2327,I love this water flossed.  It works great my husband hates to floss and would never do it but he will use this.,5
2328,"Great for pubes, works nice without pulling or not trimming. I like it,  only wished it was rechargeable or waterproof,  but that would cost more",5
2329,These are the worst.  I used them only a couple of times and the screw came out which holds the scissors together.,1
2330,I didn't like these labels because when I actually saw them I knew they were too small for me to write on.,2
2331,"It has a nice texture- lightweight and good smell. However, I really did not notice any difference after using it.",3
2332,Find these to be prone to rusting moreso than Merkur or Feather.,2
2333,"The item is fine, my husband did not adapt well to using it.  One of my kids is using it with great success.",3
2334,"It's ok, still leaves back some hair, not a clean shave, but my hubby likes it",3
2335,Easy to use and great color....will continue to use.,4
2336,They work good. The picture shows 4. Only 1 was delivered. They are trying to show color choices in the picture. Disappointed.,2
2337,"The color is pretty, it doesnt stay on as long as I would like and it is flat, not glossy.",4
2338,Shampoo was delivered in a timely manner and well packed.  I like the way it cleans my hair and will order more when this runs out.,4
2339,Received the product within a couple weeks and it looks exactly as stated. Haven't used the product yet but will be soon.,4
2340,"Ok pair of gloves, wear out a little to fast though",3
2341,The WP-60W is just as powerful and works just as well.  That holds more water and requires fewer refilling.,4
2342,Would not purchase again. Did not smell like lavender. Terrible smell.,1
2343,Too thin. It would be better if it were a bit thicker.,3
2344,I like this product a lot....it really works well.,4
2345,This tape breaks during usage very easily.  It usually takes 2 to 4 quantities to do my mouth. I will not buy again.,2
2346,"I will like to stat longer in my face, colors are asewome",4
2347,Came with 2ea of ten different colors. Exactly what I was advertised and expecting.,5
2348,This was a waste of money.  It did not do what is it supposed to do and it smalled like Garlic.  Who would want that?,1
2349,Sucks! will never purchase again. Hurt trying to place into nose and made my ears itch.,1
2350,did not come up to expectation. very weak aroma.,1
2351,This is a great cleaner for the Braun electric razor.  Bought at a good price.  And was shipped for safe delivery.,5
2352,Great soap.  Love the smell and will purchase again.  3 bars come packaged together.,4
2353,This is what I have used for more than 20 years to shape my stubborn thick hair.  I am so glad this is still available!,5
2354,Did not work for my thick tight curly hair.  It left it dry and so much shrinkage.  Maybe for someone with looser and longer curls.,2
2355,Product is like spray paint... yes it is textured buy looks very unnatural... makes your hair look matted and looses normal luster of natural hair...,1
2356,It's cheap which I should have expected. And broke within a few days. Not worth the low amount of money I paid.,1
2357,Love this scent. The heart charm looks a little cheap. Great scent to wear in the evening.,4
2358,Great find.  East to use under bridge.  Very good for travel.,5
2359,Really pure. Simple packaging. Generous amount. Great value.,4
2360,"This is a very small beauty blender. It does the job, however it is fairly small.",2
2361,The color is supposed to be great on light fair skin. Its so pale and hardly shows up. Not the same as in the picture.,1
2362,For adult the hair band is too small (or I have big head :-)) but it is nice and met the expectation.,3
2363,Nothing exciting....was expecting more peeling and smoothness - nothing like that happened.,3
2364,Makes you extremely sticky. Does not moisturize. My legs still have scales from being dried out from the pool. Citrusy scent is unisex.,1
2365,These brushes are very good. I'm very happy with this product,5
2366,"Is small and powerful and quiet. Besides, it has a number of tips that fulfill mostr of your cleaning requirements",5
2367,I love this shampoo and it makes my hair feel great.  I will be ordering this again.,5
2368,Love the tea tree oil and all the benefits.  Kind of expensive.,4
2369,I haven't seen any changes yet but I will continue to use. Very light and tube is small enough to carry.,3
2370,"Very sharp, I have been using these for years. I have tried other but always come back to Astra. Great value, great quality.",4
2371,Oily skin persons beware! This product has a few irritants that can cause acne issues.,3
2372,Good follow up to brushing and flossing. Really irrigates gum line and great for flushing under bridges and around crowns,4
2373,The blades seem to be the same as they were many years ago.  Just fine.,4
2374,This did not work on my daughter's hair to detangle it.,1
2375,Not impressed with the lotion for my face. For the body it's fine.,1
2376,"Smells good enough.  Not my favorite incense.  But hey, it covers up the smell of some other smoke.",3
2377,I love this!!! The bottle is so cute and the scent is a very nice fruity-floral one with a bit of musk.,4
2378,"Its nice in a pinch, but I prefer a lotion sunblock.  This doesnt rub in as well and stays kind of sticky IMO.",3
2379,Great smell and hair feels so soft. Hopefully will keep lice away!,5
2380,had one of these b4 doesn't seem to shave as close as other other one did. maybe i'll try the swivel head next time,3
2381,Yes! They help with puffiness and help to keep my eyes not looking tired! They feel amazing!,5
2382,These are sparkly and pretty. Also appear to be of good quality.,4
2383,The product that arrived was not the was pictured and what was advertised. Rather than getting the semi-permanent color I received the permanent color.,1
2384,Holds very good. Would not recommend if you're hair is very long.,4
2385,This product is definitely a dud! I really wish I could get all of my money back.. waste of time and money,5
2386,Fake. These are not the real ones. These are fake. Do not work. Do not buy.,1
2387,Very Sharp. Nice scissors. Very small finger holes.,4
2388,The soap gets a bit mushy. I go through one of these quickly compared to other soaps but I dig the ingredients.,4
2389,"Much easier on the skin than regular shavers
The only con is that after a while the battery life sucks and can't get you through the job.",4
2390,Just don't love the smell.. and it leaves a slippery slime in the shower.,2
2391,after about a year the switch failed on mine - it wouldn't shut off - I was disappointed,3
2392,I give it a 4 star because they come off if you sweat but if your not sweating they make a big difference,4
2393,In Oil Control Face Powders Cover Girl Products is the best.,5
2394,Hard to match - not happy as it does not cover as well as stated,3
2395,never saw a bit of difference so did not order again for all the reviews i read i was hopefull,2
2396,Good colors and it works well with the nail stamping kit I purchased too.,4
2397,"This argan oil is the best I have bought,it leaves my frizzy hair soft and shiny.",5
2398,not bad but no better or worse than any other weave glue,3
2399,Really glad I finally bought one and this one works form me,5
2400,No black or white but great array all the same.  Much cheaper than buying thread colors separately.,4
2401,Great as a mild peel.  Not too irritating and definitely leaves skin bright and smooth.,5
2402,An excellent product. Worth every penny. You'll be glad you made this purchase.,5
2403,"I love it,but my daughter doesn't use it everyday",5
2404,"great to double up with a durag, don't like the boo boo stitching though",4
2405,this product didn't work at all. My arms still looked the same plus the wrap didn't fix. This product was the waste of money,1
2406,I always fill it up with 70% ethanol and it works very well so I don't have to buy it everytime,1
2407,"Provides a great base for other make up and controls oil well, but does not have enough tint to be used on its own",4
2408,"product is good..It does what it promises... no complaints.

I would buy it again..... Only thing is the water container is a little bit small",4
2409,the product was time consuming and did not work! I would not buy this product again. False adverstisement for this product.,1
2410,"They worked well.  They didn't fit me the best, but that's not necessarily the fault of the manufacturer.",4
2411,Attractive necklace. I do not smell the essential oils unless I lift it to my nose. It is handy to have them close and handy,3
2412,"I didn't even expect it to be this good. Simple, easy to use... Just perfect!!!",4
2413,I love this brand . My skin feels super smooth and it's not greasy . I will be purchasing more from this brand,4

2415,This crap don't work!!!! Tried for a wig and no stick at all garbage and you can't return it ugh,1
2416,"It is very good buy, just bought it yesterday my wife started using it and she loves it.",4
2417,The diamonds fall out super easy. Definitely dissatisfied and won't buy again.,1
2418,Has a very solid base and securely holds my safety razor blade. Plus the chrome finish looks cool!,5
2419,Shipped super fast and I love that it's all natural. Great product :),5
2420,Husband's favorite and they're really getting expensive in all the stores.,5
2421,Described perfectly. Extremely fast shipping. Couldn't be happier.,5
2422,These are nice razors. They come in smaller packs of 5 inside so they are easy to divide up or put where you need to.,5
2423,This Item is just what I needed. It's the perfect size for my razor and brush.,4
2424,Sometimes requires suction to start the flow of water through the tube,3
2425,It's a great natural nude color however the applicator makes it hard to apply to the lips.,4
2426,This is not as compact and light as I'd hoped.,2
2427,This is a lovely moisturizer...nice scent and makes my skin very soft.,4
2428,Have used Goldleaf for a number of years.  Love it.,5
2429,Exceeded my expectations will order again!!!!!!,4
2430,They work well but they aren't comfortable.  On the other hand I have no basis for comparison as I've never tried another kind.,3
2431,"Not quite what I expected, but not bad either. I believe they should be sharper. On the very good side they came with a great case",4
2432,"I love this hairspray,  its just what i was looking for.  the new formula is more expensive,  and this one is better",5
2433,"These don't work well for removing eye makeup, you have to harshly rub. Coconut oil works 10x better.",2
2434,Best coverage ever! Will never buy any other foundation!,5
2435,"You're better off with nothing on.

I'm going back to my roll-on aloe vera deodorant.",1
2436,"Works great between color, so simple to use and buys me a few extra days.",5

2438,Decent quality and nice color choices for price.  Would recommend.,5
2439,Smells Great  It doesn't seem to last to long though.,4
2440,"I really like the product. It removes particles that brushing misses. Of course it does not completely replace flossing, but pretty darn close.",4
2441,"Great for a beginner like me, not to sharp to cut up my face but sharp enough to do the job.",4
2442,I was disappointed in this product because it was in a plastic bottle and seemed to be a knock off,2
2443,A tight fit even for a 7 year old but the braid part is wonderful,4
2444,"Great rings. 2 arrived with the gym missing. Had to super glue back in. Other than that, great product!",3
2445,Cost is good. Husband has been using it for years.,5
2446,"not good, i did not know it had other things in it. Very HARD to remove from hair. Had to use Dawn and baking soda",1
2447,Its exactly what I wanted. I am very happy with it. You can't beat the price of this adorable nail accesory,4
2448,Very prety and great for keeping my shoulder-length curly hair in place sylishly.,5
2449,"Jewelry needs to be bigger size,  its very small other then that its good",4
2450,"My kid smells like a citronella candle with this, but it's kept the lice off!",5
2451,I do not enjoy wearing this item.  It is a very good idea.,2
2452,I wanted the pix that are like a serrated knife and these weren't.,3
2453,A couple of my belly button rings didn't have balls on them,2
2454,Its ok. I mean just ok. It makes you feel really clean but it also makes your face hurt when its drying.,3
2455,Did not whiten my teeth but my breathe was refresshing.,3
2456,"This tea is very strong.  I really dislike the taste.  If you like sage and can bare the taste, by all means, buy it.",2

2458,"Lovely scent, gorgeous color <3
Lips get a little dry after.",4
2459,"I love pink Spiky Edge gatsby.
It works wonder with short or medium-long hair.
I recommend to all, but especially to Asians.",5
2460,You get what you pay for. These do what they are meant to do.,3
2461,This stuff smells disgusting. Does not lather. Don't waste your time or money. .,1
2462,Bought as a gift so I can't say how they worked but do be aware they don't come in a box. They are just loose.,4
2463,It does the job but for some reason this latest bottle seems to be more diluted than the past 2 others I've used.,3
2464,Does as described but more scratchy then over brands which I prefer.,3
2465,"Not working for me, but it might work for someone else and I know it did for a few people I know.",3
2466,Smells nice but I don't know if it really did the job repelling bugs,3
2467,Does not lather well and have not noticed a difference in my hair,3
2468,"Purchased as a gift, this cover fills the bill for tablet protection and utility. The quality is quite good for the price.",4
2469,Nothing special. Not impressed. Waste of money on this one scent is not memorable nor lasting.,2
2470,Have used about three times. Appears to add some volume.,4
2471,Fit easily on wider glasses.  The polarization is excellent.,5
2472,"I got this tonight, one day early. I was pleased. This oil is hot massage oil very good for healing the body.",5
2473,I got mine fast actialli but they do not glow in the dark ,3
2474,Bought it for a gift for someone.  They love it. Received it right away. She is happy with the gift.,5
2475,Just what I needed.  I have been looking for these for quite some time. Thanks!,4
2476,"When I received this item, it already seemed old and had an unpleasant odor.  Had to throw it out.",2
2477,"For the price, I should have guessed it was going  to be so big and gaudy. Wish I looked at the details a little longer...",1
2478,Husband loves it.... Uses it to wash his locs,5
2479,It is the just right RED. I love it. You will have sweet lips,4
2480,I like this product however my pump is defective and I have to unscrew it every time in order to get some out to use. Lame.,3
2481,Can't tell ur wearing  it.  Doesn't really show up,1
2482,"Nice , but neck is big. Would not use on someone with a small neck.",4
2483,Too difficult to get used to and I still haven't. Price is good if you need to help fill a trash pail.,1
2484,Very Sticky. Can get caught on itself. Doesn't hold well.,2
2485,I returned this item. I purchased thinking this was a regular sized brush. But it is a miniture sized for travel.....,1
2486,"I purchased this,
Assuming it was German made.
Not so, made in China!
I would not have spent my money, had I known that",3
2487,"Threw them right away. Don't even cut, just mangle your nails",1
2488,"It was not skilled at using it...so quit after a few tries.
J.",3
2489,"The rechargeable battery is worthless, although the clipper does work when it is plugged in. Ceramic cutters are wonderful with no oiling required.",3
2490,If you are looking to buy a bunch of this on Amazon you must already use it and like it.,4
2491,works great on the guys now that I cut hair clippers for them.  This is really helpful to keep the hair off.,5
2492,Great shave. I wish the regular price was a little lower and I didn't have to look for coupons to 'clip' on Amazon!,4
2493,Gloves fit good for my small hands and very fast fast delivery.,5
2494,All products were perfect except the door bin.  The bin arrived broke. It's a shame because it did fit great..,5
2495,Just stopped working. Lasted two years. Just FYI.,2
2496,"They don't last very long but for the price, its okay ... i use for my young living essential oils.",3
2497,This product was too harsh for my face so I am not using it.,1
2498,"it takes a little time to get used to, but it delivers what promised!",4
2499,I used the product to make a body lotion and it worked perfectly!,5
2500,The fragrance is definitely fake..... last only 15-20 minutes.,1
2501,"Favourite products for natural hair, leaves it soft, healthy and curly",4
2502,Good but expensive than Wal-Mart price(product + shipping),3
2503,Phew! not sure if it works since I only used it once. Very strong odor for my liking...,1
2504,Dental floss tears and is difficult to handle -- dental tape (waxed) does a great job and daily flossing is great for gum health.,5
2505,"I like it, moisturizing and feels nice. Color doesn't last too long though.",4
2506,"would prefer the spray function to be aerosol, but...",4
2507,They don't stay sharp even when cleaning and drying immediately after use - other brands I can make a razor last 3 months. These last days,2
2508,"Stand looks great. Highly polished, appears to be well made. Great addition to my bathroom counter.",5
2509,It was the perfect size. I wanted to test the product first before purchasing a larger bottle.  And this product was exactly what I hoped for.,4
2510,It's poorly made and the material doesn't live up to the expectation.,1
2511,"HEAVY WITH A STRIKING LOOK. HOWEVER, DIDN'T ACCOMMODATE MY HUSBAND'S MUHLE RYTMO RAZOR OR MUHLE MEDIUM FINE 21MM KNOT DIAMETER BADGER BRUSH.",4
2512,Can't honestly say it does anything for my hair one way or the other.,3
2513,Trash. It is expensive for a centimeter of a strip. Literally a centimeter long,1
2514,good product.  i can't say I noticed much whitening in my teeth.  It was good as a mouth wash and is not too intense.,4
2515,As advertised. Fits perfect for a Merkur 34C and an Art of Shave Brush,4
2516,"I bought this to replace my Remington Titanium trimmer and I couldn't be happier.

It has all the attachments I need.",5
2517,"When I opened my box, the bottle had soap dried all on it.  It looked like someone had used it and returned it.",1
2518,"I would have given it a 4 1/2 but the bar didn't seem to last very long.  Otherwise, I liked it.",4
2519,"A bit dark for me, but would probably be Perfect for someone more bold.  BE CAREFUL when applying, you need to pay attention!",3
2520,too shallow to whip up a good lather.  I am repurposing it as a salt bowl.,2
2521,"Very handy for toenail, not so sure for fingernails.",4
2522,"We like this stuff for very dry, cracked fingertips. My husband and I have use this all winter long.",5
2523,"Smells great, didn't last long.  About a week and a half and the whole bar was gone.",4
2524,Weak....overall it does the job but I found it weak.,2
2525,very good grips im impressed they came very fast and were good heavy quality helped reduce vibration and machine topheavyness  will get many more for all my machines,5
2526,"Works awesome! Non-drying, clears pores and makes them smaller. Plus, I never have to exfoliate anymore.",5
2527,This exfoliation makes a visible difference to your skin in just one use. Visibly refines pores and smoothes skins texture. A little goes a long way!,5
2528,I thought this floss would be thicker. I'm going back to glide after i use this one all up,3
2529,Nice fragrance.  Nice quality.  Not greasy but moisturizing.,4
2530,I was quite pleased with it... easy to put on and stayed tight all night.,5
2531,"the color is very pretty, but not for ppl with dry & chapped lips like me..",3
2532,The right size sticker for nails. I love them. Perfect for supporting Autism Awareness. Everyone love them. I recommend these to anyone.,3
2533,This is very usable item. But The vinyl is very weak. So I think that this is disposable item.,3
2534,I wa really hoping this smelled like almond. However the product has a unappealing additional smell. I was disappointed.,1
2535,"Using it every night after dry brushing.  Time will tell.  Good consistency, not sticky, absorbs quickly.  Leaves skin smooth and well hydrated.",5
2536,Brake a lot have to put back togther but other then that cute can wear diffrent ways,4
2537,"Eh!

Not much difference in minimizing my wrinkles...

Maybe I have to give it more time?  But how much longer?",3
2538,So far...so good.  Used a bit for homemade beauty products.  I'm happy with it.,4
2539,I love it.!! I bought it for my daughter and I am using it.,4
2540,"It looks like a high school ring from the 70s, It is pretty,to get it for a penny coudnt ask for more",4
2541,Nice and affordable but the brush strings fall out when applying makeup,2
2542,"I like it. Better than the one I had, which was smaller. No complantes",4
2543,Does not stain your hands or rub off like the other brands. Worth every penny!,5
2544,"Although we think this has the aftertaste of a dirty mushroom, we like it and use subscribe & save to get it delivered each month.",4
2545,"These Genie Bra's are comfortable and great for lounging around the house, however, they do lack in support.",4
2546,The strips are easy to apply and whiten effectively. The only down side is that they're a little pricey (use coupons).,4
2547,"Makes high heels bearable, not comfortable. They are not miracle workers but would recommend for improving comfort.

They were received timely and with no problems.",4
2548,Solid amber bottles and good quality droppers. Well packed and ready for use.,5
2549,I'm disappointed with this razor. It leaves some razor burn but worst of all rogue hairs! I should of sent this mess back.,2
2550,"messy to use, would not purchase again and only had relief for one day",3
2551,Not as powerful as I thought it would be. Have to do a couple of passes on my face.,3
2552,"very nice, look nice. I put 4 stars because I wish to have more sparkling crystals",4
2553,The nail oil is equal to other brands I have  bought,3
2554,Nice and creamy. Makes Good bubbles. Convenient squeeze tube.,5
2555,The seal at the bottom of the water tank no longer works and it leaks everywhere!,2
2556,"GOOD WASH, WILL BUY AGAIN, SEND ME A GOOD DEAL AGAIN, OK.

  ""ROOSTER""",5
2557,These are great! Such a soft brush. Exactly what I was looking for.,4
2558,"I Got my and i Love it
It got it faster the i though...",5
2559,Blades were very good and I got around 4 shaves per blade,4
2560,I brought this item for my granddaughter and she really like it. So I would order it again thank you.,4

2562,Absolutely love this stuff. It keeps your edges laying...,5
2563,"Good size easy to use. Hard to go short short unless you take the cover off.
So far so good.  Simple easy solution.",4
2564,"This spray is a great way to cover gray roots in between coloring.  It is dark, dark brown - almost black.",2
2565,"Battery life on this unit simply makes this unit not worth it.
I barely get 2 uses out of it before the battery is completely dead.",1
2566,This is a pure Aloe Vera Gel for your skin protection and I like it to use it everyday. But its pricey for its size,4
2567,"Useful to clean gums; not as high pressured as I would've hoped. Good to use if you have permanent retainer, I suppose.",3
2568,"Smells good, but doesn't bubble up as much as, Dr. Bronner's.",4
2569,Great for working at the PDX airport. Very sturdy and I enjoy the color,4
2570,Got the wrong product--got a dropper bottle instead.  Too busy to return it.,1
2571,"Gives a nice color, smells good, and works quickly.  It warms you as you tan but doesn't give you a hot tingle.",4
2572,"Love this product! The scent is subtle, fresh and it leaves your skin feeling soft.",5
2573,Horrible. Don't order these. So small they would barely fit a 5 year old. It's a joke.,1
2574,"My hubby's only complaint would be the wrapper on the blade is somewhat difficult to remove, but the price more than makes up for this.",4
2575,Couldn't use. They were too big. Have small feet and toes.,2
2576,"Smear so easily, not even funny.  Too much red.",2
2577,Well constructed - with the column reminiscent of an old safety razor handle.  Heavy padded base keeps it in place.  Nice product.,4
2578,Not as sharp as I would have liked but a good product,3
2579,This is just a cape. There's nothing to catch hair. Don't waste your $,1
2580,Rimmel Provocalips Lip Stain is so so. Not the best but has good consistency. Not very long lasting but is a nice lipstick.,3
2581,The brushes are extremely soft and does not shed at all not to mention the case is cute.... overall GREAT DEAL,4
2582,Works better than any other non-traditional shampoo alternative I've tried.,4
2583,Not as great as I expected. The bristles are plastic and get bent easily. Still catches hair and pulls it out.,3
2584,Great shaver. Gives a good close shave with no irritation. I like the self-cleaning capability.,4
2585,"This is a perfect blush.  It lasts FOREVER. It is a great, great, great color. Either the name scares you or entices you.",4
2586,I think this might be more useful as a manicure product. I think I'm looking for an attachment that probably doesn't exist.,3
2587,Does not works!!! Waste of money!!! Do not buy,1
2588,Brushes are great for a beginner but the brissels are too soft. My daughter uses them and she is happy with them but she is 14,4
2589,"I have used Waterpik dental irrigators for many
years and they have definitely raised the bar with
this one. I highly recommend this particular
model.",5
2590,they wwre way to large for my nose they didn't fit,1
2591,Nice unit for the cost and size. Operates quietly enough with enough power to get fresh teeth. Should help with the future dentist visits.,4
2592,"it worked great until it broke down yesterday, blowing a fuse in the house at the same time. I used it twice a day, everyday.",1
2593,"I am very happy with this brush, it goes thru hair easily and is soft to the touch.",5
2594,"Solid blade, good for 5-6 shaves for me and can't beat the price. A solid purchase for safety razor fans.",4
2595,This mini groomer is AMAZING. Don't hesitate and buy as soon as possible. You won't regret it,5
2596,They're alright. OPI has drying drops for about the same price that are way better,3
2597,Was told by my Dentist to get one I did and like the way my teeth and cleaned of Plaque,4
2598,I bought for my 5 year old and I am having trouble getting it to fit on her head.  the bangs will take some styling.,3
2599,"Good stuff. I don't rinse as recommended, and haven't experienced any problems because of that.",4
2600,Edge is not properly cut and has a sharp point that will scratch and cut your face. Poor workmanship,1
2601,"The value is great but the quality is okay, they tug my hairs more than I'd like",3
2602,It broke within 2 months of use. It made very weird sound when in use and now it just doesnt work,1
2603,Smells great.  Worked well as a body soap as well as general cleaner.,4
2604,The solutions serves its purpose rather then just using water to clean the razor.,4
2605,Like the smells.  They are light and the oil stays moist a reasonable amount of time.,4
2606,Goes on well. Color doesn't last long and is lighter than I expected. Not too bad for the price though.,4
2607,This exceeded my expectations. a great shave in very little time. It holds its charge for a very long time.,5
2608,The colors are great. I should have got a picker or something. too small for my fingers and long nails. awesome for a great price!,4
2609,"Shaves just like a new shaver again and  with the new Reflex Head holder almost restores it back to a complete new razor,",4
2610,Need to apply a few coats to get smooth coverage. Not their best product.,2
2611,"pay a little more for the cordless one, the cord is a pain and this model feels pretty cheap. doesn't do a bad job though.",2
2612,Color didn't show up very well on blond hair and washed right out.  Have used many other Manic panic colors and they all worked fine.,1
2613,This trimmer didn't last more than 2 minutes.  I even tried a second set of batteries.  I'm returning it.,1
2614,"Case was fairly well constructed, but had a lot less internal space than I originally thought.",3
2615,"Works perfectly.  Solid weight, no rust, holds both my Merkur razor and badger brush perfectly.",5
2616,Too light and an odd feel to putting it on. Doesn't glide on. I wouldn't not order again,2
2617,"Has a very nice musky scent; I get a lot of compliments! Definitely works, came online today to actually order another bottle!!",4
2618,I used for my 2 yr old child . It went really well . He used to cry so much because he gets scared with regular clipper .,4
2619,"good thing to use for bridges and braces. My boyfriend and my kids love it
Pressure is good and enough tips provided",3
2620,I don't really see the difference between this and hand sanitizer other than being able to spray it on items.  The smell is nice.,3
2621,"Typical of an item that is good, but seldom used because it is inconvenient vs normal flossing.",3
2622,"Careful, had to replace mine.  Power went out and not quite sure how it got turned on while power was out, but burned unit out.",4
2623,"Rather on the expensive side, but they do work.  Just don't want to spend that much money for this product.",3
2624,The lid on this product is different than in picture. It had a large slip on cap that gets all gooy!,3
2625,The bar in the nose is pretty long so it sticks out a lot.,2
2626,"This is a wig made for a child. It is so small  doesn't fit a normal size head, picture is much better than actual product",1
2627,It's nice to be able to tie to a comfortable tightness,4
2628,"the  sticker  has  fallen off  before  the  first  use,  have  not  been  able  to get it  to work.",1
2629,Seems to do exactly what it claims.  It cleans between my teeth very well and is more pleasant than using floss.  I am happy with it.,5
2630,You get what you paid for. Not good at all. Don't bother,1
2631,"Great shaving bowl for the price, its made out of hard wood and of high qualify, highly recommended to all shavers!",5
2632,"My pedi recommended this for my newborns' dry scalp. It works very well, but can make hat wearing sticky.",4
2633,"Too much price for this item, some alcohol will do same o even job",2
2634,Lipstick was broken in the tube and stuck to the inside of the cap. unhappy,1

2639,Love the this 2-1 shampoo and conditioner.  Does wonders for my hair and enjoy using it.,5

2641,My 9 year old neice enjoys brushing her teeth more now.,5
2642,"Very pretty, not cheap looking, or too heavy. Nice! :)",5
2643,"Have used for years and it is wonderful, refreshing on my skin, and helps to repair and rejuvenate oxidation damage.",5
2644,Cute and good size but the rhinestones come out easy.,3
2645,My skin has such a nice feel after using this set!!!,5
2646,Hair sticks to it instead of gliding off although the print and size is perfect,2
2647,My boyfriend loved how well the deodorant works but the scent was not the best... a little too soapy for his taste,4
2648,Difficult for a senior with arthritis to use; awkward. Not as good as I hoped. It was easy for more able users.,2
2649,I have used this eyeshadow for many years now & love it!  It's a must for sensitive eyes!,5
2650,Its big enough to cover the tallest people and the color is really professional. The material feels like top quality.,5
2651,Meh.... waste of purchase. They move around and are kinda strange. Can just use a pantyliner. Confused on how to wash them too.,1
2652,"I love this scent unconditional Love, soft and clean. Amazons value was great also for this set. Thanks again for another great product!",5
2653,Works great! only downside is it does not come with batteries,4
2654,"I like it.  A bit soapy, and strange in the mouth, but it seems to clean and whiten the surface of my teeth.",4
2655,Great razor at a great price.  No need to spend alot of money on an expensive razor.  This one works great.,5
2656,This is a good skin for my iTouch 5G. I've had it for a while now and no problems. Good colour too.,4
2657,I wish I had bought a better Quality shaver this my 3rd shaver from this Mfg. the others shaved better and gave a closer shave.,2
2658,Purchased these out of curiosity. Interesting. May take on camping trips or keep in purse for emergency. I think I'll give one to my dentist,2
2659,Protects my hands from UV light during shellac manicure as needed.,4
2660,Bought this item again for the grandkids. Makes it so much easier to brush their hairs.,4
2661,"I actually tried it on my face and it burn and work, but for people with sensitive skin don't apply to face",3
2662,This didn't work well for my bikini line at all. I stopped before I took off skin.,1
2663,"Eh!

Not much difference in minimizing my wrinkles...

Maybe I have to give it more time?  But how much longer?",3
2664,This soap is great!!  Super rich lather. Smells great.  Really large sized bar lasts a long time.  A really good french milled soap.,4
2665,"Very nice product! Absorbs quickly. Great for hair, face and nails! Will purchase again!",5
2666,Excellent product that does exactly what it is supposed to do without perfume or other environmental hazards  without giant marketing costs.or mosquito attractants.,4
2667,"Ive used this since I started dying my hair, blonde. Great product, no yellow color. Lathers well, smells great. Great price",5
2668,Not that happy with the quality of the brissels. I would not order again online.,3
2669,What more can you say if you gave it 5 stars,5
2670,Haven't noticed any improvement using this vs. rosehips oil.,3
2671,No instructions Couldn't figure out how to use it.,1
2672,"i got this, it's huge, not a great shave, hard to get sharp lines around the sideburns or neck line.
mediocre.",3
2673,The trimmer quit working after one use. Everything else about this razor is very good. The cleaning/charging station is very nice.,3
2674,Works wonders on summer sandal feet. Do not need to scrub with that much force. Works good on rest of body if used lightly,4
2675,Has wheat in it.  Did not like it on my hair.  May work for someone else but not me.,2
2676,Best electric razor I ever owned.  End of discussion.,5
2677,"After getting whitening done at the dentist or using an at home treatment, I think that this product has been keeping the whiteness that I achieved",5
2678,Bristles seem to hold hair and the release button doesn't help.  I have had the one with black bristles and did not have this problem.,2
2679,"Hate that came it's burn after you put it on, there's no information that said it's was going to burn",3
2680,I just love this facial cleaner and its good for people with sensitive dry skin.,4
2681,I. Didn't receive what shows on the picture. I got on mail a total different item.,3
2682,"It never worked, don't waste your money because it did nothing!",1
2683,Not as good as the XL version. but it is a nice gloss so my wifes says. she gave the rest of it to a friend.,3
2684,"Making up after I've dressed, the cape keeps powder of my clothes.  Perfect",4
2685,What?!! It makes foam... and yucky scent.,1
2686,"Will not order again because item is too small to hold, and it took TOO LONG to get product!!!",2
2687,"The Norelco replacement heads work as well as the new blades.  I am well satisfied with the ordering process, delivery, and product performance.",4
2688,This color is perfection on my brown complexion.  The red really pops and doesn't dry out your lips.,5
2689,"Used this before, so, I was familiar with this face cream. I use this under a heavier cream during the day.",5
2690,After 10 minutes a huge hole formed in the glove on my thumb finger. Bummed!,2
2691,I still get insane amounts of static so I will not be buying this again.,1
2692,Meh... not what I expected. It's okay color I guess,3
2693,"Works well to cover gray, but you must spray quite a while to get the coverage. Small can doesn't go far.",4
2694,"This covers like crazy, but can't believe it's good for your scalp. Use sparingly.",4
2695,"Too small for my face, need a larger replacement please.",3
2696,Goes on evenly and feels smooth on the face does not have a makeup feel,4
2697,this razor is fantastic! the battery hasn't died in a year and it actually shaves pretty close.,5
2698,Worked well at first. After one year the rubber gasket has worn out and won't hold water in reservoir.,3
2699,Love this product!  I wear it every time I do cardio.  Noticed a difference in my trouble areas but it takes time.,5
2700,I found this to be cakey not like what I've purchased at Sephora. Returned it,1
2701,"After only a couple of months, several of the bristles are falling out making it difficult to grab the hair.",1
2702,"Jet Clean System stopped working properly, it does not go all the way down when i put it into clean mode.",2
2703,It seemed to do the job.  Got a great respond but early to be sure of products effect. very promising.,4
2704,"It may work for mild wetting but when you have to work long hours involving many physical labor then I do not believe this
one is a great choice",3
2705,Didn't like the product at all. Dried up my hair and shade was much darker than expected.,1
2706,These are great for in between visits to the salon! Very easy to use and a good value!,4
2707,Thought this would be good for my sensitive dry face. But it dried out my face.,3
2708,"very easy to use , ver effiicient way to clean you tooth, i am very satisfied with my purchase, and the price was very affordable",4
2709,"I have fine frizzy hair, and after trying multiple products to get texture and shine, I'm pleased these products actually work.",4
2710,Stay & smell clean ALL DAY! Zest is the way!,5
2711,This little tool is a MUST HAVE for any Glock owner!  It makes tear down and cleaning a total breeze!,4
2712,This razor does not produce close shaves as an expensive razor should. I have used it too many times or I would return it,2
2713,Great quality..runs a little small but ill make it work!! TY,5
2714,"Loreal Skin Genesis Pore Minimizing packagings had been opened, one of them has only 1/3 content left.it sucks!!I have already returned",2
2715,Aquaphor container was completely cracked. Ointment leaked inside box.,1
2716,"I haven't given to her yet, but I am sure she'll love them....they smell funny though.",4
2717,It is exactly what I expected. Easy to use and a  extremely light weight. Close shave if I want it.,4
2718,Unfortunately I have not found a surface yet that the suction cup will hold to for more than a minute.,1
2719,I will be a lifelong customer! This stuff is amazing,5
2720,"love it, the colors are pretty.  I sleep like under the real sky and the stars, and so relaxing...",5
2721,Took 6 weeks to get here and the strings to tie around the neck are too short to tie.,3
2722,This didn't do anything for my daughter.  I wouldn't buy it again.,1
2723,A bit tight behind the ears otherwise cute and exactly what I had in mind. I love it thank you.,4
2724,"Works slower for men who have a problem with estrogen due to medication, but it does work.",4
2725,Smells wonderful and is super soft. Very relaxing. May be too thick/heavy for some people but I find it relatively light.,5
2726,So far it is the first spot remover that I have used that actually makes a difference. I can see changes now after 4 weeks,4
2727,"We love the look and the access to extra rolls, but the top room does fall off easily.",4
2728,Wash very clean and will buy again... Bottle is tiny,4
2729,Waste of money. Frosty instead of shimmery. Anemic pink instead of the Vibrant Persimmon I thought I ordered.,1
2730,"While I do like it, it works just as well as other finishing sprays I've used.",4
2731,"i HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT IN THE PAST, VERY EFFECTIVE BREATH MINT FOR OFFENSIVE FOODS LIKE SMOKED SALMON, ONIONS, ETC",5
2732,"stop working after first use .. pump not working..

great concept but bad quality ..

one star more than enough ..",1
2733,"Cheaply made, but low priced. Does the job, but question longevity.",3
2734,"I read that colorless iodine helps problem fingernails.  I've been using it for a few weeks now, but have not yet noticed any improvement..",2
2735,I purchased this product when I was in California and liked it.  That's why I purchased it again.,4
2736,Perfect. I used this at my daughter in laws hows about 2 years ago and am thrilled to get it again.,5
2737,I'm sure these make your teeth whiter but the are very uncomfortable and you pretty much drool the whole 45 min you have them in.,2
2738,Came without a screw on the end to keep the brush on the wand  - un useable .. too bad - nice piece of equipment otherwise.,2
2739,"Seems like it's made well, but just does not stay in place.",3
2740,"Good waterpik, very powerful. Only at #4 setting so far and its pretty powerful. Would recommend this to my family and friends.",5
2741,"The brushes seem fine and the pouch is nice, but they have a somewhat strong smell of paint as soon as you unfold the pouch...",3
2742,"Though I applied this lotion, my skin was effected. Did not work for me.",1
2743,Works really well....this is my second time ordering this......,5
2744,Don't buy if u want Mehron specifically because its actually Cinema Secrets brand. Its still what u pay for i guess?,3
2745,"The quality is good and it works perfectly fine. however, the packaging can be improved specially after unpack the plastic packing as it has loosen parts !",3
2746,"They were smaller than I expected. Would have liked if they included the length. Otherwise, product is good",4
2747,Pockets on the side are to hight up  not comfortable to work in for a stylist,1
2748,"I ate fish and kept burping fish scent (yuck). Then, sucked and swallowed three pills. Voila the fish scent was gone!",5
2749,Like majority of them! Not too bad for the price I paid for them.,3
2750,"they are a little to small, but will work for now. I am satisfied.  There is a great amount of diamonds in each slot.",3
2751,"Really cute.  Feather is nice and big, but fragile.",4
2752,I like it but it is pretty thick for lotion and it is a very small bottle for the money.,3
2753,"It's a little messy but if you have generally unruly hair, as I do, this will surely do quite nicely.",4
2754,"one piece was missing a gemstone, but for the price it was still totally worth it.",5
2755,"The fabric is not satin it's something else,cheap fabric
that's what this is. Your better off buying it from Walmart
Or somewhere else.",1
2756,"This stuff really works.  It allows me to get a close, smooth shave with no burning or irritation.",4
2757,"Overall a very good buy!! Needle was not as sharp as i would have liked, but it got the job done!",4
2758,"As other reviews have said, the 99 cent mesh puff scrubbers work much better than this item.",2
2759,Do what they are designed to do. fit cleaner well,3
2760,"Great price. I love this shampoo over liquid shampoos, and it lasts just as long. My hair and scalp feel really great.",5
2761,Color is kind of funky but doesn't stain.  Smells good.  Conditions skin well.  I use it on my head.,4
2762,"It works, but not as well as my original one.  This is often hard to insert and remove the tips for some reason.",3
2763,"so far I have been using this for about two weeks. I can tell some what of a small different""s",4
2764,Product works great but bottle was only 3/4 full.  The top was taped so obviously had been opened and some of the product taken out,3
2765,"All colors are similar, i cant see the different. All are silver",3
2766,Hard to get the color out of the tube but other than that it's a really nice shade and stays put.,3
2767,Personna are just as good as these for less money.,3
2768,"Works just as simply as it appears to from its images. Just be careful with blade length while in sensitive areas, you WILL get nicked!",4
2769,"This stuff is awesome and works great!!! Perfect for
Quick root touch ups!!",5
2770,I really love this product.  It is so much value and so much to offer all in one bottle.  Would certainly purchase again.,5
2771,"A must have for very dry, sensitive skin and burns.",4
2772,I'm giving this three stars because I don't want like the way that the mouthwash foams up in my mouth.,3
2773,"non-shredding, non-stretching but slippery, hence, have to use extra length to be able to hold tight to the points where the fingers turn purple...",2
2774,"These turn copper after 1 day of wear.  Good for a night out, then toss.",1
2775,Very nice product. Thorough flossing. Too many in each pack (6 of a pack),4
2776,Exactly what is needed for a kiddo who is just plain lazy with their hygiene. This makes it easy on parents as long as the kid douses it,5
2777,"This stuff smells horrible!  I'm not sure if they will take it back or not.  I opened and smelled it, closed it back up.",1
2778,I returned it. Given 3 since its a neutral rating. It was not of much use to me. So returned it.,3
2779,I just wish there were more mustaches for more players.,4
2780,Nothing better on the market that I have come across. This is the beat hairwax available. Hair prone to buildup should probably avoid this,5
2781,Good price and they do the trick! I love them.,5
2782,Shipping by merchant fast.  Organizer OK but there are no slots for pens or pencils.  I need those.  Will keep for gift giving,3
2783,the bottle was leaking when i arrived at my house. it wasn't broken it just leaks from the roller ball. but the stuff works.,4
2784,"These nose pads did not stay on the glasses more than one day.
Do not recommend these silicone nose pads.",1
2785,Allowed me to wear my sunglasses after nose surgery.  They need to offer this in a clear though!,4
2786,"Better than most of these type products, the electric part followed by the razor was a great idea",4
2787,I find it slightly sticky feeling on my lips but looks very nice! worth what I paid,3
2788,"This product is best for body shaving, not bikini area because it does not cut very close.",5
2789,Cute but kind of small for a Barbie. It was delivered quickly.,3
2790,"Love this waterpik.  Only lasts about a year or two, but still like it. This is our third one.",4
2791,love my water pik.my dentist says he sees a diference because i hate to floss.i use it everyday with no problems.,5
2792,"doesn't do anything to my hair, not even soften it",2
2793,My favorite for my face. I put it on after I wash my face. It smooths out wrinkles and moisturizes deeply. Love it!!!,5
2794,Problem is that the top of the cap is not abrasive enough to keep your finger from slipping off.  Otherwise fine.,3
2795,it a good product it lubricate my machine nice and keep it in good running condition . Recommend this product.,4
2796,"It is not what they offer in pictures. They offer stickers but those are made of paper, and are difficult to use",3
2797,"Smells really good! Haven't noticed anything yet, but the smell is great",4
2798,Don't bother...Invest your money elsewhere. It arrived nothing like in the picture.,1
2799,"chain is very short, almost touching your neck.  Might be suitable for a pre-teen or early teenager.  Stone is too big in comparison to dolphins.",3
2800,It's actually more than I expected.  Very strong looks like 925. It's very small tho.  I have a tiny wrist .,4
2801,Great replacement for Braun shaver cleaning system. Definitely a great deal when you pair the shipping costs.,4
2802,"A little hard to apply. If you want a vampy color, this would be a good choice.",3
2803,It was a little old and had gotten smaller than usual.,2
2804,"Love the product, but it was supposed to be a double pack",3
2805,They come off so easy. Three of the colors completely came of the roll and had to toss.,1
2806,"Pack not included
- 8 Handle stickers
- 2 Bonus sticker sheets
- manual
Urgent : Please check this order and contact back

Thank you",2
2807,have not used yet but have handled.  feels great in my hands and sharp.,4
2808,Have had this razor for a month and it shaves very well.  So far over 25 shaves and I have not had to recharge it!,5
2809,Alright for nails but very plastic looking... May not be good for other small projects,3
2810,"Great product! The cleaning unit is a bit bulky, but overall its a great item",4
2811,This case is VERY small.  It will hold a pair of readers or possibly a child's glasses,1
2812,Not what I was expecting with this item.  Thinking that the scissors were going to be longer that what the item said.,2
2813,"Ir'a whaterproof, but it is not the color shown in the picture. It's brown.",2
2814,I use it to make a wig.looking good so far no shedding.shipping is fast too.,4
2815,Poo poo poo! Broke first time I wore it! What a waste !,1
2816,gave this as a gift but she thought it smelled great,5
2817,Replacement blades for my shaver are becoming harder to find. This web site made it easy to find the correct replacement part and order same.,4
2818,It infected my piercing and I had to take it out.,1
2819,Boooo! These colors look nothing like the photos/swatches! I thought I was getting hot pink and purple and I got dull and muted mauve and dusty rose,1
2820,Its a good kit overall the brush was horrible i couldn't work with it at all,4
2821,"Good quality razor blade, never had an issue with Astra",4
2822,"If you are a new user, watch out for the splash if you are not pressing the control properly, put some listerine on flushing.",3
2823,"Does exactly what it claims. Imparts a nice shine and as a bonus, manageability.",4
2824,beautiful but slid off the head real easy. still very beautiful,2
2825,It works ok.. If you hook up a violet wand to your self and use this it will work EVEN BETTER!!,4
2826,I don't really see a difference and it was difficult to apply.,2
2827,Received it very quickly but the bracelet part was huge and it broke the first time I wore it.,2
2828,"Zero stars. After 15 minutes under the lamp, one coat of top coat still is not dry. Do not purchase this item.",1
2829,"Perfect shade, It's hard to find a good match.  No cons and it last a long time.  And it's great quality.",4
2830,"Poor extension to a poor, disappointing product. Philips has almost no customer services hours (forget 24/7). What era do we live in?",1
2831,Ok item. It works well but wood became rotten color on a week.,2
2832,"Fantastic quality! We use this in the driest skin! Cuticles heals scars
Huge container, were set for a while!",5
2833,you get what you pay for...top quality...what a difference using this blush versus the cheaper ones...,5
2834,i have super ensitive skin and everything from 7 oclock to feathers gave me ingrowns and razor bumps. these dont. i will continue to use these,5
2835,"Arrived when it was supposed to, works very quickly. Good stuff.",5
2836,Very finicky and eventually struggles to vaporize even after following the cleaning regime. Very cheaply made. You get what you pay for.,2
2837,"Made my lips super sticky. Although the color looks nice in the picture, it looked weird on my lips.",1
2838,"Not sure, why people are giving it 4 or five stars, have been using it for few months and no results.",1
2839,Not finely sifted. Needs to be sifted to use with natural curly textured hair.,3
2840,Blade had ridges all the way back instead of just on the tip like it's shown in the pic on here.,1
2841,I get filthy at work and this thing scrubs it right off and lasts,5
2842,They are small fitting.  I would have preferred a choice of sizes. They don't stretch enough for my liking. thanks,3
2843,Case is fine. Amazon did not send bonus gift (stylus) with it.,2
2844,"Not impressed with these strips, we found a different brand gel application that worked better. Check out 3m clinpro 5000 toothpaste.",2
2845,Very sharp blade. Still evaluating how it glides. Not sure Platinum is for me.,3
2846,I left it in for 5 mins then washed my hair and my hair came out a lot more than usual,1
2847,"Good shave, you can clean easily all parts.
Not for body hair trimming.
Battery is enough for many shaves.
Nice!!!",4
2848,Great shampoo for traveling! I use it with Dr. Bronner's leave in conditioner. Works great!,4
2849,"Horrible, it least you hair greasy and lifeless. did not work for me at all. I wish I can return it",1
2850,hey they work..what more can be said..they hold together and reusable for that fact,3
2851,You can't really see the color and when you apply the tip comes off,1
2852,Cheap material and neck size is a little small but does the job for the price,4
2853,It was the first body groom that I have ever tried. I guess this works better than razor or other products are made for men.,5
2854,"Easy to work with. Rinse out the excess, dry off the lid and bottom of bowl and lid seals the bowl shut.",5
2855,my bottle came half filled. I'd send it back but it came from China,1
2856,This lipstick wears off leaving an exaggerated outline on the lips.  So you need to carry the lipstick with you for touch ups.,3
2857,The pink is too bright for my skin tone. Went well with a pink outfit though,3
2858,I thought this was awesome when I found this brand but not sure if I would buy these two (shampoo & conditioner) again for my hair.,3
2859,Very nice shade for a flush to the skin and nothing obvious. Love the matte finish which is perfect for the very hot climate I live in.,4
2860,I love blue bought it to match my blue ring Thanks Vicky K,5
2861,Got this today way to light.  It's under the tan but it's pale,1
2862,"Nice color, great coverage of grey hair! Color a  little darker than I thought.",4
2863,After a week of wearing it a small hole is kinda starting to form at the top,1
2864,"compared to the old Waterpik I replaced, this model barely has enough water pressure to get the job done.",2
2865,This shaver maintains the high standards of Norelco which I have enjoyed using for decades.,4
2866,One of my fave items to use for my face and hair.  Execellent seller.,5
2867,"Wonderful Razor! Would defiantly buy again, but I dislike the two dabs of glue on the center of the blade from the packaging.",4
2868,"It's a nice little trimmer for the price but be careful or you'll nick yourself. Also, it will rust if you get it wet.",4
2869,I did not like this product. They are too small and made my foot feel worse. They need to be wider and not so thick.,1
2870,Very handsome way to store and display brush and safety razor.,4
2871,This product does cover the roots but it kept coming off on my hands all day whenever I touched my hair.,2
2872,"Though I applied this lotion, my skin was effected. Did not work for me.",1
2873,"verrry small jar for the price, seems to work ok, but won't last long.",3
2874,Did not come with the brush and the liquid monomer was completely dried up.,1
2875,"Has not work very well for me and is too thick... I will not purchase again, thank you so much.",2
2876,This was very dull and dry. I would not buy it again.,1
2877,works well before electric shave... a little goes a long way,3
2878,It's awesome. I used it before but it's been years. I was afraid it was not the real product but it is.,4
2879,Picked these up very cheap - would pay more as they are easy to use and a great way to floss compared to regular dental floss.,5
2880,The medium/light brown is more suitable for someone with very dark (almost black) hair.  I will not reorder.,3
2881,"Great mirror finish, and heavily weighted on the bottom so it doesn't tip over easily.",5
2882,"This is not Botox but for 15 bucks, it does brighten my face and soften wrinkles. I'll always use this in my daily regimen.",4
2883,"I thought it would come in the red or blue color, but I received 4 ugly grey colors.  Not impressed.",2
2884,"Cheap and a little uncomfortable, but you get what you pay for. They do the job.",4
2885,Works about as well as all the other products have tried Which is not much,2
2886,"This is a great little machine, not quite as strong as my old water pick
and the storage department for extra picks is just ok",3
2887,"I really like the smell of this product.
However, it leaves my daughters fine hair sticky and a little greasy looking.",3
2888,Perfect and highly recommended. Stopped a 30 years nasty habit,5
2889,This is a waste of money!  You have to shower to rinse it off completely....money down the drain!,1
2890,Kind of small. Has not really become a go-to item.,3
2891,"This color was lighter than it appeared and was really dry on your lips. Didn't care for it, wasn't worth the money.",1
2892,"Have used this for ten years.  They last between two and three years for us.  But, no cavities and no bad breath.",5
2893,Thought it would be a hot air brush.  Isn't really.  Doesn't do what I thought it would.  Blow and curl.,2
2894,"arrived early, beautifully colored, they didn't stay in very well, but good for the price.",4
2895,"Prompt service, but bracelet is much smaller than it looks.",3
2896,"I'm hooked on this lotion!  It smells so good, I can't get enough of it!",5
2897,These did not last long. They wouldn't stay put.,1
2898,You can cut the hair very short and without having to worry about nicking or cutting yourself!!,5
2899,Overall very satisfied with Mitts.  The advertisement should have stated that creme is needed along with gloves to use Mitts.,4
2900,when i received product it was leaking almost over half gone i have used the product 4 times does not work very disappointed,1
2901,Did not find that this product did anything for hemorrhoids as advertised.  Would not purchase again.,2
2902,"So smooth, not sticky at all. Really absorbed well into my skin! Can't wait to see results!",5
2903,Great item deep cleaning of the skin an it keeps aceny away.,5
2904,"Love love them where have these been,!  I love to change up my tattoo.  Never permant. Thank you love it",5
2905,"Worth the money, works great, have multiple razor level options (0 to 5), small and light weight, easy to carry.",5
2906,Came curly and get's tangled and kinky looking when you brush it out.  Purchased dark brown but def has more reddish undertone.,2
2907,It doesn't meet my expectations based on reviews I've seen. Would prefer to buy a Philips device instead... Unless my unit has any problem...,1
2908,Everything was as promised.  Any problems were because it takes a while to get used to using it.  Practice makes perfect!,5
2909,It's good... nice to help 'fix' scents of other products.,4
2910,Does not work for Twin Turbo 2600 Hair Dryer - do not buy it if this is what you have!!!!,1
2911,"The price is an excellent value compared to stores.

2999,"Good cream, just a bit pricey in my opinion.",3
3000,Strength of the water flow wasn't as strong as I like but other than that it gets the job done,4
3001,I take these as soon as I feel something like a cold coming on and it works. The trick is to take it early enough.,4

3016,You could find a better looking dog tag at a dollar tree. Dont waste your money.,2
3017,The glass containers are good but one was broken when I got them.  I didn't return them because of the price.,3
3018,Best moisturizing/healing creme..Not too greasy. Slight scent to it but not too overbearing.,5

3025,Add shows brush comes with three replacement sponges...I did not receive thesse.,2
3026,"Container was dented and unsealed. Labeling was peeling and faded. I did not trust this product , so I did not use it.",1
3027,Perfect for short hair to tighten the curl and adds a nice shine.  Not greasy.,5
3028,Amazon has the best price with a $35 order otherwise I would never buy it.  It does help when you are using a dry electric shaver.,4
3029,This is a good serum but it tends to leave sort of oily residue when I wake from sleeping in it. Makes my skin soft.,4
3030,The blades are thinner and lighter weight than I expected. They are unexpectedly  extremely sharp and  very durable. I am very pleased with this product.,5
3031,"I feel like this is much better than regular flossing, all be it can be messy if you aren't paying attention.",5
3032,"Love, love this, just wish it were not so expensive.",5

3034,Started leaking within two months. Came back from vacation with a puddle of blue liquid all over my bathroom floor. Unbreakable my ass.,1
3035,Besides the forever wait on shipping.. The stones are dull and the variety was few. I expected more shine and colors to choose from.,2
3036,Works wonderfu!  A must for periodontal issues and anyone with braces.  It will prevent alot of problems down the road.,5
3037,The first day I got the came off the stick I was really disappointed but it's good tho,4
3038,does trim not shave but that is what I wanted. Like the adjustable trim guide.,4
3039,Hated it. I don't think it did any cleaning. And it smelled weird.,1
3040,One of the colors was broken and was all over the  other colors total mess.,2
3041,I bought this trimmer to shave my baby's head.  Worked well for that purpose.  It is relatively quiet and does not scare the baby.,4
3042,"Really good product. But, it was darker than I thought it would be.",5
3043,It did not work for my two boys.  Hopefully it works for yours if you have already purchased a bottle.,2
3044,"Not what I though, there just like color makers, not worth the money",2
3045,"Poorly made, smaller than described and was broken! The description on the package said earings...wtf?",1
3046,"k, these are not the best, but will do :)",3

3055,The only thing I received was an empty bottle. It leaked all over the box before I even got it.,1
3056,no list of ingredients. It stinks. Back of product says 2006. You get what you pay for. Purchase at your own risk.,1
3057,I have short hair.  the cord dosen't rotate when I turn the brush very well. Not so good for me.,3
3058,The eyeliner brush was the only brush for use to me because the others' bristles comes out. I don't recommend to buy this.,1
3059,"Definitely a great buy ... you have to be paitent when using it, but it works very well",4
3060,Very silky short tie won't let me wrap completely around my head tho,4
3061,"I bought to test, and approved. Definitely i recommend... I prefer de aqua fresh one. But i will buy again... It's Ok",3
3062,im not a big bra wearer but when i have to wear one i would recomend these bras. just wish sizing was better.,4
3063,"Too small, it looks a lot bigger than it really is. Not as great as I assumed it would be.",2
3064,It is difficult to put together without help & doesn't stay suctioned to wall. Would not recomend & very poorly made.,1
3065,"one of not many lash conditioners that didn't irritate my eyes, however I didn't see any difference in their growth",4
3066,Works ok but the smell is too strong and lingers forever on your electric razor.,3
3067,$65 for one bottles of soap!! Do NOT use this sight unless you are very wealthy!,5
3068,The sponge tip is easy to use but the brush is in an odd place and is hard to use.,4
3069,Not happy I bought it bc I'm American Indian and very hairy dark hair on my face and it didn't cover anything.. very disappointed,1
3070,What a refreshing oral hygiene tool to use.  Leaves the mouth feeling refreshed and clean.  Wish I had been encouraged to use it many years ago.,5
3071,"Loved this owl,Nice and big to compliment a plain outfit.",5
3072,"If to mouth rinse with Crest before the bed, then there is no bad feeling in the mouth in the morning. I like it.",4
3073,The scent has changed from a couple years ago when I first bought it.  Why can't companies keep a good thing?,2
3074,"Would have given it 5 stars, but the noise level when using is annoying.  Otherwise works great.",4
3075,These are hard to find. A must have when I curl my hair. Light weight and easy to use. Get's the job done,4
3076,"compared to its original pricing, this package deal is SO worth the money. a little goes a long way too!",5
3077,"nice looking, sturdy, holds my brush and razor just fine. good buy",4
3078,Wasnt my colour and i kept texting but no response...very bad,1
3079,"Stand is sturdy, looks great and happens to match my safety razors finish.",4
3080,"Good stand. Holds my safety razor great, and will accommodate your brush.",4
3081,"I have been using it for 3 weeks. But, no benefit seen yet. Will try the rest of the rinse for another 3 weeks.",3
3082,It works awesome with only a small amount needed! Also works great to thin new nail polishes that are a little too think or dark,4
3083,"Use very little at first, like pinhead size. Or...it will clog your pores",4
3084,Favorite belly ring ever! Love it! So pretty and exactly like the picture!!,5
3085,"Teeth were 2 shades whiter after using this product-very simple to use, and I experienced no sensitivity.",4
3086,lasted about 2 years of hard use (traveling) before the battery died and it would not recharge. Am buying another more expensive model.,4
3087,Hold my shaving brush and DE razor. No rust after 9 months.,5
3088,Wish it was a little rougher and left my skin feeling softer. Pair it with a harsh salt body scrub and you're good to go,3
3089,husband likes these razors. they are on our monthly order list (subscribe) so they come on a reg basis,4
3090,"I like the packaging.  Easy to apply and travel with.  But, I am not crazy about the color I bought.",4
3091,My daughter loves this. She uses it all the time. She couldn't be happier!,5
3092,Its been almost 2 months and I haven't receibed anything !!,1
3093,Very average product. Smell is ok but quite weak. Also the cream is way too runny. Works fine though and doesnt dry the skin.,3
3094,Looks great and is nice and heavy unlike others I found.,5
3095,I love this lipstick especially for the price. It's a very mellow color that will compliment any outfit. I'll definitely buy again. :),5
3096,"Stickers are hard to remove and are very uncomfortable, will only work for very small breasts. not practical at all",1
3097,"It's a glycerin like bar, and it's good, but not better than Dr. Bronners Magic Soaps.",2
3098,The box says it's quiter than earlier models - no ttrue.  This unit is very loud and annoying.  Works great otherwise,3
3099,does not work and have an unnatural scent! wish i could return,1
3100,Thought it would be a hot air brush.  Isn't really.  Doesn't do what I thought it would.  Blow and curl.,2
3101,"It cuts, it works.  We'll see hot it is for the sensitive areas.",4
3102,"good product, not what i expected but, after 3 of this you can see the difference...",3
3103,Worksi well/ bytes can cause acne if you use it too much and have sensitive skin.,4
3104,Did the trick... nice looking tiara with some weight to it... held in place well.,4
3105,"Very useful for my nail art, but the strips are hard to pull off the wheel",4
3106,"This toothbrush is labled Soft, but does not feel soft enough. These toothbrushes feel more like medium toothbrush.  Good value otherwise.",2
3107,I feel like these were not as durable as the ones I actually bought from the body shop store in the mall. They are already falling apart..,3
3108,"My wife loves it! I can't comment on its efficacy, but maybe it is the placebo effect.",4
3109,Once you get used to working with it is very good. Even after brushing & string flossing still gets more food from between teeth.,4
3110,It works well but it made a terrible mess. It crumbled everywhere!,2
3111,"I want to say first that I have very sensitive skin, but I have purchased other blades that don't cause irritation like these do.",1
3112,"Very sturdy in appearance, but a little big for small buttonholes like dress shirt collars. It still worked though.",4
3113,I love the way it softens my skin and lays the foundation for my daily moisterizer.  The only slight annoyance is the smell.,4
3114,Smells like floor cleaning fluid and does not moisturizer well.,1
3115,Color wasn't as natural as I thought it would be.  Wouldn't buy it again.,3
3116,Dont Get Product lt Stains Your Lips & Can get very Stick DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY !!,1
3117,NO COMPLAINTS!!! Received it like I would have if i purchased it at a store. Very Satisfied!,5
3118,"Great product, too dark for my skin color, but i would definitely buy again in the right color!!",4
3119,Was hoping for a textured scrubby - but more like soft-leather - kind of just smears.,2
3120,"It smelled really rancid. Not sure if it was bad stock or thats how Almonds smell.
Also the product is too thin and watery.",2
3121,It was not the original ! It came with a pump and the color and consistency was completely off so couldn't use it at all,1
3122,Easy to use and my teeth feel like I just came from the dentist. Everyone should have one of these. Worth the money.,5
3123,Terrible mix. Didn't think it was actually going to make me smell like I smoked in the forests,1
3124,This is a very addicting game. lots to do and all in a great deal. all downloadable content was included. very happy customer.,5
3125,"I ordered 6 of these and none of them were alike, each one was different.",1
3126,"They don't do anything for me, just a weird minty taste",2
3127,"did not like the quality at all
there is no way that was made with Swarovski cristals!!!!",2
3128,This is nothing like what they use to make about 5 or 6 years ago.  It is not a good example of their lift and cut system,3
3129,not good hairs i lost money with this mannequin i don't know i will get money back,2
3130,This product removes dry skin spots and makes skin very smooth when used consistently. I certainly would recommend this product.,4
3131,Not as described.  Thick chain that literally wrapped around my neck and body 2 full times. cheaply made as well.,1
3132,"It is excelent for styling the hair. It is easy yo use, i am happy with it. I recomiend it for all women",4
3133,good for styling but does have a smell that I did feel in the beginning but now I can.,4
3134,"Some tanning bed light still peaks into the lens'. Though they get the job done, they don't offer the best protection for your eyes.",3
3135,These are perfect for my purse and my car and fit the lipstick right.  Great price and better quality than I expected,3
3136,Seems to take about 10-15 min. to numb fully. Apply generously & leave on. Didn't taste bad like i expected.,4
3137,"Bad bottle,scent isn't good,feel nothing like before",1
3138,"Very obvious whitening of the teeth but as soon as you stop using the trays, your teeth go back to the way they used to look",3
3139,Made me a bit rashy and the aroma is not great.,1
3140,The glitter is tiny! Not at all like the photos. It's seriously just your average craft glitter.,1
3141,everything is great with the exception of the dispenser cap.,4
3142,Many people never hear of this.  It seems pretty good for press and curl hair.,3
3143,This is an awesome product that I mix with a number of other products for my hair which works wonders..,5
3144,"This doesn't work. It smells great, but doesn't remove hair.",1
3145,I found the same brand same specifications at much lower price at Walmart. same price or less for a higher level of  same band at walmart.,1
3146,"They don't get your teeth ""movie star white,"" but they do noticeably whiten your teeth and are pretty easy to use.",4
3147,"Used about 8 times, 15 minutes each.  It burnt out and won't turn on anymore.",1
3148,Bought this from Johnson Distributors. Doesn't seem same. Usually buy from Kerastase direct. Been using for years. Not same.,1
3149,"Great deal, but I must be sensitive to the ingrediants because they burned.",3
3150,I like the fact that I seem to walk better while taking this product.,4
3151,Product delivered promptly & as ordered.  It is attractive & function able.  Seems to be well made.,4
3152,The pearls in the middle all drop out when I open the package.,1
3153,Great smell and perfect way to relax after a long stressful day. Great on people with sensitive skin as well. Highly recommend.,4
3154,"Waste of money, your better off buying elmers glue. Didn't stick at all!!",1
3155,"VERY Disappointed, The Flowers are NOT real they are plastic!",1
3156,I have facial cranial hyperhydrosis and this product did absolutely nothing to alleviate my excessive sweating.,1
3157,good starter kit...buy a different wax though..the cream wax doesnt work,4
3158,got mine today two of the top balls broke :/,2
3159,Only used it a couple times haven't had any issues,4
3160,"A lot of toe separators for the money. And they aren't too bulky, making it easy to polish my toes.",4
3161,Lipstick was not sealed and it does not swivel upward so essentially a rotten deal two times over!,1
3162,"Date of manufacture not mentioned. Hope the product is nice, since all Patanjali products are always known to be excellent!",3
3163,"Horrible!! As soon as I opened the it was broken ! Do not buy this belly ring a waste of money , you'll regret it.",1
3164,"Nice fragrance, but it stll doesn't smell as good as the Old Coty Wild Musk!",4
3165,Pretty bad quality. Was cute while it lasted before breaking (6 hours),3
3166,"This Kerastase line is great - hair are softer, brighter and fell full of vitamins - i love this line",5
3167,so far- one of the blades was unusable as it was bent. :( A lot of money for a bent cartridge.,2
3168,"2 of the three bottles pumps do not work.  But otherwise, product does a good job when shaving in sensitive areas.",4
3169,A tried and true product.. been using this for years!,5
3170,"awesome deal, better than anything I have every bought at any store, the shave is close like a razor and efficient, would highly recommend...",4
3171,"Nice to have individual packs,  easy to carry.  Does a good job.  Always good to have extra on hand for company.",5
3172,Purchased for my wife. Lighter than what she has expected. No problem with the quality of the product,3
3173,Works as advertised.....I use only the original equipment fluid in my Norelco shaver.,4
3174,They are not the best. Not as sharp as I needed them to be.,3
3175,"Famous Nars color, but not bright enough for me.  My skin absorbs color, and I looked washed out.  Maybe I should layer it.",3
3176,Love this. It helps to get me through to my next hair appointment. Even my hairdresser was impressed with the coverage.,4
3177,the color is ok. But not for an olive / mediterranean skin tone.,3
3178,It works well enough.  It is just after I bought this I found out the alkaline diet is bunk.  No truth in it.,4
3179,Not worth the money. They are charging $199.00 for replacement blades. Morello has gone crazy with greed.,1
3180,A co-worker recommended this to me and im so glad she did! The product came within 2 days and its such a great color.,4
3181,"Didn't realize this stuff is like rope, won't fit with 1/2 my teeth.",1
3182,Does what it supposed to do. Choice of several heads,4
3183,Horrible! Knock off brand! I returned it! Don't buy!,1
3184,"My old one wore out after years of service.  The new one is smaller, yet easier to use and comes with a variety of flossing tips.",5
3185,"The cones do not have a significant scent to them, but more of a calming one.  The product was shipped and delivered on time.",4
3186,"Started to tarnish within a few months, otherwise the design was perfect",1
3187,"This stuff is amazing! My pores look so much small, it's cruelty-free, and dries quickly.",5
3188,This product is made of great quality. It looks great in my bathroom and keeps the rolls in order until needed.,4
3189,It works well but it made a terrible mess. It crumbled everywhere!,2
3190,It was easy to apply on and take off.  Works like what it said it would and last okay.  I will be using this product again.,4
3191,"Great value for the price, but for us there is an overabundance of attachments.  I guess it depends on what the user needs are.",4
3192,on & off switch is very cheap. don't look for this to last very long. would not buy this again,3
3193,Very over priced.  I thought there were three bottles not just one.,2
3194,Works well but the combs keep coming out of the curling wand.,3
3195,"This product is simple to use and takes little space on my vanity.
Has different jet tips for different needs.
I am pleased with it.",4
3196,The price is right and it arrived on time but too uncomfortable to wear. They don't fit well and don't cover the entire eye area.,2
3197,"Very well made, fastest shipping ever ! extremely happy with this product. Will purchase a different color in the future.",5
3198,Arrived with multiple kinks in it - won't be able to use it. Waste of money.,1
3199,To tight I had to give them to my 3 yr old niece,1
3200,You can't beat the immediate effects! Especially not at such a great price. My very sensitive acne prone skin loves this stuff!!!,5
3201,"It works, but bristles degrade, bend, etc, really fast. For the money I can't complain.",3
3202,Not thrilled with the cap. It did not work as well as I expected.,3
3203,"Great natural deodorant for a young boy. Now, to get him to use it every day.",4
3204,Wish the neck were smaller. We just clip it with a claw clip and it works fine for both my husband and my sons.,4
3205,These refills did not fit my Maybelline eyelash curler.  I could not use these at all.  Waste of money!,1
3206,"This is a great shaver! Close shave - long battery life. A little loud, but not loud enough to annoy anyone through a closed door.",4
3207,"A lot goes a long way. Rich and thick. Does not get rid of sunspots as fast as I would like, but moisturizes skin effectively.",5
3208,"It's good, just the smell is... too sweet, like a candy but not fruit.",4
3209,"Compact unit. Works very well. They should have made the hose longer, though.",4
3210,"I didn't get the piercing pad, but the needle is sharp.",3
3211,These didn't work as well as I expected.  Serious garlic requires serious breath freshener.,3
3212,"I have a hard time making them stick, then when I do they don't last long on the nail.",2
3213,Not really a creme more like a heavy smooth paste. Wouldn't buy for mature or dry skin because in my experience it wasn't moisturizing.,3
3214,"this product has it's issues  flakes and darkens the lid - though largely a wonderful product , really helps accentuate lashes",4
3215,"I have only used this a few times and haven't seen a huge difference in fine lines, etc....maybe with time and more useage.",3
3216,"It smelled really rancid. Not sure if it was bad stock or thats how Almonds smell.
Also the product is too thin and watery.",2
3217,It feels like a toy.  There is not enough difference between the high and low settings.,2
3218,"Great products! It help me to clear my teeth very well.
I love this products. I will buy the other one to my family.",5
3219,"This is the same unit I had for years, but this one is very noisy. Need to replace it for a quiet one.",2
3220,excellent item...helps in car and outside both ...great price...hope they make it little bit darker,5
3221,The color came off and stained my finger within a couple of days,1
3222,its to me seems lighter than the photo ad. ill have find away tone it down some.,3
3223,"It is very simple as exspected, I purchased this for my grand daughters and it's adorable. We like it. :)",4
3224,My sister said that it worked wonders for her but it gave me a little burning sensation!!,3
3225,I love them but the bar is a bit to short a little taller would be perfect but I love them,4
3226,Can't say much but my hairloss is slowing decreasing. Maybe in a few months from now all see more prominent results,3
3227,"It is ok.  It does the job after several passes.  It will do the job, but do not expect greatness.",3
3228,Very small. Very very small. Fits like a 20-22. Debris and gunk in the packaging. But very cute and easy to insert.,3
3229,I can't say that it really helped me. I didn't use it long enough to notice and that is only because it stung.,3
3230,"May not give as many shaves as a heavier gauge blade, but the cost per blade makes up for it.",4
3231,This product did nothing for me and I used it faithfully. Possibly nothing out there that will help with pores and blackheads.,2
3232,Does as expected but doesnt give a strong a hold as some of the latex based in my opinion.,3
3233,"Not quite as heavy as I'd expected, but it is fine.",4
3234,This turkey charm very well made. I was pleased with it and will buy from Pugster in the again.,4
3235,"Havent seen results yet, but make sure you read the back of the box. Kinda scared to use it after I read it.",2
3236,Purchased there for a headband making station activity for baby shower.  Product was very diverse and good quality.,4
3237,"soft, comfortable, washable.  wear with or without shoes; it will do the job.",4
3238,"This soap is the best.  It smells great, doesnt dry out your  skin, lasts a long time, and never stings your eyes.",5
3239,I absolutely dislike it. It's inconvenient. I gave it to my mum and bought another one trimmer. It's a Huge disappointment.,1
3240,"didnt really work. maybe an A cup or a B, but not for a C",1
3241,This is a joke it's not working for me im so sad about the result,1
3242,Nice decorative way to store your soap. I imagine it might warp if left in water but rinsing it is easy enough when done.,4
3243,I like the product just remember a little goes a long ways.,4
3244,This stuff made my fine hair very gunky and sticky without providing any volume.  Back to my BigSexyHair booster powder.,1
3245,Quick delivery and in good order.  The reservoir is smaller than I would like but it performs well.,4
3246,Absolutely love this product.  Very classy looking and durable.  Would definitely buy again.,5
3247,"Although I like the coverage and everything, I didn't expect to see shimmer in a foundation.",4
3248,"The color is crimsondifferent with the picture, and the lipstick is very very dry.",2
3249,I really like the scent of this product. It's not overpowering or an 'in your face' kind of a smell.,5
3250,"Doesn't exactly ""wow"" me.  Product works much more slowly than promised.  I may as well go back to good old Coppertone.",3
3251,I like this product. It takes care of business.,4
3252,some of the brushes seem to be falling a part. i really like it anyway. and i can live with it not being perfect.,4
3253,This is a good product that does the job it is supposed to do,4
3254,"Pretty small for the price but we were please with the product
Thanks!",3
3255,This stuff really gives a great shave.  I put it on with my old shaving brush so I don't waste any.,5
3256,doesn't work....waste of money.....used for 2 months and now its non returnable....same for eye serum,1
3257,I expected better results using this but did not see a big difference. It felt good on my skin and smells wonderful though.,4
3258,They are a nice addition to the gift baskets I made.  They not really sturdy but they serve the purpose.,4
3259,"It's difficult to find a 5/8"" curling brush, and this one is very nice. It has a good grip for your hand.",4
3260,It's ok - was not what I expected but it is adequate.,3
3261,Omg!!!!! Still speechless.....IT WORKS!!!!,5
3262,It might not look like the pix but still well made and was at a great price when I got it,4
3263,These replacement bulbs get so hot I'm sweating by the time I finish my makeup.,2
3264,I had sever reaction to the serum after a few days of using it.,1
3265,Trying to find what works best for me and this is okay.,3
3266,These glitter mascaras do not deposit any glitter effect to the eyelashes.  It is as though they are dried up.,1
3267,"The first one didn't work, and I returned it to the company.
The second one is working .",3
3268,One chain was way longer than the others; creating an uneven look.,2
3269,"This item has a good grip on the hair.  the only thing, it heats too slowly.",4
3270,The powder brush was hard to blend and shred like crazy.,2
3271,"I use it because it's all I have, but the cord tangles instead of twisting as it should. too Bad.",2
3272,I really like this lip color. It tastes good too. Nice color. Thank you.,5
3273,Product did not come in a box from Dermalogica nor did it have a safety seal - raising concerns about the integrity of the product.,2
3274,Nice and long to reach all the way down my giant back!,4
3275,You must beware of these goods cause darkening of the skin,1
3276,We have these all over the house ... the on-line price is right!,5
3277,Very low pressure... would prefer to have some more power.,1
3278,This item does not work - like they claim it does.,1
3279,"Blades are not officially made by Astra, original Astra blades are individually branded with the Astra name, blades are extremely dull!!!",1
3280,"I really like this color. I'm pretty pale, so I always love the brownish colors.",4
3281,"I love the natural ingredients, the thickness, the smell is great.",4
3282,"I still have it, almost to the end will order more",5
3283,Don't ever use Gigi Creme Wax. Its seriously like glue--impossible to get off and makes a huge mess! Extremely unsatisfied!,1
3284,"Great box, takes up less room and holds more that my previous box.",5
3285,"I bought this one, because my old one stopped working, right after the warranty lapsed. It does a great job.",4
3286,"All the benefits of flossing with less effort.  Works great for my daughter with braces.  It is powerful and effective,",5
3287,Allows me to remove food particles from areas I had a hard time getting with my toothbrush and dental floss.  Wish I  had bought this ago.,4
3288,what good is this if it rolls off your chest when you lay down? it didn't stay in place unless i was standing up.,1
3289,great till it broke after 2 - 3 uses. they wouldn't replace it.,1
3290,I ordered a multi color and i got only all pink. And they are pretty big too thought they were the smallest size.,2
3291,Did not do anything for my skin. Clogged my pores,2
3292,Didn't fit brush and razor! Too late to return it now.,1
3293,Terribly blades... they rip the hair off my face and cut me up pretty bad. Two stars because they are so inexpensive.,2
3294,"I love the fact the ingredience are natural, but I which the deodorant would hold up better during hot summer days",3
3295,"Product did not work as advertised, considered returning but due to the low cost of the product did not bother with the hassel.",1
3296,My husband uses these.  He likes that there is a rough side along with the normal loofa.,4
3297,This is the best cream I know of for really calloused feet or elbows.,4
3298,"Love this Blush, it is the only brand of blush I will wear. NARS is quality and you will not be disappointed",5
3299,"The serrations are only on one side of the knife for use by right-handed people. Since I am left-handed, I can't really use the knife.",2
3300,Love it even though it doesn't glow in the dark,4
3301,"Did not do any affect on me, but I guess every person is different. The smell is so so, like some kind of essential oil.",4
3302,Very small. Clipping the ends on the sweater is difficult due to how small the clips are. The size makes it hard to manipulate.,2
3303,Seems like it takes the wax a really long time to melt.,3
3304,Very thin bars of soap.  I would also like them labeled.  I wanted to try various scents.  I have no idea what kind they are.,2
3305,Decent product but not worth the price. Used it for a week. Thick. Can buy a BB Cream at walgreens for far cheaper.,3
3306,Works well but I feel like water stream isn't strong enough even at max.,3
3307,Product is either defective or really old.  The solid breaks apart and crumbles everywhere on the first use.,1
3308,works great leaves you very smooth much better than shaving cream.,5
3309,"burned my wife's face, will never buy this again.. would not recommend to any one",1
3310,Way too big and broke as I was trying to re-size it. Cheaply made. Would not repurchase.,1
3311,Correct product but thought it came in a spray bottle like the photo.,3
3312,love them thank you cant wait2 show my nails off they look so beautiful thank u so much have a wonderful day,5
3313,"Easy to use, trims just right amount. Wish I'd had a long time ago. Shapes very well without leaving area prickly.
Highly recommend.",5
3314,Product is everything that I was looking for in a hand held barrel hair dryer.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants a good hair drier.,5
3315,The power switch broke after using it twice. I will not recommend this product to anyone. I would like it to be replaced.,1
3316,These gems are a little bigger than the other gems I have but the case is great and I will reuse it.,4
3317,Came all mangled & are definitely NOT sterling. Would not buy again!,1
3318,Great shaver. Smooth and powerful. Good close shave. Slick design.,5
3319,"I gave it as a gift, they said it was okay",2
3320,This razor is great. It gives a nice clean shave. The cleaning option is also nice. It keeps your razor heads clean and fresh.,4
3321,does a good job. I wish I learned about alum a decade ago.,5
3322,A bit harsher feeling than some mesh sponges Ive used but not uncomfortably so. Does a decent job exfoliating dry skin. Ill use it often.,3
3323,"Fast shipping
Great basic pearls. These are white white NO yellowish tent. Love",4
3324,Advise trying a sample first. It is a very strong cologne that unfortunately I wore once & cannot ever wear again.,4
3325,I love this but after wearing for a while it starts to feel more Matte. But I like it still great red color.,3
3326,It is too thick and it doesn't spread on the skin naturally. I used it only sometimes and I threw it away eventually.,1
3327,Ordered for my husband -  couldn't even  Cut thin soft hair let alone thick beard hair,1
3328,"Works well, only problem is there are too many attachments still learning them",4
3329,"I can only assume these work as I have no way to test, but it definetly gets rid of the Chlorine smell",5
3330,"the wax is horiible and it sticks everywhere you touch it, nothing like a professional wax",1
3331,"2 stars the stand would only hold my razor, the badger would not fit... Boooooooooooo!!!!!!!!",2
3332,Totally satisfied. The best stuff for my facial and body care. you can't beat it for quality and clinical results.,3
3333,Built cheap. I keep hoping the oil doesn't leak. But you get what you pay for.,2
3334,"I like this product but not a real professional type brushes, more for a biginner",4
3335,"Nice color, but didn't last more than 1 day!!! Don't waste your money!!!",1
3336,I have not used it daily to see results but it's smooth design offers coolness on the skin.,4
3337,"I love these when eating foods with high levels of garlic, etc.",4
3338,Nice design. A little awkward with trying to keep water under control in mouth while under higher pressure. But use at mid=level pressure is good,4
3339,BEST facepaint I have ever used. Worth every penny.,5
3340,"I have just started using this product, but it appears to do the job fine so far.",4
3341,"doesnt work so well just takes oil out no blackheads
wouldnt buy it if i were u",2
3342,Kids loved them. I thought they were too small.,4
3343,"I had such high hopes, with the raving reviews. It creases *immediately*, practically creating wrinkles, and does not cover dark circles!",1
3344,This is to shallow for my soap. When working up a lather it runs out onto counter But I like it for keeping my loose change in,3
3345,It's a wonderful clear gloss. Not sure why it was discontinued. It's smooth without being too sticky.,5
3346,These are completely see through and don't protect my eyes at all. I would like a refund,1
3347,Hard to find to find in stores. Still has same classic scent. Bottle is sturdy.,4
3348,Before buying this shaver please prepare yourself to have a trouble with razor heads (HQ8). You'll need to exchange them every 40-60 days.,3
3349,The hand grip is about right in size but the metal shaft should be longer.,3
3350,"Nice size, dual purpose; BUT, I have a lot of hair and find I cant use just one side",4
3351,"They work great.
I love Braun Clean & Renew merchandise product items.
They are what I needed for my razor",5
3352,"I would like to recomend this product as it has been one of the bests I've used ever.
Excelent results obtained!",4
3353,All of them are good except for the white one which for some reason won't work.,4
3354,"Very nice product, it really works! Not only for muscles and joint diconforts, but also for head aches... Nice scent too!",4
3355,"I have used this product 2x now and I am orange and have horrible lines!
 I would NOT recommend this to anyone!",1
3356,Still too recent. But it seems that's working.,4
3357,handy to have around. these fit between tight teeth.,4
3358,I expected a better product for the price that I paid. After applying my face stung and turned red.,1
3359,"Cute and stylish but, the ends scratched my daughter's head.",4
3360,This is a beautiful stylish paper towel holder. I love it. It can hold 3 rolls on he bottom and a fourth one for use.,5
3361,It was perfect for my wedding! I added a border and stones to it.  BEAUTIFUL!!,5
3362,"for dry skin like mine, this is wonderful. feels good on skin, smells good, and gets you clean. wonderful.",5
3363,I have not noticed any improvement after 3 months of use. Trying a different product.,2
3364,"One bottle cap came broken, so it does not hide the acrylic smell.",2
3365,Garbage. Dirty and so small. You get what you pay for.,1
3366,This is not worth buying at all!  It pulls hair and is not very efficient.,1
3367,"I love the creamy, non-greasy feel. My only complaint is that the container is so small for the price.",4
3368,Didn't stay in my head... ended up replacing it.,2
3369,Better than the Persona blades I got last year. They last longer and my face feels smooth after shaving.,5
3370,I don't like this it's too yellow... it's full coverage but the smell is so bad.i got shade #18 and I'm Asian,1
3371,"The vapor really 'pours' out, but I wish the smell would go further and linger longer.",4
3372,My hair was thinning and was looking for a product that would help to regrow and so far it has been working.,4
3373,I love Passionate Kisses.  I have tried many expensive brands of perfumes but nothing compares to this one.,5
3374,Great pick. Works great and I highly recommend it.,4
3375,"I'm a size 10 so it doesn't quite fit me the way i'd like, but it still fits.",4
3376,"I'm surprise that the product is so small in person. It look like a toys, it so small",3
3377,Very difficult to see through eye holes. Couldnt adjust tanning bed,2
3378,"Is this stamping polish or regular polish?
I tried to use as stamping polish, it doesn't work.",1
3379,Doesn't work better off without it and give me a bad breakout on skin wear it was used,1
3380,the brushes are nice and do not shed there are so many! very very nice a great product buy it!,4
3381,"Covers grey roots well, and it feels cleaned not sticky.",4
3382,Realize this comes with 1 brush head.  I'm having trouble convincing my 10 year old to use it...the vibration is apparently a troubling sensation.,4
3383,"I used to like the stingy feel that my last toner would leave me with. Otherwise, it's a good product.",3
3384,The product was fine.  The shipping charges were more than the Dentotape.  I won't order from this source again.,1
3385,"This cocoa butter is okay but, it doesn't do well for my skin. he next time, I'll get something better.",3
3386,My wife likes it. She had one before the finally had a problem.,4
3387,"Absolutely terrible, it's so orange that there's no way to make it appear natural (unless you're Trump, I guess).",1
3388,"Somewhat big, doesn't look like the picture. Soft and comfortable, but wouldn't wear out of the house",3
3389,"I liked this, it looks awesome with my complex. The only upset that I have found so far is that it does dry my lips.",4
3390,This product did not perform as advertised and I would not recommend it.,1
3391,I found this very rough and uncomfortable to use. I trashed it,1
3392,Didn't find that it helped with dry cuticle. Prefer Sally Hansen's Cuticle Rehab.,2
3393,I am a 36 year old with dry-ish skin.  This product dries my skin ever more leaving flakes and lines where applied.  Too bad.,2
3394,This didn't work for me. Still sweating the same amount i was before.,2
3395,I've used these for years.... Hard to find where I live so I orderded online....died sooner than normal... Bummer.,2

3397,made my face really dry and i broke out with acne,1
3398,I was really excited to go no poo but this bar just left my oily hair very greasy and waxy. I was very disappointed.,1
3399,Discoloration of blades observed after four days of use.  No spot to put used blades.,3

3402,Not as soft as I thought inside but it will work for now,3
3403,Wow! Very nice fragrance. Will be back for more.,5
3404,I've been ordering this Olay product from Amazon for years. Love the ease of ordering and receiving!,5
3405,"Even good at cleaning other bathroom nooks & crannies - around faucets, drains & handles. Oh - works on teeth too!",4
3406,Very good cream. Great for someone who suffers with PMS with bloating and breast tenderness.  Will buy again for sure.,5
3407,"Good quality, but they don't have any engraving indicating the width on the rods or on the case",4
3408,I like the small white and blues ones better than the big all blue. I think there should be more smalls toothbrush in the pack.,3
3409,its good as a body wash not a shampoo. leaves a heavy residue in hair.,3
3410,Really wanted to try the new look matte waterproof lipstick but there are times it feels rough on my lips and they smell like paint.,3

3420,They are not 1 size fit all. Little too expensive compare to others.,4
3421,Well worth the purchase. Hours of gameplay can be expected with this one. If you like your shooters give it a go.,4
3422,i like this product i use easier to use then having to file nails down. I'm glad i found ths product. thumbs up,4
3423,Poor quality brush you get what you pay never again . My nieces plays with them now .,1
3424,it did not work on my hair but it's ok for my daughter hair,3
3425,This  should be called a body spray not a perfume. It stinks! yek! and i will not recommend this to anyone,1
3426,True fragrant!  Very strong!  I wound up throwing our the smelly stuff and using the container.,1
3427,"Great product, but it's not built for all day performance, at least for me.  Mitchum makes better deoderant products.",3
3428,Recieved them way earlier then the date . They are so pretty .,4
3429,This thing only worked for a couple months. Not worth the money.,2
3430,"Cuts very different then my old Remington shaver, so use caution on sensitive areas. Otherwise its a very simple unit that seems to cut fairly well.",4
3431,I ordered the 30 count pack and only received the 10 count.,1
3432,I have this in other colors - bought just in case they stop making them!,5
3433,It is not strong enough to do the job. Gets caught between the teeth.,2
3434,Purchased this to hold my father's ashes until we have a family gathering to scatter his ashes.  Very nice quality for a very reasonable price.,5

3437,Great lamp. Our kid loves it. 4 stars because theres no automatic shut off with timer like in other models,4
3438,"Good product, materials are good and it will last a long time. Very stretchy.",4
3439,Makes long days in the Arizona heat not so SWAMPY!!! Thank you Fresh Balls for the dryness and fresh smell.,4
3440,My husband is a chronic snorer.  I have tried everything.  This did nothing for him at all.,1
3441,This dental floss glides very well and is gentle on my wife's gums. This makes for a flossing experience that is not unpleasant.,5
3442,Beautiful and holds the Vikings Blade and Badger Brush great.,5
3443,Sometimes a product is just disappointing. This is one of them. The fragrances are not relaxing or enjoyable. Keep looking for massage oils.,1
3444,Delivery was slow and they are very thick at the nose piece,3
3445,works good.  I dropped it though and it shattered.,4
3446,I don't know if it melted or what but the coco butter was crumbled up out of the stick!,1
3447,it did everything it advertised it would. it does a really good job. I would recommend this to all ages,4
3448,Item came without tubing.  Unvented tube would be preferable for my patient whose hands are nearly unusable.,3
3449,"a lot of gems were missing, but enough remained to make it worth it",4
3450,My kids love them.  I think the stickers could stick a little better but overall great product.,4
3451,I'm in my 40's and still have problems with acne! I use this cleanser along with the Even and Clear Tone Correcting Concentrate.,3
3452,"It moisturizes your skin, but doesn't have any healing properties.",3
3453,"I saw no results at all, it was a waste of my money. Would not recommend or try it again.",1
3454,Great for those times in between colorings. Covers well.,4
3455,"Exactly what I wanted, goes on perfect and the color matches perfectly. It's not overly thick, but only requires 2 coats!",4
3456,The color is fine but darker than expected. Comes off too easily. Does not seem to be very nourishing/moisturizing,3
3457,The belly button ring fell apart 2 days after I recieved it!!,1
3458,I get 3 less than 2 minute shaves on a 24 hour recharge.  Might as well leave it plugged in...  Shaves great,3
3459,The tag itsself is great but the chain is too short.,3
3460,This thing is pretty good. I had one for a very long time before this one and now I reordered since the last one was so good!,4
3461,Did not stick after a week followed care instructions and still didn't work for $25 I'd rather buy a good chest cream,1
3462,I bought this for my life partner and he prefers it over the razor.  They've really improved these electic razors.,4
3463,I would definitely recommend . Smells absolutely wonderful. Many...many compliments  I wear it quite often . Not too potent..excellent,4
3464,"Nice looking, charges well, shaves well.  No electric shaver is as good as a blade, but this is a very good electric shaver!",4
3465,"I use every time I bathe, good to exfoliate my skin not too rough on the skin, as u can see it's been well use",5
3466,"This is not a Essie product. It is fake, color on skin is orange very different from the original one. I am returning it.",1
3467,"The lipstick came damage. As soon as I open it, the bar came out.",1
3468,exact item I buy in Europe at a fair price. I will use this sign to purchase this item again.,5
3469,"These blades are extremely sharp, and at around 10 cents per blade (I paid ~$10), this is a very good deal.",4
3470,"Doesn't work that well for eyebrows, but works amazing for nosehairs and trimming in general. Very pleased with my purcahse.",4
3471,"Dries well, but a little awkward to use....too long.",3
3472,Received product box was open. Looked like it was stepped on hard to believe no one noticed.,1
3473,Great to use while working out to get the sweat flowing,4
3474,Purchased this for my mom and she did not like and said it did not hold her dentures in very well.,2
3475,Love this product. Such a good deal on Amazon.,5
3476,"Sert un peu la tte, et le motif n'est pas tout  fait conforme  la photo.",3
3477,"I don't notice a difference with this, and it's kind of a pain to use.",3
3478,I like it but I thought it was going to be bigger.,4
3479,"Amazing. Thick. Sheds a bit, but since it's so smooth it doesn't matter! I love it:) very shiny as well.",5
3480,Very pleased with it. Makes the skin smooth and reduces pores.,4
3481,This arrived absolutely covered in machine grease.  So unacceptable!  It was returned immediately so I have no ability to comment on the actual product itself.,1
3482,This color accentuates your lip ridges. Like putting foundation on your lips.,2
3483,"Works very well, no complaints other than it's bit overpriced",4
3484,"does not seem to heat up to a high heat at all,not pleased with product much, bought conair after this purchase",2
3485,I bought these because of the price. They are extremely tight which makes them very uncomfortable! I think they are made for smaller faces.,2
3486,It covers well but does leave a bit of a sticky residue.,4
3487,Its good. Bit it could have had more length.,3
3488,I use it for hair glitter as it works great when little ones play dress up rather than use as a mascara.,5
3489,This is the stuff i've been looking for .it do the job and safe .very clear face now .i don't werried about cut my face now,4
3490,It doesn't work! Save money don't buy!,1
3491,Very good product for the money simple but effective I give it 5 stars,5
3492,I liked it but wasn't happy with the alcohol content but it smells geat and isn't too oily so I can use it during the day,3
3493,Nice.  Clean.  Easy application.  I use it on my lids too due to discoloration from daily eye medication.  Covers well.  Recommend.,5
3494,I am not sure it stops itchiness completely but it certainly makes the after swim less chlorinated and less itchy.,4
3495,This ointment healed the stage 2 bedsore quickly.  I would recommend without any hesitation.,5
3496,Review from my wife: first time I purchased a bikini trimmer. It works ok but nothing special. Would try a different brand next time.,3
3497,Love this block easy to hold on too does the job and won't slip out of your hands as easy as the others,5
3498,New to ths  type of shaving so I thought I'd give it a try. So far the blades have expectations.,4
3499,Cool to have when you're in clutch mode....Cuts haircut time in half.,3
3500,"The shampoo is very watery, and I did not see too much of a difference in my dandruff.",2
3501,"MAY BE GOOD , BUT I COULDN'T USE IT CAUSE I WAS SKEPTIC OF CHEMICAL IN IT.",1
3502,Compared to standard glide this floss breaks much more easily.,3
3503,These have lasted me about 2 months. The toner smells amazing. Does not replace dark spot corrector but helps.,4
3504,They work fine. No problems with them fitting in air floss.,3
3505,Has small little pieces of white clumps in it . Product must have been out of temperature or old. Not pleased with quality.,1
3506,They are great for the price! Very professional packaging and even comes with a free gift! (great Eye shadow primer!),3
3507,it was a little bit smaller than i thought it would be but overall i loved it,4
3508,"Great overall blades. Could be sharper like feather's blades.
For an everyday type of blade, these do well.",4
3509,Very noisy... sounds like a motorcycle coming down the road. But it does not leak like my old one so I can live with it 4 now..,3
3510,This is a gift to my dad. He haven't tried this one yet. But the last one I got him last year was quite good.,4
3511,it's too big. I should have bought a smaller version.  Now I have to try and dump it at a garage sale.,1
3512,"It's a decent dogtag, but the chain is not long enough. If I wanted a choker, I would've bought one.",3
3513,"It stopped working after a few uses. There are way better trimmers out there,",1
3514,"It works, but not as wide as the floss I was replacing.",4
3515,"they are hard and they don't stay on my eyes very well, next time I will try some that are flexible",3
3516,Product arrived promptly and seems to do its job fairly well (bought to use with Sirius 77 Aurora Light Therapy System).,4
3517,"The container was a lot smaller than it looks in the pic, No bigger than my hand really. Perfect for a teenage girl.",3
3518,It really stays but overpriced. Works on silicon nu bras.,3
3519,"I first thought these were too expensive. After seeing my son playing with I was very surprised with the quality and durability, simply great!",5
3520,Little disappointed cap was not tight and oil leaked in the box and in the bag.,3
3521,"I called about the problem, no one returned my call.
I wanted Hesperides (in the picture).
You sent me Hesperides Grapefruit.",3
3522,"I Purchased these after talking to others that used them. Wish I had done this years ago.
Just wish that they had some larger.",5
3523,Works fine. But too expensive and there are cheaper ones out there to do the same job. and good quality.,4
3524,"Soap is OK, and just that.  The cleansing unit is small and rough on one side, and simply plastic on the other.  Really disappointing.",1
3525,It's too flimsy. My tablet wouldn't stay in the corner tabs.,2
3526,Hard to blow up hurt my ears after a while so I just didn't worry about it when I was going to use it,4
3527,"Very smooth and quick shaving, much better than thers on the market. it is a pity that it is not available anywhere in Europe...",5
3528,I thought conditioner was going to leave my hair really smooth but it was the other way around.  My hair looks and feels horrible.,1
3529,good design and I like it because it fits the dress that is going to be used the wedding on that day,4
3530,I really like this bulb and have noticed some differences in the finer lines on my face. Happy Customer.,4
3531,"Con: Drying.

Pro: Lightens the skin and pretty much stays that way for the most part...
Does not bleach your hands.",4
3532,Wish they lasted longer and for some reason shipping is always delayed.,4
3533,Not worth the trouble to deal with all of the water coming out of your mouth.,2
3534,"This foot file is good as a finishing, smoothing touch after heavy duty foot scrubber. Just by itself it won't take care of calluses.",4
3535,Shaped strangely and not flexible or soft as I expected.,2
3536,these are really nice. smaller then i expected but nice. my daughter and i use them almost all the time.,5
3537,Works great for short straight hair that needs curl or body.  It does  not slip off the roller.  Works well for me.,4
3538,"Good quality, but make sure to order two as they don't come in a set, this is the price of one himo.",4
3539,After trying this I ended up with Bunions and have reported this product,1
3540,There is no review. I said I like it. Why do I have to waste time when I said I like it.,4
3541,One of the best things I have ever purchased. Requires a little more time when shaving in the neck area.,5
3542,Love this stuff. My skin gets SO clean and soft. So glad I found it.,5
3543,"This works ""OK"". I probably will look for a different product next time.",3
3544,Lipstick is OK but has  one .moisture  and had to keep reapplying,3
3545,I have a Finally Free for sale that was never used and I can't remember how much I paid for it. Does anyone have a price?,2
3546,not real powerful but does great if you let your hair almost dry before styling.,4
3547,Picture showed a grown woman wearing it and it barely fit my six year old. Arrived in excellent condition.,3
3548,"This is a very good product and good buy, but I wish Waterpik would include more than one standard pik with the product.",4
3549,This razor makes shaving much easier - shaving in the shower is great - not as close as a regular razor - but close enough.,4
3550,This works great! Its sticky until it dries but it really keeps things in place.,4
3551,"The piece I received is very cheap quality. It was chipped and crooked when I opened the package, so it does not set right.",1
3552,"This was very cheap feeling, did not heat up very hot.  It did nothing on my coarse hair.  Returned it immediately.",1
3553,"I still use it, but it never rotated.  It does smooth my hair and give it fullness.  Good for second day hair.",3
3554,My favorite! Great price plus two free samples:),5
3555,Was not happy with this product. Received multiple colors & a few stones had fallen out in shipping. And later more stones fell out,1
3556,do not use for people with small necks. Does not secure properly.,2
3557,"Just wish they hadn't changed the formula and scent from
The previous product
Melaleuca s French milled soap.  I loved that a lot",4
3558,Ordered the 6 pack but only got 1 hopefully I can get this resolved.,1
3559,"gives you a great, deep sleep - but otherwise I saw no difference.",2
3560,They all smell yummy come in an adorable little pouch got as a gift for my girlfriends little girl,5
3561,"Says this is a 3 pack, but I only received 2 lenses",1
3562,Doesn't Work . I was told that essay oils sold on amazon were fake and not real.,1
3563,"The clasp is not black as shown, but rather a milky white color, but still works great.",4
3564,"Great razors at a low price.  These seem to last for quite some time before needing replaced, which is nice.",4
3565,The product works wonderfully for mu husband! The service is as good as the quality! Highly recommended . . .,5
3566,Love the scent! Easy to apply. Just wait 15 seconds and you're ready for a super gliding shave!,5

3568,"It gives me energy, helps me control weight gain to some extent and makes me look not so haggard.",3
3569,It's super cute and I totally recommend it! I fell in love as soon as i seen it!,5
3570,cute earrings.  Arrived early.  I little big but I still like them a lot.,4
3571,Not as strong/long lasting as Super Poligrip but pretty good.,4
3572,"Great product!  Wouldn't be without it!

Love these tapes!!!!  Amazing!! . Thank you!!",5

3575,"Good coverage, just hate the feel on my head and cannot wear light colored headbands, color comes off on hair accessories.",4
3576,Plenty of cleaning tips. Durable. Keep tank dry or bear smells.,4
3577,I Love this stuff. I have very sensitive skin and this feels real good.,5
3578,Best price on the market for OEM Braun.  Don't waste time or money on aftermarket look alike replacements!,5
3579,Love the way it smells and how my hair feels =),4
3580,The rhinestones fell off so quick an the bal on the end isn't big,1
3581,Doesn't shave as well as previous brands. try going with something else. I'm stuck with 100 of these for a while.,3

3583,First week I had this brush it fell apart in my hands!  Wouldn't buy another one,1
3584,Came quick! Nice for price and nicely pigmented I received exactly what was said!!!,4
3585,Very happy with my purchase. The shipment was prompt considering it was from out of the country.,5
3586,It was an exact replacement for my generator battery. The non-Reverse Polarity batteries would have required modifications to the wiring.,5
3587,"I used it, but everyone in my family told me they hated it.",1
3588,"soft and clean up all body. can use bar or liquid soap, feel so clean after bath. and also long life",4
3589,"Yes, the sore tooth feels better, but I can no longer taste food.  Not worth the trade off.  I want my taste buds back.",1
3590,"These were a little oddly shaped and kinda flimsy, but they worked for what they were purchased for,",4
3591,"I selected the eggplant, goldenrod and teal trio. I love them and they will look good with my  Birkenstocks. Thanks, Maggie!",5
3592,"Easy to apply, but other version that you melt and apply works so much better.",2
3593,It's ok.  Not sure that it is all they say it is.  Still working with it.,4
3594,"Definitely thought I w as getting more for my money herebut this is not the case, these are just what I thought CHEAP",1
3595,Good product it works!!! Thanks Debra!!!,5
3596,Outstanding product! My girls have always liked it and always ask for it for Christmas.  It was well packed and delivered on time for Christmas.,5
3597,It is a fine cleaner and massager at the gum line but I still feel I need to floss between my teeth.,2
3598,This is ridiculous I have been using this product for a while and usually the can is full this that I ordered isn't even half full,1
3599,The containers were smaller than expected but they worked good.,3
3600,It what I needed and saved me from buying a new razor,5
3601,i used this ABS for about 3 weeks then i found small pieces of glass other than the glass i really liked this product,1
3602,"Feels badly designed.
Button to stop water outlet is wrong, should be button to eject jet of water.
Faulty after 4 months.",1
3603,the shipping was fast but it came in very dirty and the lid was for a different foundation shade because light shade foundation was all over the lid,3
3604,"Good buy.
This holds enough liquid to thoroughly claen your teeth, and has every attachment conceivable",4
3605,"I was disappointed that the tape did not stick!  I reordered for the swimmer's thigh lifts, and  pleased that everything stayed stuck.",3
3606,"I feel my skin much, much better. I'm going to review the web site of this cream for looking more creams.",4

3608,The extensions were not at all as thick I thought they would be. I basically wasted money because I'm not able to wear them.,2
3609,This my second time purchasing. It's the only thing that makes my makeup last in the NYC heat!,4
3610,I am a NARS fan and I love this blush! Terrific color! Use it every morning and it stays all day.,5
3611,They r extremely short. The whole order does not add up to a regular one full size,1
3612,Huge jar.. Think a blue magic hair grease jar.  It works wonders on skin and best for tattoos in my opinion,5
3613,"The skull is on paper and was very pale, and glue showed through the paper.  It is just ok, chain should be longer.",2
3614,I really don't kn about this product yet i am still using..not even half way through the jar yetso i will let you all kn if it works..,2
3615,Love it !!!! It actually came early!,5
3616,"I have no clue how to properly wear it other than that, once I figure it out I'm sure I'll love it",4

3618,"I was afraid it may be made cheaply, but I was pleased it is real, sturdy metal with a decent chain.",4

3623,"I had a Conair one for years, needed a new one. This is mediocre at best.",3
3624,Does not fit the Merkur double sided razor. Returning them sadly.,1
3625,"8 year old seems to like it, my 4 year old i thinks its a little much for him right now. good brush though",4

3627,"They are only okay, not nearly as good as others I've had.",3

3629,"This was so small for me, they sent me a baby kufi hat.",1
3630,Absolutely believe in this product.  Such a simple Serum that will enhance my skin,5
3631,Can't wear as a necklace or a bracelet. It's too coiled up.,3
3632,"Sometimes these do not stick as well I would like, but they usually fit the need.",3
3633,This does not last 30 days.  Way to expensive for such a short amount of use.,1
3634,This is some kind of awesome product. It shines your hair and you feel the quality.,5
3635,Creamy and nice to use.  I think it was a little pricey.,3
3636,"it doesn't work. it has the same effect as lotion, moisture.",1
3637,Too short for me. Prefer something longer. But well made and arrived discretely and in good condition.,4
3638,"if shave every day this is great,but if every other day,have to go over areas of the face twice",4
3639,It goes on easy and there is no foundation look it looks natural,4
3640,"for me the space between should be longer it does not really work well for me
but of course better than nothing",3
3641,"Ive purchased a couple times now, feels nice and smooth, doesnt feel heavy and keeps a nice tan glow on my face",4
3642,"Based off other reviews that I've read I expected a little easier shaving from this product, but it's not bad for the price.",4
3643,good looking and stable. holds my razor and brush with no issues. fast shipping and well packaged. would do repeat business,5
3644,The price is what kept me from buying it sooner .. now that I have I'm hooked,5
3645,Made a horrible rash on my face. I have used other Neutrogena sunscreens and never had a problem. If you have sensitive skin skip this one.,1
3646,It does not have smell but it feels cool when you put it on .,3
3647,"Works fine. Nothing fancy, but for the price I think it is pretty good.",4
3648,Outstanding product! My girls have always liked it and always ask for it for Christmas.  It was well packed and delivered on time for Christmas.,5
3649,We use these every day.  Our dentist is happy with result.  Quality product; holds up for years.,5
3650,Just not as good as the similar Remington it replaced. The only thing I like better with the Norelco is that it's quieter than the Remington.,3
3651,item is small...  its probabaly meant for small books like children's.,3
3652,Cumbersome to use.  Would have been better in a tube.,3
3653,The plastic container was broken and I only received 10-15 gems of each color I was expecting at least half full containers and not broken merchanidse,1
3654,Good human hair. It sheds a whole lot though. Wish it shed less other than that it's good.,4
3655,Didn't work at all... just made a mess.,1
3656,"I always trust this line of hair product. Works in every situation, and lasts all day!",5
3657,Good quality.  Sturdy build.  Not an every day tool as it makes the skin a little rough.,3
3658,I've had three and will not recommend buying.  The coiled line keeps springing a leak making it useless.,2
3659,Some of the studs are off place but I guess it's what you pay for ehh,4
3660,No matter how much pumping we do it does not dispense any alcohol. We were very disappointed in this product.,1
3661,Way to greasy - just like Vaseline!  Next time I will buy Vaseline at the cheaper price.,1
3662,I am very disappointed in this product. Battery does not last at all. The shave is not close and takes forever.,2
3663,"Not scented like apricot, which I was hoping for. Not very great.",2
3664,Nice color.  Easy to apply.  But doesn't last as long as I had hoped.,4
3665,We order these regularly.  Price is what keeps us coming backl.,5
3666,I love it! I wish the conditioner was still available,5
3667,"It worked as describe once it is used properly.  Especially in cleaning between  braches, however one need to work with it slowly",4
3668,There so fun to use and got them pretty fast just disappointed that there wasn't as many diamonds as in the picture they show,3
3669,Don't buy it Ik they only cost like $2 but so cheap looking not even worth it,1
3670,"what is not to like about this stuff,,wonderful in the shower,,good size bottle and good price,,",5
3671,"Super great  coverage,but the color was sooooooooooooo light did not look any thing like the name or the color on line .",4
3672,"The smell is amazing and makes just the right of bubbles, after taking bath my skin felt smooth and hydrated, very satisfied",4
3673,I thought it would be bigger but it still keeps all my little things in one spot and I don't have to dig for my lipstick.,4
3674,IT WAS WAYYYYY SMALLER THAN EXPECTED!!!!! Way way Smaller.,3
3675,"this waterpik is amazing ,i don't know why i waited so long to get one, its great. i love them",5
3676,For the price ok but have had better but again can't complain for the price..,3
3677,Bought this from my local pharmacy to treat my eczema! Very effective. My eczema was cleared within a week. I would suggest using this nightly.,5
3678,"kind of a weak spring, but otherwise a great product",4
3679,"Product was okay, but not what I was hoping for",3
3680,Save your money. This is nothing but a copycat root concealer at a ridiculous price!,1
3681,Easy to use.  Gets the job done well and easily.,4
3682,The scent is wonderful and it is the creamiest soap I have ever used.,5
3683,It clearly states there are 4 but I only received 1! I feel like I got ripped off -,1
3684,"Product is great, however the lid was broken, I didn't return it due to the lid, I just taped it together",4
3685,Wasnt purple.  Wasnt the same as on the package. Look like it was OK,1
3686,its oily but makes my face soft after wearing it over night i love the orange smell,4
3687,"I like the battery powered flosser better but it doesn't last that long.
I would also like stronger water pressure.",4
3688,Not what I expected.  Heat not sufficient to curl.  Would never buy again.,1
3689,It hurt my ear really bad. It's pointy. I don't like it.,1
3690,Love this product! I use as a night cream and wake up with a soft refreshed feeling.,5
3691,1st shipment in 4Q16 was good.  Blades from second shipment  are good for only two shaves.,2
3692,My daughter loves the flavor. Makes flossing a bit easier.  She also loves the different animal shapes that they come in.,4
3693,Bought for my wife. Easy to use with one hand.,4
3694,"Bought this for a friend who waxes eyebrows, she loved it and says she wants to buy the bigger version",5
3695,"Terrible, receive product not the same as the one in picture. Just a cape. They can not pick up the right order.",1
3696,Good value for quality/vial capacity. The skin is not irritated.,4
3697,I've only used the trimmer a few times but I am pleased with it so far.  Easy to use and very light.  Nice!,4
3698,I was thinking I could just leave it on a key but you can't put the key on a key chain with this gadget on the key.,2
3699,"Not very sharp, doesn't work very well for hangnails or cuticle trims as described.",2
3700,I like the original formula better than the newest versions.,4
3701,"Looks sharp, seems well constructed. Owned for 2-3 weeks.",5
3702,I am very happy with my recent purchase of the Waterpik and use it at least twice a day and it does a terrific job.,5
3703,Nice product - felt good in the skin.  Refreshing!,4
3704,"This brush set is perfect. Will last for a very long time and with so many different sizes, you won't need anything else!",4
3705,"Best new growth concealer available.  While it covers the gray, it also rubs off on your clothes/collars and stains pillow cases. Ugh!",4
3706,I love the barber jacket only thing is I never ordered it,4
3707,It works great when you have a minor cut on the skin and spray on the wounded area. It stops irritation very quick.,4
3708,They where cool a little snug but they do stretch really sexy they bring a lot of fun to your outfit,3
3709,Owning a Braun shaver is no cheap deal.  Item seems costly but does the job it is supposed to do.,3
3710,The razor side of the stand is a bit 'small'.  It's functional.,4
3711,its a good product. but not worth the money for me.,4
3712,"This product feels great going on, but the feeling is short-lived.  It only seems to moisturize for a couple of hours.",4
3713,I've had these since May 2015 and was very pleased until recently when they fell apart.,2
3714,It's was very pretty but too big for what I was looking for....,3
3715,I live in Seattle. Shipping took far too long. Product was good though.,3
3716,This is not what we expected in performance. It doesn't pump up enough or hold the vacuum as was anticipated by us.,2
3717,"Works great, love that you can just change the AA batteries and don't have to worry about charging it",4
3718,"Socks were as described, and were well packed for the shipping process. Everything arrived safely and on time.",5
3719,Does what it is supposed to do with no pulls.  The foil part will let you get a very close shave.,4
3720,"I like the smell and it really does help with tangles, but I bought it for static and it doesn't help at all.",3
3721,"While I do like it, it came broken. How does that happen so often?",4
3722,I read the reviews and decided to try this. Im not sure how to store it so it doesnt dry out or get moldy.,3
3723,This stuff smells great but does very little for hair growth in the short-term. Long-term? Who knows. Probably doesn't work.,2
3724,"Great. Makes my skin soft, doesn't burn. JO chEMICALS. Not are about the anti aging effects.",4
3725,I Had a hard time getting the right color I ordered twice and was to light for me.,2
3726,"I like this product.  It shaves closer than the one with the three circles.  It's a bit noisy, but I don't mind.",4
3727,Bought a six pack and only received one! Scam!,1
3728,Not firm enough to keep toes separated. Would prefer a firmer or larger piece to keep and hold the toes apart.,2
3729,Haven't tried all the recipes but so far this product is amazing. Definitely a great buy.,4
3730,A tad sharper than the Shark safety razors but last about the same for me.,4
3731,Very important piece of equipment to complement a well cleaned mouth,5
3732,Smells wonderful and feels so nice on dry skin in the winter.  Love it.,5
3733,This is the best foot care cream I have ever used. Leaves your feet soft. Not too greasy,5
3734,"If I could give a negative review I would, these do not work at all and are a complete waste of money.",1
3735,"Smells great after spraying it on my sheets but the fragrance quickly dissipates. By bedtime, I smell nothing. ",1
3736,Very Disappointed.  Didnt work and hardly any product in the tube . Shame !,1
3737,good trimmer. Shaver doesn't shave in areas near chin as well as i would have liked. Overall I'm happy with it.,4
3738,"I am sure I bought a ointment for baby,but I received a different one,adult one!",4
3739,Eh it was ok it dyed my hair pretty good but it left the hair. Really dry but I would use it again,3
3740,"Very nice looking stand and has a heavy duty construction that is just the right size, without taking up too much counter space. Would recommend.",5
3741,Nice smell and moisturizer. Will give it a few weeks to help with stretch marks and update,4
3742,My brushes are over a month late and I'm starting to get really impatient because everything else that I ordered came in but my brushes didn't.,1
3743,"Nice brushes, but some of them had come unglued from the handles, so I just glued them myself.  Easy fix.  Good for the price.",3
3744,The bottle cap was open and everthing in the box stinks,1
3745,"I use these gloves for UV protection while driving.  They are a little big, but do the job just fine.",4
3746,Love the different colors just wish it had the little ball at the end to keep them from falling out so easily,4
3747,I would have loved to try this product but unfortunately the product which arrived did not match the picture or the description.,1
3748,"It's has more of an orange tint than what I was expecting, but overall a nice color.",4
3749,"The product is excelent and has definetly met my expectations , but the packaging is way to big for such a small product",4
3750,"Great price, smells good, you can tell it's good quality. I will order again, I use it on my hair and face",5
3751,"I like the variable water pressure and the mulitiple picks. I use this at least 2 times a day, love itl",4
3752,The chrome razor stand is value for money. It's compact and well suited for limited space. The faux chrome finished looks elegant.,4
3753,It's Ugly ugly ugly uglyyyyyyy ..Don't buy!!,1
3754,Product took over 2 weeks from date of purchase to be delivered.  Product was as described and pictured and it works okay.,3
3755,The re-formulated version is too thick for the squeeze bottle. I have to completely remove the lid to use the product.,4
3756,My daughter had this for my grandson. I loved the scent and moisturizing qualities so much I bought it for myself,5
3757,Basically it's peroxide and water with a fancy name - does work well tho,3
3758,"The perfect sharpness for my beard.  I save a lot of money by using a double-edge razor with these blades, and get a better shave.",5
3759,"Excellent colors, I get many compliments on how good I look and it has the other shade for when I tan!",5
3760,i didn't like the way they're made ! they cut on a angle !,2
3761,It does lengthen but ends of lashes don't look natural. I may not be using it correctly so when I change mascara I will try again,2
3762,It was very hard to get the batteries in.  It's better than nothing but not by much.,1
3763,Can't wait to start a doily.  The book is new as promised. Will buy from you again! *****,5
3764,works great for my trouser socks. keeps them from rolling down,5
3765,It is nice trimmer and it can be washed with anti bacterial after the use. Definitely worth for the price.,4
3766,"Great blades, not too sharp as to cause bumps or burn.",4
3767,Electric shaver brush arrived sooner than expected. Item appears to be well made and cleans the shaver cutter block of  my Braun  Series 5 shaver very well.,5
3768,"Love love love it! Does its job just as described, easy to handle, and easy to clean.",4
3769,My youngest has eczema.  This product is our holy grail.,5
3770,"Pretty good only last like 3 shaves
But they are cheap",3
3771,Started coming undone after one week.  The dove brand are much better quality.,2
3772,I originally wrote that the mirror was not as clear as I had Hoped. It helps when you take the protective film off. LOL,4
3773,"put a ton of soap on it, and after rubbing your arm there is no more soap

should be bigger cause a man is bigger than a women",1
3774,"This was the best of all the Axe line, and they discontinued it. I wish they would bring it back. :(",5
3775,Now I can do my haircut by myself. Everything is as expected. A little bit noisy and flimsy but I was warned by other reviewers.,4
3776,"I don't know what to say, other than I can't really use this because it smells like cheese. Literally, like cheese.",1
3777,I get a good shave & it last as long as my Gilette's.,4
3778,Very cute stickers but hard to separate sticker from backing and they tear easily but over all very cute and I got lots of compliments,3
3779,Ok. I like the size. Not the best piece I've gotten for cheap.,3
3780,"Bottle doesn't spray very well, especially upside down which is how they say to apply it. Bummer.",3
3781,"The product did make my skin smoother,however, I am 69 years old and my wrinkles must be too far gone for this product to be effective",3
3782,Would be great if plastic stand did not pull your hair,2
3783,"They look nice however, I ordered black and received pink otherwise would have given 5 stars.",3
3784,Lots of space to stash your makeup. The lock is very chintzy. Don't expect it to work at all.,3
3785,"great quality and vibrant colors
have ordered all the rest of the bundles",5
3786,"I use this all the time.  Bought a cheap desk lamp with a bendable neck, and it is a good way to direct the bulb.",4
3787,Love mineral makeup! The sample kit is a bit messy though.,4
3788,Great product!  It allows me to color my hair much less frequently!,5
3789,"I found that this shaver gave a very poor shave, particularly on the neck where the cutting heads cou;ldn't cut the outstandind hairs",1
3790,My daughter loved it. For the first two months that it worked. All the colored lights started going or not long after using.,2
3791,If I new this shaver would last less than 3 months I never would have bought it.  Good luck figuring out the warranty BS!,1
3792,These are terrible.  They are so narrow that they barely cover the eyes and they do not stay on.  Not a good universal fit.,1
3793,I love it! So easy! Wish the white was more pigmented! But I love it!,4
3794,Great reviews from others... Didnt stay sharp and cutting was very difficult.,3
3795,This item is overpriced. I purchased it and then found it cheaper at the local beauty supply store. I don't recommend,3
3796,"Not as good as others I've used, but not bad.",4
3797,dental hygenist recommened trying this because I have a hard time flossing.  this is a great alternative or addition to flossing,4
3798,Great cleanser. Washes off well with no residue. Hard to find in stores consistently.,5
3799,Material average quality which is what you will get for the price. Some hair still fell off yo the floor. It gets the job done.,4
3800,Delivery speed of the product is easy to use and effective,5
3801,"Plz plz plz don't buy this if u want nice makeup , it doesn't do what it say it do",1
3802,"Because I think these product is good ,but don't work,I hate too much smel so bad ,I don't spect the any woman like",1

3804,My husband was not able to use these without cutting himself.,1
3805,This product cause my son to have a rash  and he only has to wear a patch for 4 hours a day.,1
3806,Not for me but YMMV. The smell in the bottle was better than on the skin.,3
3807,they are really pigmented however the pallets that i got look every cheap not like the picture i guess you get what you pay for.,3
3808,They are good I love the colors that is for sure.,4
3809,Very nice looking and seems to be well made.  Matches my Merkur razor nicely.  Fits my old school brush as well...,4
3810,"Bang for your buckk... It just doesnt come with shading needles but f*** It, buy it anyway",4
3811,Very pretty. DECREE is a brand that sells the piece at JC Penny. It costs 10 what I paid.,5
3812,Good. It would work on simple tooth aches. But not major ones.,3
3813,When I put it on... I looked dead.. it does not look like the color in the picture I saw... was so excited too :(,1
3814,You do not receive this in a spray topped bottle as pictured.,3
3815,Good product the person I bought it for loves it.,4
3816,there are too many attachments.  The main water pic attachment is all I need.  the six other attachments are dust collectors.,4
3817,"I like it alot better than jam. But sometimes it leaves a white appearance that takes a few hours to absorb, apply lightly.",4
3818,"If you have a large head it will take a while to stretch out, other than that its great.",4
3819,"These are so sharp, I really like them!

These are the sharpest blades I have ever used.",5
3820,"I have used other  products that were much better.  This one did not stay in place.
It was not very comfortable either.",2
3821,My hands get rough from frequent washing...this softens them right up!,5
3822,"It is a beautiful tiara. However, one gem fell off the first time I wore it. otherwise, it is stunning.",4
3823,Very happy with this product and the price was great!!,4
3824,"For the price, it's definitely not worth it.  This product gives no more volume than less expensive products.  Save your money.",3
3825,Works well but is very loud so if you have roommates or close neighbors keep that in mind,4
3826,good blade not as sharp or aggressive as feather but better for sensitive skin. also is much cheaper.,4
3827,"Very cheaply made, broke as soon as my daughter put it on.",1
3828,"I have thick hair and this stuff will hold and last all day. Also works for mustaches and beards. Easy to use, nice odor.",5
3829,..... is using this gizmo on a daily basis.  Dunno what took me so long to get one  (dentist's suggestion).,5
3830,Product doesn't seem bad. Only used it once or twice since I got it but it is deceivingly small.  Soap is even smaller than its packaging,3
3831,I love it my skin feels soft and no breakout from the 2 weeks I've been using it,4
3832,"After only a few weeks of use, all the bristles are breaking off....what a waste of my time and money...",1
3833,Only four stars because of the cost. I still keep buying it anyway because I like it!,4
3834,"Not sure how long it takes to see any results but I haven't seen ""any"" yet... I've been using this product for a week",3
3835,"Really expensive for a teeny container... Wasn't anything miraculous to me, tried on two babies, and didn't seem to help at all.",1
3836,"A great find!  Is much better than vasoline, serves the same purpose only better.",5
3837,It works okay but left my hair feeling sort of weird. Not as soft as I like my hair too feel.,4
3838,"They aren't the best by a long shot. I know they are the cheap, disposable kind, but I did expect better from this brand.",2
3839,"If you have curly hair or hair full of volume and thickness, I recommend not getting this, you won't be able to see them easily.",3
3840,"Love this thing. However, this is NOT a double package. You only get one unit!!",4
3841,Cuts good. Vibrates too much. Really sharp. Heavy.,3
3842,Try these if you want but I can't get as good a shave with less irritation when compared to the feather blades.,3
3843,"Very flimsy, put together backwards, not even able to use. Don't waste your money.",1
3844,given as a replacement gift for a friend that lost hers,4
3845,The posts and backs of these earrings were odd. Not like normal posts. I never wore them.,1
3846,"works !! kills the smell, for what I need it for..",4
3847,It's easy to use and worth every penny. It was suggested by our dentist and she noticed thedifference in our oral health,5
3848,Not the true colors at all. I purchased 2 pair and they are like color tinted.,1
3849,Only need to use a little of it.  Great value!,4
3850,"it does the trick, still leaves some irritation sometimes...this is a newer version of one i had for many years.",4
3851,Goes on so soft and smooth! Coverage isn't great but I like it for everyday use.,4
3852,"Did not last more than 4 hrs. Cheap product, get what you pay for.",1
3853,This product really irritated my skin. I wasn't able to use it long enough to find out if it worked.,2
3854,They are very small so make sure you know that before ordering!,3
3855,"Beautiful colors, not thick enough for stamping, yet its stamping polish? Hmm",3
3856,"It is what I was looking for, but quite pricy to say the least.",4
3857,It does make my feet feel better but does not seem to be absorbed well.  It is 41% pentrolatum so being greasy is to be expected.,4
3858,"Great product. It softens my natural hair, adds shine and an excellent smell. It can get a bit greasy",4
3859,Kinda pricey.  But this is part of a nice electric tooth brush that keeps the kids interested in dental hygene.,4
3860,Find it very noisy and awkward to use. It does do the job of getting all that food out of crevices.,3
3861,Liked it well enough to buy a second one to keep  as spare.,4
3862,Surprisingly easy to spill the liquid when you insert it into the cleaner.  I guess you don't have any other options though.,3
3863,I like the hot air brush however there seems to be a trick to not getting it stuck. I'm hoping practice will prevail. ;),4
3864,It feels weird and doesn't seem to do much.,2
3865,WAS MISSING ONE THING MY ORIGIONAL TUB HAD BUT IS STILL NICE JUST GOOEY.,3
3866,Removed guard for most of my shaving. Leaves a wee bit of stubble. But sooooo easy to use and very maneuverable in hard to reach areas.,4
3867,I guess my pores are to clogged for this to suck my work on my face,3
3868,This product did nothing for my hair. There was no difference when i used it or not.,2
3869,Wished that this product had the original ingredients as before.,4
3870,Adorable and inexpensive. It arrived faster than it was estimated.,5
3871,"Makes hair soft, silky, and shiny. Not too heavy on hair.",4
3872,"Looks like it was used, does not get as hot as a normal one of this brand",2
3873,Seems to be somewhat damaged.  The old set worked much better,1
3874,"Best product, I would be willing to pay many times the price for something that actually works (rather than some sort of half awkward job)",5
3875,"The fingers look creepier than other practice hands.  Otherwise, it does it's job of being a plastic hand.",4
3876,I use this after Joico Color Balance Purple Shampoo Plus Conditioner 10.1 oz. - Good combo in my book!,4
3877,They are kinda flimsy compared to ones I've had before but they get the job done so no complaints here,3
3878,Designs to small to see in person and to hard to use.  Waste of money on my part - do not recommend,1
3879,Not as good as the XL version. but it is a nice gloss so my wifes says. she gave the rest of it to a friend.,3
3880,"love this bubble bath,love all avon bubble bath,lathers great and smells great",5
3881,My favorite sleep mask ever. Love it!!!,5
3882,These are amazing! Felt great the day after and would definitely recommend,5
3883,"Works well enough. Gets about 90%, haven't had any issues with irritation or chemical burns leaving it on for 10 min.",4
3884,I should have bough this years ago. Its a better shave and cheaper than buying the over priced stuff at the drug store.,4
3885,It is made very cheaply material even for the price it's still too expensive for its quality,1
3886,Good price but the Velcro and string to secure around neck is not sufficient and should be lengthened,3
3887,Good product helps fight off basic illnesses. Also helpful when traveling on airlines. My kids use inner defense product too.,4
3888,haven't used very long yet only a few times so far but I think it is nice,4
3889,"This gel became very gelatinous in its consistency, and became hard to use. Smells good though. Not great as kids shampoo.",1
3890,"Great product. Help alleviate my gum pain. Does the job, worth every dollars. Thank you",4
3891,"Color doesn't last long, and I was also sent the wrong product for one item. Wouldn't order again.",1
3892,"These picks tend to bend easily and are a bit too small, I don't think they're nearly as good as the Rotadent Rota-Point Interdental Cleaners .",3
3893,This is the BEST! You'll see a difference immediately after you use it.,5
3894,I like the product but when i recived it it was leaking all over the package.,3
3895,"Excellent other than price. But I guess I'm paying for ""convenience"" and ""brand""",4
3896,It was ok. Had to glue one piece on that fell off when I was screwing it together.,4
3897,"This is easy to use, smells great, leaves no gross residue!",4
3898,The bristles are firm yet soft enough to scrub without being painful. So far the base has withstood mild soaking and being dried afterward without noticeable wear.,4
3899,my greandaughter uses these for her nails and she just loves the colors and shapes they work really great and look great too,5
3900,These things turned my finger green they are not sterling silver,1
3901,"Decidly average, bought a 100 pack, nowhere near as good as Feather blades. They were adequate but that is it.",3
3902,"This shampoo cleans my hair well, lathers well, and smells good.",5
3903,"He was excited, but when he wore then the clasp in the back would come off and the tie would just fall off. Very disappointing!!",1
3904,"Only had it for a week or so but works great so far.  Good design, wireless which is great, and fairly quiet. more to come",4
3905,"Does exactly what it says. I had to go over spots more than once, but overall satisfied!",4
3906,"It works, a bit too big, like all these devices, it takes time and effort to use properly. Easier than flossing.",4
3907,I love this product! I will be ordering it again!,4
3908,"Just the right ""order size"" - about 2 months supplies!",5
3909,"Works great, only wish ingredients were on the package.....",4
3910,"Very thoughtful for philips to create these heads in different color for each user. Now, if only I could order them in specific colors....",4
3911,"Very nice lotion, I use it on my face and no more rosacea or dry flaky spots.",5
3912,"The queen is using it every morning, and seems to be pleased with the results so far.",4
3913,I like My cover! It will keep my Ipod touch safe and secure. I like the black cover silicone case.,4
3914,This product didn't work for me .... I got red rashes on my face after using this. I'm going to have to return it.,1
3915,It is what I expected for this price. Does its job. Good choice for men who do not love razors.,4
3916,I have never seen a small book stand like this. It is almost as big as a mini I pad.i don't recommend it to any one.,1
3917,Would have been nicer if all the brushes weren't small. But still cute and the brushes are great.,4
3918,Coffee color is not as bright/prominent as the picture is.  It is ok.,2
3919,My daughter like the toothbrush and it is not noisy. Compact head works well than standard for nine years old child.,5
3920,"Works better than I expected, Very pleased with thlis purchase. The cleaning tank is a nice accessory, as is the hair trimmer.",4
3921,I like the scent only 3 stars because it don't last very long,3
3922,Love my scissors!!  So easy to use!!,5
3923,"I' am looking forward to my purchase. Just received my bottle. Works really well after first use skin is looking better, thanks.",4
3924,"Cute color but doesn't glow under black light, which is why I bought this brand",2
3925,Kids love them (5&7) fighting over who goes first. I will see what the dentist says before I give them a 5.,4
3926,"Like everything, when I was younger everything was bigger. Aside from that I'm good. I had two fillings and this helped with the pain.",4
3927,"So watered down, I didn't feel like it was actually shampoo. I tried twice then threw it away.",1
3928,I expected a larger scarf from what I saw on the image. It's nice but a bit too small for me.,2
3929,Bottle came open and most of the rosewater was spilled. Nice smell. Probably won't order again.,3
3930,Came in with some scuff marks so I ended up repainting it & now love it!,4
3931,Very soft and very big! The cream color is a little darker than I had hoped.,4
3932,I personally did not see a difference whatsoever in my cellulite. Therefore I am disappointed with this product especially considering the price.,1
3933,Works great. Smooth shave. Way better than shave cream from department stores.,4
3934,"Great product, however it cost way too much!  Therefore I did not give it a top rating.",4
3935,Excellent because the cost per ounce is less than the bigger bottles.  Down side is that you have 144 mini bottles of face wash.,5
3936,My daughter love it . She told me she wants to use it three times a day.,5
3937,The dentist said to buy it. People plagued by plaque will find this an easy way to remove it and save their teeth.,4
3938,awful the backs were to small to fit over the posts and they bend real easy,1
3939,Very nice. Just wish the brushes had lables on them for their uses for the beginner.,4
3940,an excellent product that i would buy again if offered for sale norelco razors are better than others great purchase,5
3941,The Very Best Razor Cream and the only one my Dad will use! Soooo glad I can find it on Amazon! Thanks! :-),5
3942,"That should remove smell , but in real it has a bad smell it self ",2
3943,"I've done two sets already, flawlessly, so I really recommend this kit! Wish the bottles were bigger.",5
3944,I bought this for my son. He says it worked fine.,3
3945,i think this product was diluted! the container was taped shut and the product was not the same as I've used before!,1
3946,I have a drawer full of blush as I'm continuously searching for that natural look. I found it in the Tropic Tan Bronzer!,4
3947,Looks and feels good but it stretches out rather quickly.,4
3948,"In less than a month, it was covered with black mildew. I don't understand how that even happens?!?!!",1
3949,"burned my wife's face, will never buy this again.. would not recommend to any one",1
3950,Works great. Just do not use too much. Start off with a little and add as u need.,5
3951,Very cute necklace!  Arrived quickly and did stay lit up for longer than I expected it would!,4
3952,This bracelet is very cute and as described. the selling point is the price. I like it and my granddaughters love it.,3
3953,A very good product even if I think that the pins are too small,4
3954,It does help dry your polish but more surface dry.,4
3955,These are so great and i am so glad i could order these online since none of the stores in the area sold them.,5
3956,Very pretty but the clasp is very difficult to do alone. Need someone else to close it.,4
3957,"Maybe it's just my skin, but this have to be the worst blades I ever shaved with.",2
3958,It smells horrible. Doesnt help with brushing my sons hair at all. Just waste of money.,1
3959,"Obviously not the best quality but does what it's suppose to do, a one-time use cover up.",4
3960,"Good product for the money, came in a timely manner.",1
3961,This seems great to begin with but not really made to last.  Needs to be a better fabric.  A nicer fabric would be better.,3
3962,"It works, but the odor it has is very strong, make sure to use in a well ventilated room.",3
3963,pretty decent product. Better than anything that I have found over the counter !!,4
3964,received it even sooner than expected date! the brushes are really soft and adorable and worth the price. I love them!,4
3965,The clasp for the case broken or cracked in 1/2 on the front of the case.,1
3966,These stones aren't as shiny as I expected.  I gave them to my 11 yr.old daughter.  She loved them.,3
3967,I think I need to take this product for a longer period of time to see if I get results as advertised and it's a little expensive.,3
3968,This item fell apart immediately upon opening the package. Extremely disappointed in the quality and my purchase.,1
3969,Can't bring it in close around the neck. Too loose.,1
3970,"have to return it after 2 months, it won't turn on!",2
3971,"I wasn't expecting much, but even my small expectations wernt met. Looks like a two dollar trinket from china",2
3972,"Item did feel like as natural as it look was very uncomfortable.
I bought this item thinkinin it would help but what I was so wrong.",1
3973,I loved them.  Although a bit smaller than I expected. they'll work perfect for my cards!  And there are sooooo many!!,4
3974,Worked great but a little expensive compared to a local store.,3
3975,Perfect product it works like new. Very cheap compared to a beauty salon.,5
3976,Shipped directly from China and smells like chemicals.  Very concerned to use it.  I tried to clean it but they still smell.,1
3977,Works just as advertised.  Long lasting battery.  I use this for beard and goatee trim as well as head shaving.  lightweight and attachments work fine.,4
3978,"The product is great, but when it arrived the bottles were leaking.",3
3979,Doesn't work as good as I had hoped but for simple light weight things it's good,3
3980,I did not like it. It doesn't get hot enough to straighten out my hair. Sorry,1
3981,Good price worked very well..... You should get a hand drill as it will take a while to finish if you don't...,5
3982,This stuff really gives a great shave.  I put it on with my old shaving brush so I don't waste any.,5
3983,its good except my brush won't fit the handle part = (,2
3984,these broke as  soon as my daughter tried to put them on,1
3985,Is beautiful. But when I opened the tale was broken,2
3986,"This product is very nice.  It applies easily and has a pleasant scent.  Hopefully, I will see long-term results.  Thank you.",4
3987,"Thick, sudsy, smells great, worth the price and lasts long.  Would buy again.",5
3988,"Good for no make-up, no sunscreen users.  I use sunscreen everyday, and its cleaning power is not strong enough to remove it.",2
3989,"I love this. I have oily skin and this works great, better than anything else I've tried.",4
3990,I love the scent of the music. Unfortunately they don't make this anymore but it's the best,5
3991,I like it and it smells good but the scent doesn't last long at all.,4
3992,"Not happy, not satisfied. Not sure I would tell a friend the picture looks me appealing. Wasn't it supposed pto come with a case?",1
3993,"I love this powder in and out of the bedroom, it's a nice daily scent and it glides on the skin.",4
3994,I have used this daily and haven't seen any improvement.,1
3995,"Works great! However, we blew through the small package in only a few days...We needed way more for a week-long vacation in the sun!",4
3996,Five stars if they turn the bottle into a jar.,4
3997,Love this! It has a smell to it but I like it and it leaves me feeling extra clean down there! ,4
3998,"Mine had not been sealed.
When I received mine, at least half my gems were in the bottom of the bag.",1
3999,"Used maybe 4 times and it stopped working. I have always used this brand curling irons, etc. Had no problems.",1
4000,"They are scissors, and they are sharp.  What's not to love?",5
4001,While this is not a high powered machine it does the job I needed it for and it is easy to use.,4
4002,It is a bit oily but is perfect for use in winter months when skill get dry.,4
4003,Wax was melted and all over the lid  also I thought this product would come with GiGi Wax Off!,4
4004,Thought I would try these rather than using toilet paper on the ends of my hair when rolling it.  Papers are pretty thin and ripped every time.,2
4005,Not good its nothing like it say. I had to throw my wig.,1
4006,"Cheap quality. Color does not stay on, turns silver, every. Time.",1
4007,The product did not come with thorough instructions and also seemed way to small to actually hold all of my hair in place.,1
4008,very disappointed with this product. the trimmings go everywhere and all over the trimmer itself..it's not very close at all..definitely leaves something to be desired..,1
4009,The item is missing in the box. It happening to me for first time. I searched everywhere and nothing. Totally disapointment!,1
4010,"Great value, color stays on and does the job! Defiantly would purchase",4
4011,A big disappointment .  My skin got more dry and scaly instead,1
4012,Finished the whole bottle nd nothing not even a slight difference. .I used it for over 2 weeks day and night ..,1
4013,Not what I expected and it did NOT include a scoop.,3
4014,I like the variety of tips/brushes and have even put mouthwash in the water receptacle per the instructions. It gave my mouth a very fresh feeling.,4
4015,"This is good product for dry, cracked skin, chapped lips, cracked cuticles and dry hand and feet",4
4016,"Wash my face twice a day. Wanted a washcloth that would be easy to launder, yet inexpansive and plentiful. Does the job.",4
4017,Didn't stay on my face. It fell off 2 seconds after I put it on and I lost it.,1
4018,Works wonderful but I would ask for better packaging bc some came lose and made a mess some even broke and the product doest stay on long,3
4019,Don't waste your money. This bracelet was cheaply made and broke the first week I received it.,1
4020,Really nice razor blades from a really nice seller. Im sticking with these from now on.,5
4021,I had an older model and could not find replacement heads.  This runs much quieter than my old one and does a great job,5
4022,I didn't see a difference but I still use as a moisturizer,3
4023,I received these and they do t say that they are for eye makeup. They are a little dry but generally work fine for cleaning.,4
4024,Nice but the border are not silver as the picture shows,3
4025,"Love the feel of this gown, I don't like the clasps though.. you can probably replace with velcro or something.",4
4026,Gets dull after 4th shave. Good raiser blade at the beginning.,4
4027,This soap lathers up like nobody's business.....long lasting....,5
4028,It does not cover tattoes as mentioned  in the advertising.,1
4029,powder really was like scented cornstarch. nice smell but more economical just to buy cornstarch,3
4030,This a piece of junk.  Wrinkles and looks awful on. Really a waste of money.,1
4031,Thank you so much good one nice to work with helpful cooperative good material I like it I appreciate it,4
4032,I have been using this product for years.  Keep me dry and does not come off on clothes.  What else needs to be said!,5
4033,I used window cleaner and rinse with water and it works just as good.,3
4034,I use it on my synthetic wig and it works great!,5
4035,"Nice quality, sturdiness and look.  Holds my brush and razor well.",5
4036,"it broke after 2 weeks of use, otherwise it could have been a great product.",2
4037,These are Original Equipment Manufactures replacement cutting heads for my Philips Norelco electric razor. They fit perfect and worked perfect!,5
4038,Great and practical - so glad I found this - no mess or fussing with cream and lotions.,5
4039,My skin looks clearer after using this for just a few days.  I will buy more.,5
4040,This gel is awful in my option. As soon as I'm done doing my nails it peels right off. Waste of money,1
4041,Creates residue when on the lips. Tint doesn't last. Wish I had returned it. Missed the return deadline.,2
4042,"They were adequate.  No special features or sense of ""love.""  Soon traded it out for a motorized one per dentist's recommendation.",3
4043,The product did what it was supposed to do. It makes it much easier for my wife to button her blouses.,5
4044,If the product had a nicer smell I would have rated it higher but I find the smell to be very unpleasant.,3
4045,Tried to use for silicone pasties. Didn't stay at all and it smelled AWFUL,1
4046,You can tell it is after market. I think if I were to buy again I would buy a orignal GI oiler.,3
4047,"Didn't work for me, and broke me out so bad I bled.",1
4048,I have had this item for about three weeks and really like the way it shave.  It is one of the best electric razor I have had.,4
4049,It has been great new to the sounding world and it has been a great new experience amazed at how good they fill would buy them again,4
4050,"My nails are in horrible shape, I had to stop using this stuff. They were breaking and chipping......bad bad bad!!!",1
4051,It fell apart as soon as I took it out of the box. I could not use it.  I returned it.,1
4052,It's smells nice but not really masculine and I haven't experienced the effect on the ladies as promised or advertised.,3
4053,These things are huge !!!!!! Lies you can not wear this too work it doesn't hide anything,1
4054,OK...poor quality...much better brands out there for the price...,3
4055,Very heavy made good strong heavy not bulky heavy. Was way better than what I thought they were gonna be,5
4056,"I expected purple, but got brown instead. Material is not what I expected either.",1
4057,DO NOT ORDER!!! They are extremely tiny pretty much useless!,1
4058,Dont waste your money :its all packaging no product ..Strips d,1
4059,Good product by one of the best brand in their field. Very comfortable to the skin. wish bar could have been better ajusted,4
4060,"I really like this product, makes your skin look so smoothe",5
4061,Worked very well. Love all of the attachments. I also like the variable pressure spray dial. I will use this alot.,4
4062,I enjoy the razor that is why I purchased the replacement heads whoever the price is hard to swallow. I will not do it again.,4
4063,You get what you pay for. Extremely cheap. The clip came right off the belt as soon as I tried on.,1
4064,"Good earrings for the price, I haven't had any problems with them yet",4
4065,"Excellent coverage; a bit pricey for the quantity, but worth it!",5
4066,This product leaves a nice silky finish with plenty of shine. A little goes a long way.,4
4067,"Smells great, sort of messy if you have no where to put it in the shower but overall I would order this product again.",5
4068,Great environmentally safe hair conditioner. I've used it before and am pleased with the way my hair feels afterwards.,5
4069,These give me a great shave and maybe I won't be so stingy about replacing my blades since I have so many.,5
4070,"5 were exactly the same and sever others were just alike they were not at all different, the balls actually stripped out quickly too,",2
4071,"Although this product smells lovely, that's all it did for me. Besides breaking my skin out it wasn't very fragrant on my skin.",1
4072,"Smells good, thought it would be more for the price",4
4073,100% exactly what I wanted!! Thank you so much!,5
4074,"This is cuter then I thought it was going to be for the money! Great costume prop!
I am happy!",5
4075,"This product would be comfortable, but unfortunately it's too big for my head and therefore, won't stay on overnight.",2
4076,"This product feels great going on, but the feeling is short-lived.  It only seems to moisturize for a couple of hours.",4
4077,The bottle is too small. Please make sure you look at the size they are overcharging for mini/tiny bottles,1
4078,Went on the wall very easy and looked great. I liked the way the letters were placed and the size was perfect.,4
4079,"Exactly as described. Could maybe be a little sharper, but a huge improvement over the 15 year old original blade. Most definitely worth the money.",4
4080,Smells Great  It doesn't seem to last to long though.,4
4081,The lock was broken and i really needed it so I couldn't send it back disappointed ,1
4082,So far I have been very happy with my brushes. The cost was in my price range an I love the  color.,3
4083,"well, you can see it has a very reasonable price. After I got it , I just used it twice and feel not bad or good",4
4084,This is somewhat larger than I expected. Also the ribbing along the top and bottom is slightly sharp and irritates my lady bits. Yikes.,2
4085,This was not that prickly.  I got a 5 pinwheel that is much better.,2
4086,Most awesome knife for a woman and her daughter who have both had strokes and both have only one arm each!!!!!!,5
4087,I love the smell. I enjoyed the bath more after using it.,4
4088,Stand performs perfectly. I use it to hold two different razors. A Shick Hydro and a Bic disposable.,4
4089,These arrived with only one goggle covered. Completely cheap and useless!,1
4090,"The tubing is very flexible making it easy to roll up,as I use it daily on a portable suction device.  Great product.",5
4091,This color is very similar. It is pretty easy to apply but not the smoothest appilication. I will be buying another one soon!,5
4092,Medium sharpness but not great for a thick beard. Good to learn with or use when you don't have time,4
4093,This part did not fit the shaver.  It is supposed to fit a Series 1.  It doesn't,1
4094,"Very funky odor. Much different than original product, unfortunately.",2
4095,"This shaver was so noisy it woke everyone in the house before I left for work one morning, needless to say I returned it.",1
4096,glitter in a cheap box not as shown way to small to long to devlery not even 3000 gems maybe 1000,1
4097,Overpriced. Should be able to buy a dozen or two for a decent price.,3
4098,Looks good just wish it was a little deeper but still good,4
4099,When I weighed this product it was only 8.5lbs VERY unacceptable ! other than that it is a good product and is authentic,3
4100,Was clearly used when I received. And half the bottle was hardened as the lid was opened.,1
4101,"I didn't really see a big change in my hair, I no longer use this oil, grape-seed oil is just as good for my hair.",3
4102,"In general I am not too picky about flavors, but this floss tastes like bleach; stay away from this one.",1
4103,"three of these were purchased, two for gifts.  We were not that impressed with how the flow of water or mouth wash comes out.",3
4104,"This is an average moisturizer.  I apply at night, but the moisture is completely gone by morning. I will not purchase again.",2
4105,Would of given it 5 if it had more pressure.,4
4106,It is OK I would like it a little hotter but works fine . It is definitely hotter than my old one and grips the hair nicely,4
4107,These didn't really work for me. They didn't hold me up at all like I thought they would. I returned them.,2
4108,Bought the product a month ago no change doesn't work.,3
4109,"Back to shaving like a man. Brush holder could have extended just a little further, but otherwise satisfied.",4
4110,Great product when used with Coconut oil and Caster oil.,5
4111,I really wanted to like this product but it stings my eyes.  I threw it out.,2
4112,Worked pretty well but need to go over areas several times to get good shave.,4
4113,Don't stay too much time so is not like they talk. But the colors are very loyal and works very well during the time that lasts,3
4114,"No longer works and it's too late to return it. Very unhappy, I got the same one from target and it lasted much longer.",1
4115,Terrible! Looks totally fake and way too big on the nose. Waste of money.,1
4116,This was a gift and the recipient liked it very much.  The quality was very good and nice looking too.,4
4117,Didn't' received extra chips otherwise item was good. The extra cards allows more people to join in. More people more fun.,4
4118,Only lasted alittle over a month and fan kept surging on unit. Very disappointed and can not return. But loved it while it worked.,1
4119,FLIMSY NON FITTING AND WHEN YOU SEND IT BACK THE POSTAGE WILL COST MORE THAN PRODUCT ITSELF. Just don't buy it,1
4120,The products work well but the fragrance is too overwhelming. I like the smell of gardenias but this is way too much.,3
4121,I received a empty envelope that had nothing in it so I didn't open it there was no merchandise in what should I do,1
4122,"Nice refined product. Does an excellent job, easy to clean and gives many shaves on one recharge.",4
4123,Color not a pictured. Is nude and I cannot wear it; photo appeared light mauve.,1
4124,serves it's purpose as I use it in my massage therapy business.  Great value for the money.  I could use a spare,5
4125,The clip broke off the top of the head. We are going to try to superglue it. Very very cute though.,2
4126,"Cheap construction, cards don't fit and seller won't accept returns.  Seller shouldn't be prime.",1
4127,sex in the city kiss by instyle parfum eau de  spray has not good smell and state just for 1 minut i don not recomend,1
4128,I like this ...it could be a little pinker for my preference but I just add a little more ...its worth the money,4
4129,I like using this better than flossing and my teeth and mouth feel much cleaner than with flossing.  Great product.,4
4130,I have used this razor for quite a while and find it to be fine. Replacement heads are available everywhere.,4
4131,"These things are awesome, don't know why they are hard to find! They are the best thing out there! They work great!",5
4132,"It didn't work that well. It sure is embarrassing when it doesn't stay put, and someone finds it on the bathroom floor.",2
4133,"I was happy to try this, but after using them for a couple of days , my face broke out all over :(",1
4134,"As soon as I open it , one of the brushes fell apart then a week later the others",2
4135,"this product suppose to be waterproof and its NOT, it gets all over your clothers. and its to greasy",1
4136,I have small hands and it was even too small for my hands. The quality is ok.,3
4137,Brought it to raise stubble for shaving. Doesn't do that for me but does protect sensitive skin during shaving.,3
4138,"Like but wish there were more beads, feels very little",3
4139,These gems are great except for the fact that the gems fall off your nails really easily. They did arrive early though.,3
4140,"Goopy, glitter clumps.  It's a great price!",1
4141,Love this stand. Nice chrome finish. Heavy base stable. Fits straight edge razor and brush wonderfully!,5
4142,Good quality product that work effectively in getting rid of excess hair for my daushuand,5
4143,I really like this stuff but it is way too expensive compared to other products i have seen,4
4144,Worked great the first time or two then lost its potency! I guess you get what you pay for.,2
4145,Don't see a great difference. Smells really nice though.,3
4146,Works but irritates my highly sensitive skin. I can't do it on a daily basis,4
4147,"It does it's job, son is 9yo. :)",4
4148,"not quite what i was hoping for,but ok.",3
4149,"This does not work well at all. A normal razor gets the job done with less discomfort, it's not worth the money.",2
4150,"This razorock alum stick is awesome, I really love this and suggest another ones!!!!",4
4151,Poor material. Not a good quality I guess you got what you pay for !,1
4152,Supposed to make the hair shiny.  I didn't see that but it was more like a hair spray,3
4153,"I love this scent unconditional Love, soft and clean. Amazons value was great also for this set. Thanks again for another great product!",5
4154,Nice comb gets the job done. Thinking of getting another one,5

4166,"THIS IS NOT TAPE!  THIS IS DENTAL ""FLOSS""!",1
4167,"Love this barrette, beautiful. Just really small. I thought it'd be regular size like the similar ones I had bought before it.",3
4168,Small can. Put quality product. Stiff it is.,4

4172,Color did not match color in picture. It's more of a hot pink. Very unattractive and very unsatisfactory,1

4176,"Brushes are soft, I like that they are small enough to carry around easily",3
4177,"Very absorbent, great fit.  Only four stars because it was hard to button it closed.",4
4178,It made me sweaty more. Only gave it one star because it was delivered on time.,1
4179,I left it on overnight. Was really happy with result. Lines reduced dramatically.,4
4180,They are very nice. I just wish they were just a little bit shorter.  very easy to put on and take off. good quality.,4

4227,"These nails are pretty thin and flimsy, they might be okay if you're using them as a base for acrylic.",3
4228,Misleading product title.  Only received one instead of a pack of four.,1
4229,Not enough hair in the print where the bangs part. You can't tottally see the cap underneath,2
4230,Some of the colors come out darker  even though they look light beware before when applying them,3

4240,"keeps my gums and teeth clean, a little noisy, but it works fine.  apparently I need to type more words to submit",4
4241,They aren't kidding when they say unscented. It doesn't appear to even have a natural ingredient smell.,4
4242,"meant for use with high price cleaning device but also works as a simple ""soak and rinse"" cleaner. maybe once a week is adequate",2
4243,Good. I didn't expect much since I'm going through the change. So I sweat like a hog.,4
4244,Christmas present for my son along with the big boy razor.  He was very happy,5

4254,It was to harsh for my face. I had to send them back. It wasn't smooth to use and was to small.,1
4255,"Wish I could return, very underpowered for my thick, wavy hair.  Has virtually no effect. Might work well on thinner hair.",2

4258,"its not worth one star, as it did not work.",1
4259,The Pendulum was What I expected and was received in good condition. It worked well with the cuckoo clock I had,3
4260,"I love the water pik idea, but it is a bit loud. I definitly makes me ""floss"" more often than I normally do.",3
4261,I feel like it does a nice job of evening out my skin tone.,4
4262,I wish the nails were longer.... but It'll work. The hand is a nice size and the quality appears to be good.,4
4263,"This product will help retaining hair you already have.
I can say it's retaining the hair.",4
4264,"I love giving myself a little finger massage, but honestly I can't tell a difference.",3

4266,"Are u people kidding !!
it's just a red sticker !!, no glitter no nothing  .",1
4267,"Some blades sharper than others in package. Great price, so no complaints.",4
4268,This is yet another facial toner that irritated my skin.,1

4278,Nice earrings but kind of too thick for little girls ear.,4
4279,Takes it a bit to heat up but it's perfect for curling the end of my hair.,4
4280,I bought this item to replace my broken flosser.  It works just fine...better than the other company's product. Would purchase again.,4
4281,Not a huge fan of the wax itself... Will purchase a different wax. The machine works wonderfully though.,4
4282,Great. Not much structure but looks great and somewhat functional.,4
4283,Tubing too short and too rigid could cause waterpik tubing to break or the waterpik to fall and break. Otherwise OK,2
4284,I love this stuff. Smells so good and that's hard to find for somethhg without tons of chemicals. Am already on my second purchase.,5
4285,Soft matte finish with gloss shine. Lasting allllll day. Love it,4
4286,Maybe it doesn't work Asian hair.  Tried this for 15 days.  Nothing.  I am skeptical about the positive reviews here.,1

4301,The package came and the cream box was damaged and ripped and cream was half gone and all over! Also was not sealed!,1
4302,Good bowl for a puck of Mitchel's Wool Fat. After use the puck expands or fills into the the entire bowl.,4
4303,"Good coverage, but the ""Light/Medium Brown is Black.",4
4304,I followed the instructions and the dye washed off too quickly :( One or two washes and that was it. I moved to another brand,3
4305,I love it! It's much better if you take off the guard and just use it like that! Really trims good that way!,4
4306,Not what I expected I throw it away the product was no good the clue wasn't holding at all it's false advertising,1
4307,The color is dull. Not what I expected. Doesnt last long on your lips,2

4314,"the chain is acceptable, but the medal is very very poor quality, has many bubbles",1
4315,It smells good but othere than that . Nothing else.,1
4316,Not timpressed with this at all.  Power is very weak and it smells like it has been in a warehouse storage forever.,1
4317,"Thid is not exactly what I want, but I can't find what I want do it will do in the meantime.",3
4318,I received this expired..... no wonder my face got red when I wased it off,1

4320,THIS IS NOT MUSK IT HAS NO SCENT AT ALL AS A MATTER OF FACT IT STINKS PLEASE REPLACE WITH REAL MUSK,1

4323,My wife loves it but it's really just expensive petroleum jelly.,4

4326,Has no scent. I don't think it's a legitimate product. ,1
4327,"This dental tape does not snag or fray like all the others I've used, and leaves my teeth feeling very clean.",4
4328,It is a gimmick. Water picks do a much better job of flossing. Even a flossing thread does a better job.,1
4329,I like the brush but hate the boring silver colour I got. It's frustrating that you can't pick the colour you want.,3
4330,It helps protect my skin from the heavy sun rays lights.,4
4331,Just ok.  Not bad but not fantastic.  If one can get a trial sample somewhere would definitely do the trial before investing in the whole amount,2
4332,Does not work like the old formula! Will try another brand,1
4333,I have gallbladder problems and this enzyme has been of great help to eat food that doesn't usually agree with me.  I highly recommend itl.,5

4339,Very healing if youve tried all other lotions on the market.,5
4340,the pressure is noticeably weaker than the conventional water pic machine.the pressure is noticeably weaker than the conventional water pic machine.,3
4341,"Works very slow, doesn't cut well, hair gets stuck between the razor and attchment clip so you have tobrush it off constantly. Bad product",1
4342,Great I use as an e liquid additive. Love not smoking.......,4

4347,"Excellent ,hard to find in retail stores, at a reasonable price.",4
4348,"GREAT, BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE A STAND TO HOLD THE FLOSSERS",3
4349,This stuff works well. The cape covers a lot and the jacket is good enough.,4
4350,Works great & easy clean-up - but stinky! Smells like nasty chemicals!,4
4351,Good product as advertised.  A smaller stick would suffice.  .,3
4352,"Solid construction, good fit and finish.  The razor side just fits my razor.",4
4353,Smells great.  Worked well as a body soap as well as general cleaner.,4
4354,"A friend recommended it.  I was skeptical but if you suffer from vertigo, this is an awesome alternative to get you through the work day.",5
4355,"love this product,have tried many but Dermalogica is only one that meets my expectations",5
4356,"In my top 3 of DE razors, behind Astra and Feather",4
4357,"Really thick, and hard to wash out! I could hardly sculpt it.",2
4358,I bought this for my husband it excellent quality and fits his shaving soap well. The wood is high quality and it is easy to clean.,5
4359,Terrible product. My hair got tangled every time I used it. Complete misrepresentation!,1
4360,"Right out of the box, this product never worked!",1
4361,If zero stars was n option dats wat i wudve rate it...Nothing bt a cheap copycat version...would not recommend. ..,1
4362,Not a bad product but kind of pricey for the amount you get. I will just make my own with essential oils and witchhazel.,4
4363,"Goes great with my new Viking razor. Looks good, everything fits real nice, easy to clean.",5
4364,"The product works great! But like others said, the bottle came with only half full. Where is the other half????",4

4366,Caps are too loose. You loose he pens too easily.,3
4367,High quality sharp razors that provide a very smooth shaving. It does not pull like some cheaper brands. Highly recommend.,5
4368,"Convenient in use. Cleans teeth well, though does not replace routine cleaning by dentist. An important part of oral care.",5
4369,I see no benefit to using this product. I have been using the oil spray by Alterna Bamboo with visible results but this cream disappoints.,1
4370,"Unit lost pressure after minimal use, very disappointed in quality . Have had other waterpik products and never had a problem .",1
4371,Large flocculent precipitate appeared at the bottom of the bottle after a few month of using. Wondering if it still can be used or not.,2

4373,Doesn't work as well as the description says it does.,2
4374,Loved them except the bands were too small even for a newborn ,4
4375,I found the pressure on the Waterpik to be much higher than the Braun I owned. It get's the job done!,4
4376,Does not remove hair as it claims.  Waste of money. Will not recommend this to anyone,1
4377,I've had it for less then a year and it's already stopped working. Highly disappointed with this Panasonic product.,1
4378,My first pomade but I'll admit I'm a big fan,4
4379,Everything was as promised.  Any problems were because it takes a while to get used to using it.  Practice makes perfect!,5
4380,Disappointed with the pump. Impossible to get the lotion out!,1
4381,I guess I'm one of the folks that such a devise will not work as stated.,2
4382,Do not buy. The items plating comes off and they are pitted.,1
4383,This product is a godsend. Many years of jockitch because of the.moisture. All gone after one use. I love this freaking product.,5
4384,It looks very sprayed on and fake to me. I'm not planning to use it...,1
4385,Thought this would help my husbands psoriasis in the dry winter months.  He gave it a so-so.,3

4388,"Cute, but really tight. Stretch them out before you wear them",3
4389,Works perfecctly. Had one before for many years that finally wore down.  Highly recomend to anyone who values their teeth and gums.,4

4392,I like the product is perfect gift for my sister... My sister loved the product and liked it a lot.. Happy Holidays :),5
4393,"its a great product, love the way it feels on my skin and keeps it moisturised! love the way it smells :)",5
4394,Packaging was not damaged this oil works best overnight but isn't greasy.,5
4395,"It didn't hold well and was still pretty noticeable, not clear enough",2
4396,This compact trimmer works very well. Holds charge for a long time so always ready to go. Cuts nicely without ripping. Nice unit.,4
4397,This product really works! It grows and thickens the hair quickly.. The oil is thick so less is more. I highly recommend this product.,4
4398,Cool name but not that good of a blade in my opinion,1
4399,"Good purchase, I haven't really had a breakout sense I started using it.",5
4400,"Nice smell, not thick or overpowering. Would purchase again to work in concert with the body wash of the same scent.",4
4401,This was such a disappointment.  The airflow was weak and the brush barely grabbed my hair.,1

4403,"I was expecting this bars to be a bit bigger, but I would have to say that all in all I was happy with the purchase.",4
4404,This is just a regular fragrance...nothing special about it except its price...five stars reviews saying that it has some attracting effects are suspicious...,1
4405,I its perfect for my 10 in tablet....It was a good buy I like it..keeps the glass safe from damage,4
4406,Good product at fair price. Just a little bulky to store. This is our second and they do help with issues.,4
4407,Its just as described. Might want to purchase more of the waxing sticks and fiber strips because they don't have many if you using your waxer daily,4
4408,"Perfect for inbetween coloring - spray around the temples keeps the obvious ""color line""  under control.",5
4409,"Hydrating with a hint of color.  Does not cover flaws well, but does even out skin overall. This is my second time purchasing this product.",4
4410,Nice looking candle but the scent is not strong at all. I don't smell it . Looks good though. That's is all ,3
4411,Took a couple uses to masteEasier to use than the brush in one hand and blow dryer in the other.,4
4412,They test on animals meaning this product is officially ruined for me,1
4413,Some bow ties fell apart without being worn. Other than that my son loves them.,4
4414,I was very hopeful for this product to work for me. Did not notice any difference.,1
4415,Can't stand the scent. It is not the frankincense and myhhr I have known. Smells more like patchouli oil.,1
4416,This does soften wax in the ears and works quite nicely to remove makeup without drying the skin.,4
4417,bad bad bad quality and s***ty smell it is terrible smelling and i wouldnt reccommend at all very very bad,1
4418,Has a faulty latch on the hair compartment door. A year or so ago they replaced it at no charge but it just broke again.,2
4419,"I have to use some kind of lipstick sealer, my lips just doesn't hold color. Works well.",5
4420,Does not come off easy and you have to make sure u don't mess up or it's a mess,3
4421,"great stuff, cheaper than what I was using and works great!",5
4422,First water flosser I bought. Works as expected although it is a bit noisy. Hope the attachments will last for a while.,4
4423,Good dispenser for alcohol when you need to be able to access with only one hand.  No lid to take off and on or drop.,5
4424,They seem to be lasting pretty well.  Good sunnies for the price,4
4425,I think this color may be good for pretty much any complexion.,4
4426,Great gift.  My order arrived sooner than I expected.  This is a good deal.  This was a Christmas present to myself.,4
4427,easy to catch hair in the groomer and easy to irritate the skin...,3
4428,the color is very pale orange and I'm afraid I won't be wearing it,2
4429,Exactly what I ordered took a little while but still ok,4
4430,It arrived on time!. works great and hope it will continue working the same way. we loved it and had very much faun with it.,4
4431,"It works just as any other deodorant works. Honestly, I didn't think it was worth my money tho :/",4
4432,I don't see the point to this item its cheaper then wash buckler in figures waste of money and it also came in a bag,1
4433,"looks OK, useful to eliminate crack on finger tips.",4
4434,Product wreaks of bug killer smell. Try the dollar store.,1
4435,ok. at first was fine. now it doesn't seem that smooth.,4
4436,Works great waiting for an hair appointment that is a week away,5
4437,This is the best Dental Floss you can find.. particularly if you have larger space between your teeth ... others don't compare.,5

4444,this is awesome ..  very pretty.. and will give as gifts to all the granddaughters and nieces,5
4445,Stated that product was new and unopened. Seal was broken when I received it and it was used.,1
4446,Doesn't feel like a toner. Feels like oily water on my face.,1
4447,"It is average for similar tools.  It does the job but, like most similar instruments, it's awkward and hard to use accurately, .",3
4448,Does not remain stuck to the tile for long. Not good suction cup material. Pass on it. Not worth it.,1
4449,The fragrance proved annoying and it failed to leave hair feeling clean. Won't purchase again.,2
4450,My son uses these all the time so when I see a sale I always pick them up. It great for cuts too,4
4451,This was a waste of money.  It did not do what is it supposed to do and it smalled like Garlic.  Who would want that?,1
4452,"This product was a replacement part for my shaver.  It fits like the original one,which broke.  It is just what I needed.",5
4453,I'm amazed with how good these brushes are for a couple bucks!,5
4454,I really like the stove.......only thing I do not like Is that it stays extremely hot giving off a lot of heat.,4

4457,"Very brown.  Looked peachy in the picture, it's not.",2
4458,"The actual product does not have the black lettering that the image has. Feels rather cheap, but will work for cosplay.",3
4459,Really like the nice mild fragrance.  Cannot find this Old Spice Body Wash Foxcrest on the local retail shelves for some unknown reason???,5
4460,These are terrible. I'm so disappointed. The suction was so weak when I used these. They are worthless.,1
4461,"Best Shampoo I have ever used, You would be foolish not to try it.",5
4462,It arrived broken. Very cheaply made. Flowers are pretty though. Sorry the pic is a bit blurry.,1
4463,SEEING A LITTL BIT FULLER LASHES.  WAITING FOR IT  TO KICK IN.  I  HAVE USED IT FOR 3WEEKS NOW,4
4464,lost zero inches. look exactly the same. i had so much hope :( oh well eat right and exercise will do the trick,1
4465,"THE CHAIN WILL NOT FIT YOUR HEAD.  If you plan on wearing this, don't buy it.",1
4466,"bought this razor and was completely disappointed, doesn't do the job, find another razor this one is a lemon.",1
4467,"These are the standard refills for this rasor, no big surprise either way.
Order fulfilled in reliable, fast manner. It works just fine.",4
4468,This gel is awful in my option. As soon as I'm done doing my nails it peels right off. Waste of money,1
4469,"Bigger than I thought, which makes it a little bit harder to use, but it works great!",4
4470,I really like this bubble bath! The smell is great! I feel so relaxed after using it.,4
4471,"Good hair dryer, but I don't think it really qualifies as ""Low Noise."" About average on the noise front.",4
4472,"the foundation is fine but i was supposed to get 2 packs, got one only. ",2
4473,Shipped two of same. I ordered one each to include the Quinine Tonic,3
4474,"Lacks power, but the dual voltage feature is definitely nice when travelling although not yet used.",3

4477,"Wonderful product. After blow drying, use this to finish & it gives your hair a nice shine.",4

4479,Love the Argan Oil!  Have noticed more softness and glow.,4
4480,In the picture it looks small and elegant but when it came it looked more like a children's knecklace bulky,1
4481,These will make a cute little gift. You can't beat he price which is why I even bought them. Came quick too.,5
4482,I uses because I have a little scar to hide and it works perfectly,5

4487,"The powder works great and leaves no residue, I only gave it a 4 rating because I haven't tried the lotion yet.",4
4488,Haven't noticed any difference after  month now.  Glad I didn't pay full price!,3
4489,The product itself is great. The container purchased from the recent seller was defective.,1
4490,Had to super glue some of the brush tips back onto the wooden stick and the bristles fall out easily. You get what you pay for.,3
4491,"This product is too coarse for the soap to get through. I simply do not like it. It is, however, a great exfoliator.",2
4492,Best addition to my Santa makeup ever.  Really helps my face sweat less and provides a nice prep for my makeup,5
4493,"Its garbage!!
Cheap material and its noisy when rotating!
Its not worthy your money, DO NOT BUY.",1
4494,"Love this still using it.
Less dental work when I go see my dentist :)",4
4495,"This stuff is not so great. Its just very oily. There's much better pomade around, though it will cost more.",1
4496,These save your eyes in a tanning booth! Most salons will not let you use tanning booths without them. Highly recommended.,4
4497,the first few times of use it irritated my skin after about a week my skin got used to it and it is very easy to clean as well,4
4498,Leaves my hair in a waxy texture.. others shampoo bars leave it smooth and silky. Guess it depend on the hair texture,2
4499,Love the product.  However it was over priced by this seller.,3
4500,"Nice, everyone is very friendly when I wear it.",4
4501,"Easy to use, beautiful result with the exact color I want. Great instructions. I've used Tints of Nature for many months and recommend it.",5
4502,It does a great job when I trim my beard. I also sometimes use it to shave too.,4
4503,It is a nice soap bowl.  The laquer job is very good.  I would buy it again if I needed another one.,5
4504,"Small and doesn't pull or snag, this shaver can reach narrow places and get very close to the skin. A really great trimmer for ladies!",5
4505,"The candle in hand looks better than the photo plus the aroma is oo la la for those intimate moments, I dare say!",5
4506,"Easy for diaper bag, thickness makes it hard to squeeze with one hand",4
4507,Completely matte and color is amazing but it's so sticky when I close my mouth there is a lag of my lips opening expected much more,3
4508,Too small and wimpy compared to original style that came with my Braun.,2
4509,Fragile two broke in first day!!! Hope rest will not.. Too expensive for 5 @ $5 of this bad quality!!!,1
4510,I love this product.  I can keep my sensitive areas shaved and no bumps or razor burn.  I also use it as an after shave lotion.,5
4511,Not met the expectations because did not received how i want it.,1
4512,after the 3 week trial period I am very satisfied with the performance. close shave and holds the charge well extremely quiet,4
4513,"It is reasonably prices product  that I think works just as well as the more expensive pomades, like Crew and such.",4
4514,"I have only been using the product a week so it is too early to know if it works.  It is easy to apply,",4
4515,cheap and simple body chain. goes with anything & i won't cry about it when it breaks lol. I would purchase this again.,5
4516,Very oily and really doen't seem to be doing much to raise an eyebrow to the oppesit sex. Not impressed... Sorry,1
4517,"I did not get the mouth wash , it was not near the front door and I wake before 10 am",3
4518,"Good, just takes too long to get here. But I'm glad i got them.",4
4519,"Standard double edged razor blades. A GREAT value for the price. Work well with any razor, old or newly purchased.",5
4520,"The ""new and improved"" foil with Gillette technology is too fragile.  They rarely last two months before they develop a hole.",1
4521,"If you have the Hydrofloss, you must have this, too.  This device increases the velocity and pressure of the jet.",5
4522,Product did not work. No peeling and I followed all instructions.,1
4523,I have not  used this yet. With that said I love their products. I am taking this to the beach with me.,5
4524,"It's my own fault for buying it.  Seriously, you'll have more fun burning your money than buying this product.  .",1
4525,"I apologize for being rude, but to me this mouthwash tastes like a bad experiment on the first day someone went to bartending school.",1
4526,"I love these, but I ended up getting all pink. Its a good product, I just wanted silver.",4
4527,Excellent ointment. A bigger container will be easier to open and use.,4
4528,it stopped working like a minute after i plugged it in,1
4529,Very nice ointment! Can be applied anywhere. This product works well on my face and lips in fall/winter.,5
4530,When I order it the show in pic different colors. But I just got all 4 is same black color don't like it,1
4531,I just received the shipment and the package within the box was absolutely empty.,1
4532,"Amazing for the price. Good rich color just a little more red than I wanted, but I like it.",4
4533,"Was smaller than I expected, returned with ease. Thanks!",4
4534,Not worth it.  Give you razor burn and it doesn't give you a close enough shave.  I would not recommend it.,1
4535,"good product, but I almost didn't make the razor fit",3
4536,This is an awesome product.  I love using it on my hair and get awesome texture!  TameraD,5
4537,Dont like that I couldn't choose my color and the lenses do not seem dark enough for me.,1
4538,I was unable to purchase this item in any drug store and it's my favorite. Happy to find it.,5
4539,"I don't see that it softens, detangles or conditions my hair and haven't noticed any added sparkle, lol. Will not reorder.",1
4540,They are really sticky the color is on point but sticky after applying had to add lip bomb and then it worked but then rubbed off,3
4541,"Dont like that it didn't stayed on the nail and broke apart trying to put it in place, i think cause its to dry",1
4542,"Liked the product very much...Received as explained and used it. Have recommended this to couple of my friends too!

Thanks!",4
4543,Not happy after giving these out in stockings a few of them did not light up!,1
4544,Thanks! Quick delivery. Very high priced item though!,4
4545,I think this product is average. It takes many strokes to remove hair closely. I was expecting a better product than what was advertised.,3
4546,The drugstore combs start coming apart in a few months.  This one is still like new,5
4547,"Currently awaiting refund. The cord arrived with wiring exposed, and I didn't realize until after I started using it. Very dangerous flaw.",1
4548,My hair is softer with less frizz after blow drying.,5
4549,I am not loving this product. It is mediocre at best and the plastic accessory constantly falls off.,3
4550,"Actually made my babys skin more dry, red, and blotchy.",1
4551,Can use a few times before you need a new one,4
4552,I expected a darker brown -- but it goes on beautifully.,3
4553,"Yes, it is as described. I like it.",4
4554,"Really like this product...perfect size...
It could have just a little higher power settings...",5
4555,I bought this cream at the drug store. I have bad leg circulation and this stuff works well.  I give it 3 stars.,3
4556,I ordered two one came ion the shrink wrap with a hole in the top,1
4557,Have been using MD complete for about 3 weeks now and have not seen a difference in my skin,3
4558,not a good fitting vest and the zippers are very sharp and scratch your arms!,1
4559,Thus far I've been very pleased with the Norelco hair clippers. I particularly like that it is small and cordless.,4
4560,This is an amazing product. One application lasts about 6 weeks for me. It is so nice to be able to eat without pain.,5
4561,Horrible product! Skip this and use a good primer that hydrates instead! w,1
4562,"It was okay, but it did shed a lot for the first four days.",4
4563,Smells good and works okay. If you have really sensitive skin I would go with something else like First Aid Beauty Smooth Shave Cream.,3
4564,Would you love to do your own acrylic nails and have them peel off in just four days-tops?!-here's your chance!,1
4565,This was recommended by my dermatologist. It really does fade dark spots and dark circles.,5
4566,great cover-up foundation but too oily/greasy... I have oily skin so I would prefer a matte look,4
4567,Way to large they won't even stay in place on my ear because of the weight.,1
4568,Big lipped brown girls' best friend. Perfect saturated matte coverage.,5
4569,"Very flimsy, uncomfortable and hard to keep on. Does not fit on toes and won't stay in place.  I will be returning this item.",1
4570,"Smells good...a good deal, smells like Clubman..but has a softer lighter smell.  Fast shipping great price...nice handy plastic bottle and hole",4
4571,You do not need very much and feels nice on the skin.,4
4572,Love this product.  Works like a dream. Smooths my decollette after 1 wear.,5
4573,This product definitely whitens teeth. The only problem I have is that is makes me drool and the strips are no long enough.,4
4574,It wasn't very well made and extremely snug. It barely had any stretch at all,2
4575,I am a C cup and this did not hold my breast up at all. Barely sticks.,1
4576,I didn't receive the strap that goes behind my head to hold them on.,2
4577,Product has surpassed my expectations. I will continue using it. I would recommend to people that they try it. Bye,4
4578,"These sounds are feather light. They should have more weight, otherwise they are made well.",3
4579,"just started to use the product .  it appears that the brown spot is getting lighter.  need more time to see if it
goes away.",4
4580,"Extremely hard to apply evenly, and does not last. I was kind of disappointed because I absolutely love the color.",2
4581,These wraps do not work. Don't waste your money!,1
4582,"gave the shower gel for a Christmas gift, she said she loved it, thanks rvv.",5
4583,Even though it said for sensitive skin my skin felt irritated and almost burned after using once.  I returned this product,2
4584,"Great product, expected a different aroma from this oil.",3
4585,Skin did not improve. Felt like using scented water.,1
4586,"I have tried several other colors but this one flakes off more easily than the other colors do, I am not sure why.",3
4587,Works well but wish I could find one with a smaller barrel,4
4588,"Nice body oit, but the Dreamsicle scented Glow Oil works better, no idea why. Good service, thanks.",4
4589,"Good performance, good price.  Styling is a bit tired - maybe using their molds from the 50s keeps the price low ;o)",4
4590,Great inexpensive root cover.  It cost about 1/3 the price if Bumble and Bumble's spray and works almost as well.  It is definitely Medium Brown.,4
4591,Only came with 2 guards instead of the 3 that are advertised. Also the guards are hard to put on.,1
4592,"Stones had fallen out in the package,  I glued them back and for the price it's cute and wrth some super glue.",3
4593,"It was as my Dentist had said, gets between the teeth better than regular floss.",4
4594,unsatisfied. it don't hold my breast up and its hard to come off.,1
4595,1st time shaver with safety razor.  Tried razor  multi sample pack to determine the blade that worked best for me.  Astra was the one.,5
4596,Really does the job. One of the best. Quality of the product is excellent.,4
4597,"A color for every day, outfit, good price.",4
4598,"Soso, won't buy agian. Does not leave hair soft.",3
4599,Great to go organic but these socks shrink and become hard to pull on.,3
4600,"They arrived sooner than expected, which is nice. The jewels are glued in tightly. Would probably order again.",4
4601,"Works as intended. Only pulled my hair ONCE, and that was when it needed a battery change, anyway.",5
4602,Works great for those moments when you want a quick spray for little jobs.,4
4603,Great deal.  100 blades lasted me almost two years.,4
4604,"I thought it was a bargain price, but it actually cost more than if I had bought it locally.",3
4605,"This was a pretty good product to use, and it leaves a soft feel to the skin.  Not sure if will order again.",4
4606,"Not over powering aroma, Subtle, There is just something about Aqua Velva,,, man",4
4607,"it came a lot earlier than expected, I just wish I could've chosen the color of headband.",5
4608,Had to replace my old on. Love it. Miss it when out of town,4
4609,Hard to old when it melts down. Rather stay with the square made one's.,3
4610,Great cap but it doesn't really stay on my head the whole night...,4
4611,Im unable to use these as there are no directions in English. Therefore it was a huge waste of my money.,1
4612,I like the product.  It works well and covers gray hair as described in the product information.  Hopefully the price will go lower.,4
4613,works but not as quickly as it was claimed. It does show clearing of blackheads.,3
4614,Loved the color. The lipstick applies perfectly and last a long time. Highly recommend  to try it!,4
4615,"Scents are ok overall, with the sweet almond being our favorite.",3
4616,"This product reduced my acne scars by so much! I don't really like the smell but, the product is great.",4
4617,"The floss breaks easily. Not even as strong as cheap generics. Handy to have, but practically useless as just snaps in half.",2
4618,"Was not impressed, the iron would snag and pull my hair, not a very pleasant experience!",3
4619,Its okay. should have paid the extra $20 and gotten the better one,4
4620,These replacement heads would probably have worked great if the machine didn't break first.  Craptastic product from Philips....,1
4621,"My product came promptly on time, looks very nice, and has a nice heft to.",4
4622,Holding up thus far but it it has had only four uses.,4
4623,This mens razor is light weight and easy to use. Gives a close shave and should give long service.,4
4624,"Smells good.  Works well!  A little greasy and does seem to ""stain"" your skin a bit until you wash it off.",4
4625,For some reason these flowers are all black and broken.,1
4626,Great blades! First time using a safety razor and have never had any nicks or experienced any sort of irritation with these blades.,5
4627,"Feels oddly cold and wet when applied, but works well.",4
4628,Worked really well. My only issue is that the bottle was not full when I received it.,4
4629,i can use one blade for around six shaves . Heavy beard,5
4630,It is a very nice brand I liked it but it could have been better the color was not what i expected.,4
4631,It didn't work at ALL! My titties still small ASF ' . Thanks for nothing Japan'',1
4632,the eyes are white doesn't look like that from the picture,2
4633,"Good product, and I got the best price from Amazon by at least $10.00. Product would be great if it was not so messy.",4
4634,Product not as pictured. Finish is bubbling all over both sides.,1
4635,Great value and it last a long time. I enjoy it very much. It keeps me clean. Love it lots.,5
4636,both broke in under a week. Dont buy handmade things. very disappointed. but the design was great. i wouldnt buy again,1
4637,This product works good for dry and cracking feet and lips. I would recommend.,5
4638,I like the bracelet. It looks exactly like the picture however it is a little smaller than what I expected.,4
4639,"Alright product. For the price these are good, but ELF tends to have better products.",3
4640,This did absolutely nothing for my dark circles and it was expensive. I do NOT recommend it.,1
4641,"Update: reordered and package came leaking and wet. A third of product lost! Great stuff, wish it had a little more silver to it.",4
4642,Only stay on the eyepieces for about 2 days.  Hardly worth the trouble and expense.,2
4643,"Horrible. Style of wig wasn't as shown, VERY thin and shed badly. I didn't even use it. Looked too bad.",1
4644,The skull is cute. The necklace is not 24 inches as promised though.....I received a 16 inch necklace.,3
4645,"Didn't really like this. Not really good quality, will not use...",1
4646,MY favorite this is the best lips tick  ever and is very affordable but high quality !!,5
4647,I have long keratin treated hair & this is good for the sleep & yes breathable,4
4648,Huge money saver and a step back in time to when I watched my grandfather shave!,5
4649,I tried it almost a week. A red swollen spot appeared under both eyes. Will throw it in the trash.,1
4650,"I'm not quite sure this does what it says it's supposed to do, but for the price it's a very nice smelling perfume.",4
4651,It does not keep my  hairdo. It smashes it and is very hot to the head. Didn't send it back because of the cost.,1
4652,I couldn't find this toothbrush anywhere else but on Amazon. Got what I wanted and saved gas.,5
4653,59.99 for ten ounces when other company's price is 14.00 for two 10 oz bottles! I just wanted to ask why it's so much?,1
4654,It was okay i want buy again smell like a smell for a guy.......,4
4655,Misleading product title.  Only received one instead of a pack of four.,1
4656,This stuff is crap.  Don't waste your money.,1
4657,crap didn't fit my 7 year old. The cap was too small,1
4658,It's really pretty but it broke off way too quickly.,3
4659,"great price,i just don't care for the fruity smell",3
4660,"Sharp blades, but I cut  my face often. Went back to Atra.",3
4661,"My husband loves this.  He uses the puff traditionally, and says the other side is great for his hands, or stubborn dirt spots.",5
4662,"Unit working good, two issues, no pressure adjustment and on/off is reverse, you hold the button to stop water.",4
4663,I really like the variety it gives you. Some kind of repeat like 1 or 2 times but it's worth it.,4
4664,Very happy with this item.  I would and have recommended it to friends.  This one gets an excellent recommendation from me.,4
4665,"can never tell any difference, if it works I don't know what it does.",3
4666,"These vest were nice to look at, but by no means were close to a 2X.  They were more of a large.",1
4667,"As it claims, it cleaned deeper and less painfully than floss.",5
4668,I'm over six feet and this cape covers me very well and the material makes it easy to clean when done.,5
4669,"your mileage may vary but for me it works well and its a great price, i also like feather blades.",4
4670,"They write nicely, but the cap does tend to come off easily.",3
4671,"Pretty good concealer. Does the job, but rubs off easily.",4
4672,goes away fast and leaves an odd smell after about an hour and a half to two hours would recommend other scents,2
4673,New blades are certainly an improvement over year-old blades; and much cheaper than replacing the entire shaver. They were easy and quick to install.,4
4674,when they stick they are amazing. but sometime one will not stick and keeps falling off..but it really does make a difference.,4
4675,Had the stocking cap for all of 1 day and tge threading in the elastic band is already coming apart.,2
4676,Smelled like burnt hair. Was not a fan of this product. I do not think that I will purchase again,1
4677,Complete junk. This cape is so thin and flimsy. Don't waste your money on this purchase.,1
4678,This brush is very soft to clean the razors. I threw it away after the first use and buy the better one.,1
4679,"Pro
Cheap (cost)
Cuts well
With the grain, then Against the grain.
Lasts 3-5 shaves depending on the growth.",4
4680,"waste of money ,no difference ,finished the whole bottel and used twice ady but no result ,don`t waste your money",1
4681,"A bit disappointed, the tip was broken off upon receipt of product",3
4682,"Good heavy weight, solid construction, all metal which I wanted as my last one with a wood handle split.",4
4683,"Can not use it in professional place. Very cheap made.
Do not waste your money
Ships from Chine..",1
4684,Lens arrived needing to be popped back in. Easy fix but I feel new products shouldn't have to be fixed. Price explains quality I guess.,3
4685,This is a great soap bowl.  Good quality of wood and easy to use with a badger brush.  Would recommend to anyone.,4
4686,This cream helps tame frizz and doesn't make my hair oily at all. I will definitely be buying this again.,4
4687,I use them with the Merkur HD 34C for an unbeatable combo!,5
4688,It works as described on the brochure and totally serves the purpose. Only had to use one of the tool heads,4
4689,"Everything was great, except one bottle broke in their shipping and it was spilled in the box.  Have not spoken to the packagers yet.",4
4690,Loved this whole line. Not too harsh and really saw a difference. I like how they smell too (but not overpowering),5
4691,Love this stuff very much. It seems to work pretty well and it smells amazing.,5
4692,"I didn't notice any difference, however it is a nice cream. Won't reorder",3
4693,Not what I was looking for.  They were way too small and barely made any difference.,1
4694,"I want to know that this Norelco 7800XLCC Jet Clean System Men's Shaver of $49.99 on Amazon is new or refurbished or used.

Hello",3
4695,"This is scientology of personal hygiene equipments. Everyone outside looks at it as a crazy contraption, but every owner is LOVING it!",5
4696,The bristles are so hard I don't use it.,1
4697,It was worthless. It had very little power. Using dental floss the old fashioned way is much more successful. Do not buy!,1
4698,I love the necklace but a few of the chains have already broken and I've worn it twice.,3
4699,Everyone said it would make me sweat been using it for a week and it has not done that :(,1
4700,The product is not thick enough to combine w/  Manual Lymphatic Drainage Massage.,3
4701,Not the same as RayBan nose pads. Slightly different thickness and shape. They do work but I replaced both sides due to mismatch,2
4702,excellent product...good design...nozzle resting plastic clip broke...fixed easily...still works day after day after 3 yrs,4
4703,Pearl effect wears off in a day and looks like white plastic circles instead of pearls,1
4704,Great but a little hassle to clean every single use and i wish it was a little thinner in width,5
4705,Holds my Merkur razor and perfecto brush perfectly. Looks great in my medicine cabinet.,5
4706,"Love the scents but the bars are very thin, they break apart the first time you use them. Wish they were the sizevof regular soap bars.",4
4707,Not exactly what I expected. Wanted it for my face but not the best for that.,3
4708,Have only used it a couple of times but the battery lasts long enough for my needs and it cuts well.,4
4709,Didn't hold the razor.  Kept falling off.  Not for a Mach 3 handle.,1
4710,"The razors are not sharp enough for my liking.  Personally, it was a poor shave.",1
4711,"the top comes off easy, the cord is very short, It comes with a USB cord so you have to buy a USB to wall adapter.",3
4712,They work great for me. Don't remember how long it took to receive.  No problems. Would recommend to a friend.,5
4713,"I followed directions, and this product left my fine hair with a very dry feel - even after lots of conditioner.  Won't use again.",2
4714,I grew up with a waterpik.  Had not used one in many years.  It is a good tool for cleaning your teeth and gums.,4
4715,VERY NICE FRAGRANCE AND WORKS VERY WELL SO HAPPY I  BOUGHT IT!!!,5
4716,"Like the design, just wish it could be more bottom heavy.  Always falls over.",3
4717,bought for hubby after smelling the stick version. He likes the fresh smell but is uncomfortable the first few seconds after applying it,4
4718,Purchased as a gift. A bit smaller than expected. Arrived very quickly.,4
4719,I purchased this waterpic based on other reviews that were very favorable towards it.  I Like it.  It seems to work well and easily.,4
4720,You have to keep your breast moisturized because they will dry them out.overall I like them. There comfortable! Thank You,4

4723,Received it really fast! And it's exactly what I expected. I am totally happy with it and I will be ordering more in the future,5
4724,This oil makes my hair grow and it moisturize my hair at the same time. I will used this oil forever.,5
4725,Cheap chrome plating bubbling off.  Why are these chrome plated to start with?!,1
4726,Bought recently as I am trying to transition to more natural products. Believe the reviews. Absorbs wonderfully and smells like mint chocolate ice cream. Yum,5
4727,within 3 days some of the bristles had fallen out...,3
4728,I love this rose water! I spritz it on my face when it gets dry in the afternoons!,5
4729,These make awesome straws for when you're laying in bed and you're too lazy to lift a finger,5
4730,"Typical of an item that is good, but seldom used because it is inconvenient vs normal flossing.",3
4731,"Feels ""cheap"".  No indication of when it's going to run out of battery power.  I wonder if it's authentic.  Hmmm....",1
4732,Not Authentic Dermacol Product! I have bought Dermacol foundation on Amazon before for the same price and it was authentic! Very disappointed!,1
4733,"It is very important to maintain a shaver.
A little expensive.",4
4734,Works good in getting lashes to stick on. I have oily skin and it doesn't keep the lashes in place all day.,3
4735,Only one pair in the package.  Does its job wish I got more for my money,3
4736,"Love the feel of my skin.  Soap smells great.  The hotel soap at the Inn on  Whitworth, Love it there and ordered my own.",4

4738,"My face feels so refresh and soft after using this scrub.. a bit pricey, but  I love it, love it, love it!!!",4
4739,See my review on other Mirenesse products. Wished I would have returned especially given the price.,1
4740,I use it 3-4 per week.. I feel it is working... no major change but it does exfoliates,3
4741,"Nice face cream.  Not as thick as Skin Food, but I do like it.",4
4742,Can't really adjust the chain. But it was worth what I paid.,3
4743,Best.  Makeup. Brush. Cleanser. EVER!  Most effective one I have ever used (hi end and lo end).,5
4744,These strips helped a lot!  I have sensitivity to both hot and cold.  They lasted for a while but eventually the sensitivity returned.,4
4745,I like it a lot but the ears are kinda close together but not enough that i don't wear it,4
4746,Too small they dig into my eye sockets.  I threw them away.,1
4747,It was nothing but pure alcohol. It burned my skin.,1
4748,Just came in the mail today.  Just what I was expecting.  Very happy.  I would order again but I have so many gems now !,4
4749,"Lipstick seems alright, does not stay on very long.  Disappointed that is a product from China.",3
4750,It was the exact color I was looking for! My only issue is that it becomes a weird texture after drinking something.,4

4907,i bought this case to protect my investment in a pulse/ox and can not beat it for the price.,4

5018,This was a great product but uses a lot of batteries!,3
5019,They work well. Their flexibility makes them more comfortable.,4
5020,Everything went amazing and all that didn't come was the pen. But besides that the price needed up really well.,5
5021,This toothbrush is very gentle on my teeth and gums which usually bleed with even a super soft bristle.,4
5022,They're perfect. They're flexible and soft. I got the hot pink and the color is beautiful.,5
5023,Came just like the photo. Brushes are not made out of this world nice but they're not bad either,3
5024,"Large curling brushes are hard to find. Love it,",4
5025,I can't find another pre-electric that can compare. Also the price is right.,4
5026,"Eh, these brushes were alright. Not good quality, but durable.",3
5027,The blades restored my Norelco razer's performance to such as it was when it was new.  The blades do their job as they should,4
5028,"Smells wonderful. Feels great on hands and arms, etc.",5
5029,Does not actually repel at all but I can say it has a pleasant scent,1
5030,Worked great for 3 months and then one day it didn't work anymore,3
5031,Battery only lasts a couple of days and the usb plug in is so short it doesn't reach anything.,1
5032,got this for a gift for my in laws for christmas and have heard no complaints to this point.  fast shipment,4
5033,the tubing was crimped so gets stuck at times.  Disappointing,2
5034,A bit awkward in some ways but it works well and gets the teeth clean.,4
5035,Not a lice repellent spray. Too expensive for a regular detangler.,1
5036,Great deal it's much more quiet than my old one. I like it very much,5
5037,"This is a great help for fine hair, I've used it for three years and it really makes a difference !",5
5038,"BAD DESIGN AND IT IS VERY LOUD,MESSY,AND THE HOSE IS ALWAYS TANGLING UP. DON'T WAIST YOUR MONEY!",2
5039,In a very short amount of time the bristles fell out if the brush. I would not recommend this product.,1
5040,"The button you press to stop water flow broke right away and stayed stuck in, just made this useless otherwise i loved it",2
5041,Not very comfortable... they changed the design for the worse.,1
5042,"It worked like all creams I have used  It feel nice going on, but don't have the capacity to do the job.",3
5043,"I LIKE THE WAY IT FEELS GOING ON - COOL, GREASELESS, MOISTURINZING, BUT HAVENT SEEN ANY REMARKABLE RESULTS THUS FAR.",3
5044,Cute for the money. The magnet is a bit weak.,3
5045,"I really wish I had not purchased a rotary shaver and had gone for the straight line cut instead. Do I get a ""do-over?""
Bob",3
5046,"I was definitely pleased with the price on these. Unfortunately, they were not very shiny, other then that it was a great deal",3
5047,"Purchased two, and they both stopped working after two months.",1
5048,Does everything as advertised but I don't like the sticky residue left on my scalp.  Also it stains pillows if not washed out before sleep.,3
5049,"Not found often elsewhere, such as Sephora and other similar stores.
It's not cheap but it lasts for a long long time.",5
5050,"works well, but it's stronger than other products i have used",4
5051,"Smells like grandma's house (think perfume overload, not cookies).",1
5052,was melted when it arrived. stayed separated and couldn't use,2
5053,"so far so good. product works very well, gets close with a very even cut. very easy cleaning, great product!",4
5054,The color is a VERY light blonde...like Elsa from Frozen color blonde...plus the hair feels very cheap like a cheap costume wig...,2

5056,"Sterilize them ,neat in box small surface spots which made me wonder but otherwise i enjoy them ( arrived promptly)",4
5057,Love them! I don't think there's 3000 but there's a lot! I would recommend these if you like doing your own nails!,5
5058,Smells great but not good for your face.. perfect for baths though!,3

5062,It smells nice. It does not work very long.,2
5063,My mother uses these all the time. No complaints.,4
5064,"quite a bit lighter then expected, but not a bad shade.",4
5065,It lived up to the description.  The pause is really nice.  My old cordless one would lose power too quickly.,4
5066,"The taste is ok but the mints do not stick to the gum line very well, just to the teeth. I did not like them.",2
5067,It feels a little flimsy but I guess if you pay more you get a better brush.,4
5068,Always love neutrogena products. This one is gentle and can be used on sensitive skin.,5
5069,I have used the micro pedi for years and these refills are awful. They did absolutely nothing for me! disappointed,1
5070,"Product arrived in very good conditions and fast.
The qualiy is allright. It was made in Pakhistan.

5073,"Had for a little over 1 year, already breaking down.",1
5074,Been  using it two weeks and unable to see any difference.,2
5075,For the price I paid it wasn't bad they are just smaller then I expected,3
5076,I use this after the body wash. Both help to combat the itchy skin chlorine can cause. Nice citrus smell,5
5077,Works as expected. Great for avoiding raccoon eyes while tanning outside.,4
5078,Unfortunately you do not offer a less that one rating.  The ugliest things I have ever seen.  Dull colors and no shine.,1
5079,Works well. It doesn't smell bad. I didn't have any burning feeling or anything. I like it better than the regular veet.,4
5080,I bought these for my daughters and they love them. Perfect for little girls.  Cute case and small for little girls.,4
5081,"VERY strong, so be forewarned. However, it works!",4
5082,I ended up ordering the lotion.  It is easier to smooth and use on body.  Think this is more for the face.,3
5083,BEWARE of the content weight.  Excellent product  but 9 pounds 5.5 ounces is not 10 lb.,2
5084,I always use this product.  Works well on Kinky hair.,5
5085,Love the band but it is VERY difficult to close the clasp by myself and I ALWAYS need someone else's help.,4
5086,I'm torn between this and Cure but it's a great exfoliate.,4

5089,"The color was not true brown, it has a red tint to it.  But the quality of the donut is great!",4
5090,The smell is too much too strong if the had an unscented one it would be mine.,3
5091,"Handy and great hold. However it is shipped from overseas so don't expect ""prime shipping"" speed.",4
5092,"So happy with my purchase, my husband is happy to have an empty bathroom vanity. Order came in a timely fashion.",4
5093,"meh. It takes forever to heat up, and then it's only lukewarm - doesn't work for me.",2
5094,"The chain is too small for use by an adult, but the tag itself is nice.",3
5095,I like the product it doesn't clog my pores as my face is prone to breakouts only downside it does have a smell to it.,4
5096,This stuff works like magic for all the places you sweat that you can reach! My only complaint is the price. Pretty pricey!,4
5097,"Aparelho muito bom para uso dirio, fcil e prtico. Produto chegou antes do prazo e em perfeitas condies de entrega.",4

5099,Love this have been using for a while and I already see results (:,4
5100,Perfect fit for my bathroom! Extra roll section is perfect for the bigger rolls too...doesnt tip over.  Highly  recommended !!,5

5113,The deodorant was rough and dry inside.  It hurt my daughter's skin when she applied it.  We used it once and threw it away.,1
5114,"I didn't particularly like the toe buddy. They were sticky and lost their shape. The idea was good, but made from another material.",2
5115,What can someone say about a bar of soap? It grates well if using it to make home made dish washing liquid,4

5126,Great blades so far I shave daily and have about 4 days on these blades close comfortable shave for a great price,4
5127,"Leaves the hair soft and clean, Easy for travel.",4
5128,2weeks later n it stopped working only used it 4 times,1
5129,It works well but I ordered navy and got light blue,3
5130,Although is might fit a 22 inch head; it does not fit in depth.  So it is totally useless.  Maybe would fit a child,1
5131,"Very pretty, but the ""combs"" that hold it on jab my head and give me a headache after an hour or two.",3
5132,Very cute bracelet. Unfortunately the little bird charm fell off the first day I wore it but otherwise it is very well made.,4

5138,"nice product, especially for the price (we paid ~60 bucks)",4
5139,Excellent product as usual. A bit costly as usual.,4
5140,"Fragrance does not linger as long as I would like, but I adore Kai.",4
5141,Works well....very durable......holds a charge....easy to clean.,4

5145,works great. nice and smooth shave and makes me smell good also.,5

5160,Takes my makeup off immediately and I love the quickness and the way my skin feels afterwards.,5
5161,They were listed as lip labrets but when I received them they were extremely small,1
5162,Last a very long time (about 3 weeks) and super sexy tattoos.,5
5163,Makes me sweat -- expected Terry Cotton to be cool. Recommend for winter wear or with wet hair.,3
5164,Scam. Does not work. Used exactly as directed.,1

5177,"Some of the brushes are good, some are just ok, and a few are total rip offs.",4
5178,"One still needs to floss, but between flossing and the Water pik most everything is removed.",3
5179,Pretty bad product.  Do not buy.  Waste of money.,1
5180,"I mean, they are razor blades.  They are sharp and noting more",3
5181,"Thank you.
I received it well.
I'll use it to make it useful",5
5182,These are amazing! Worth the long shipping wait and the extra $$ for a hair tie.,5
5183,These are small but very pretty. I have worn them several times all ready.,5

5189,"The stand looks good, but my Art of Shaving brush is too big. Will be returning.",2
5190,Very red! But a good lipstick to blend with other colors so that your lips are not neon red! Brighter than MAC's Ruby Woo.,4
5191,Although it sticks to standard bra sizes it's a good standby to have if you're just a little off the mark.,4
5192,"I hoped for a cherry red color, but it goes on super dark...like a purplish/black. Goth looking on me. Ickkk...",1
5193,Not great for dry sensitive skin. Not moisturizing enough.,3

5207,"These little bottles are cute and get the job done.
They feel too fake for comfort, but they get the job done.",4
5208,Works great. Be aware the tip does get very hot on high.,5
5209,Works well...much better than Thum.  Very bitter taste but no real odor and stays on the nail even after washing hands.,4
5210,"Hey it works! What more do you have to say. Only draw back, it turns clothes white just like deoderant",4

5215,its really flimsy. you get what you pay for.,2
5216,Great product.  Easy to use and maintain.  I get a great shave without any skin irritation.,5
5217,"They don't do any better at stamping than regular nail polish.  In fact, the white is useless.",3
5218,"Seems to be pretty sturdy, and has all the layers shown. The chain from the clasp can be adjusted to be smaller or larger.",4

5228,I could not smell either of the fragrances it says.  Not sure what it smelled like actually.  I returned it.,2
5229,It was very pretty but it broke the second time I wore it. It may have been my fault. One of the jump rings came apart.,3
5230,I thought it would be more of a pink color but I still love it. It goes on smooth and dries matte,4
5231,Feels great. Doesn't hold much soap and you have to keep adding but that probably applies to all sponges. Very durable and useful.,4
5232,I gave it to goodwill.  It was awkward fitting. I got it for my daughter for her wedding night. I did not give it to her,1
5233,My physical therapist recommended this to me to help me after hand surgery.  It helps keep the stress off the surgery area of my thumb.,4

5235,"Giving as a gift. Looks well made, and the pattern and color are appealing.",4
5236,The product lasted a couple of months before overheating and now barely runs for longer than a minute.  Will never buy this again.,1
5237,Arrived as promised.  Quality replacement parts which fit and worked well.,4
5238,Sticky. I tried it a couple times and then threw it in the trash.,1
5239,They do work really well. I had them on all day and they stayed in place. Was very pleased.,4
5240,BeautyBum reconditions your skin and increases your water loss as you sweat.  it works best with rubber shorts and a waste wrap.,4
5241,Best deodorant product I ever used. Complete protection and easy application. I have tried several other leading brand products and none have offered better protection.,5
5242,I love the smell. Used it while I was traveling overseas. Price is steep though.,4
5243,Works perfectly and looks great. I wish I had gotten it sooner but better late then never!,5
5244,A friend suggested I try this for my ears and it does  work.,4
5245,"When I can put on one bracelet and have the look like I have four bracelets on, that is amazing!",5
5246,"If you own one of the larger Troy Bilt mobile power generators, this is the replacement battery to get it to start every time.",5

5254,was not as big as i thought it would be..it works,2
5255,Cute pink brushes. Very soft. Bristles keep coming out though.,3
5256,Works as expected. No problems so far. Make sure you have APPROPIATE plastic gloves or barrier between your hands and the mittens while using them,5
5257,"Didn't really do the job I was looking for. It doesn't style or smooth the hair very well, and I have very fine hair.",2
5258,Don't fit well. Corners poke inner part of your eyes.,1
5259,These flexi rods work well and I had no issues with them not bending. It's a good deal and they are good quality rods.,4
5260,Not very soft but they have lasted me a long time and I.love the case.,3
5261,"Great for your toes, keeps a space between them.",5
5262,It's really cheap and snapped in three pieces when I put ut on but I guess you get the quality you pay for.,1
5263,"Love them, you pay for what you get. But they're soft so it's nice. Took over a month to ship though.",4
5264,I gave it to a teacher so she could spray serenity on her students when they're too hyper.,5

THAT THIS PRODUCT CONTAINS CHEMICALS THAT CAN CAUSE CANCER.",2
5270,"Good to cover the white hairs, but a little bit sticky after spraying on the hair.",4
5271,Way too small for doing an inspection. Also they could use some serious magnification>,1
5272,"reservoir leaks constantly, have tried washing the valve as recommended without any success
just makes a mess, had same one before worked great",1
5273,I found this exact one with everything at walmart for 15 dollars. this is no way worth $100+,1
5274,gift for my daughter.  She loves this product and I get her a new one every couple of years.  Excellent product,5
5275,"Just filling in this block to be able to post. This thing peels paint!!! Seriously, It is awesome.  that is all",5
5276,It is very silky and the straps are wide bit however my only complaint is the strings need to be a few inches longer,4
5277,Broke after wearing it for a week. The navel ring I had before this new one lasted 6 yrs.,1
5278,"It does help with eyelid inflammation,but I wish it was even more effective",4
5279,"So far, so good. Suction cups stick nicely and the pillow is very comfy!",4
5280,For the price this is a good system. I have checked at local establishments and they were asking $70-150 for them.,4
5281,I love the quality of this product though I could do without the triclosan and phthalates.,4
5282,Ordered the Ginger Andalou and the smell is so disgusting I can't use it!  Don't recommend this at all!,1
5283,"These were smaller than I expected, barely covering what they needed to. Good price though, and came when they said they would.",4
5284,"Wish they had more colors to choose this would have been much better as a gift idea for others, .",4
5285,"Doesn't work!  I bought because it was rated 5stars, but it didn't work.",1
5286,"Unit lost pressure after minimal use, very disappointed in quality . Have had other waterpik products and never had a problem .",1
5287,"Did not work for me. Pushes second toe on top of third one, so it just causes another problem.",1
5288,"Great color, no orange looking tan.  Nice looking sun kissed coloration and super fast acceleration to a dark tan!",5
5289,Enjoying this product. I use it for touch ups between colorings. Wish it was a little more powder-like.,4
5290,Cute color just not for me .. maybe for a lighter skin person it would show better,3
5291,"good moisturizing.  sort of light.  if you have really dry skin, you might prefer the spray aquaphor which is much thicker.",4
5292,"Good product, just took over a month to get it.",4
5293,"Christmas present.
My son loves the variety. Inviting look.
Efficient packaging. Arrived in a few days.  :)",5
5294,Extremely soft bristles. Medium quality. Nice pink color. Applies make up ok.,2
5295,"Quick delivery. Gives my skin a nice, clean feeling.",4
5296,"The wipes were yellow, I'm assuming they were very old. Threw them away.",1
5297,Burns like crazy and smells harsh. I don't even think it helps the razor glide better.,1
5298,Have not used these yet.  Been experiementing with other creations.  I have used stickers before and liked them. Will order more.,4
5299,"Can't say I saw immediate results, but they are really refreshing!  I will use them again!",4
5300,I have extremely sensitive skin and highly recommend this product.  I am getting the promised results without the irritation many retinol products cause.,5
5301,Burns my face up with crazy minty flavor. Exactly what I want. Scope does the trick on my stink mouth. Probably will yours too.,5
5302,Brought my estradiol down from 50 to 33. I'm a male.,4
5303,It is perfect for longer hair.  It gives just enough curl to not look strait.  It is easy to pack for trip as well.,5
5304,These fell apart within 1-2 wears. I do not recommend,1
5305,"Fekkai is a well known hair product.
This little package was perfect for traveling.
I can refill the little bottles before the next trip.",4
5306,"It's a decent comb, it is durable and is just the right size.  However, its just a comb.",3
5307,"Reason for 1 less star
Noisy
Water tank is small. I have to refill it at least once before I finish.",4
5308,Works very well so far. Have only used it a few times. Just wish it were water proof.,4
5309,"Not too oily, smell good, and makes my cuticles less dry.  Would recommend.",4
5310,"This shampoo cleans my hair well, lathers well, and smells good.",5
5311,"Perfect!  I could not find a 3/4 "" drying brush anywhere and I can't use a larger one - so it was a great find.",5
5312,When I ordered I thought I was to receive more than one bag.  This is a waste of my money.,3
5313,Nothing spectacular as my wife and i were expecting. She claims the extra angle doesn't do any justice.,2
5314,I have been using this product in my son's hair since he was 2. It smells lovely and makes his curls look great and not dry.,5
5315,"Works well but way too loud and bulky; quality is on the low end and whenever you want to clean it, the head is falling apart.",2
5316,"Don't even bother, it's watered down rubbing alcohol. You can purchase a large bottle of rubbing alcohol for less and get better results.",1
5317,"Pkg is bent and can't give it as a gift., I will have to find another present for a friend. but not from Aum",2
5318,great color. it is matte. smells pretty good. leaves my lips a little chalky sometimes.,4

5320,good for my gel nail service have been using them since my purchase,4
5321,Not like I expected but still pretty colors. Good for the price (:,3
5322,not a strong smell of argan oil but this lathers up well with just a little bit. leaves skin really clean,4
5323,Mine has no fragrance. Does this mean it is old? I was looking forward to the lovely fragrance I read about.,2
5324,I love the power and design but sometimes the comb level changer gets stuck and it is annoying to fix it. Overall - Recommended.,4
5325,"Excellent product, have bought more, perfect for Sonos 1.",5
5326,Took too long to process order. Poor quality.  These can only be used once and the elastic is poorly attached.,3
5327,Bad product. Cant use wet. Broke less than a month after purchase,1
5328,When the clippers came in both pair were not sharp enough to cut my cuticle. Still trying to figure out how to sharpen them. Very dissatisfied,1
5329,I couldn't finish the bottle so can't tell if it works or not. Pills have a very strong vitamin smell that I could not bare.,1
5330,Awesome product! Highly recommend. Much cheaper than buying in-store . I have been using this for a few years now and woulnt switch.,5
5331,They're alright. OPI has drying drops for about the same price that are way better,3
5332,"This is the second time I have ordered this product. It does work! It is not attractive, but serves the purpose.",4
5333,This makes my cyatic acne better after just one application. It's not completely healed but the inflammation and redness is greatly reduced,4

5335,"Very handy for all trimming, holds charge, easy to clean.",5
5336,"five blades, good razor, smooth shave, nice flow and feels nice in my hand - smaller hands so that was nice.",4
5337,"I use these every time I go, but I'm not sure they are working.  Better than nothing I guess.",3
5338,"Really nice bracelet....my daughter loved it.  The photo does not due justice. Really nice accessorey.
Ordered another one in a different color.",4
5339,Horrible. They lasted 3 hours and fell apart while doing a customer hair! Do not purchase!,1
5340,Great drugstore matte powder to use with the matte bb cream.  Proves you don't have to spend tons on makeup to look good!,5
5341,Does not lather. I bought 3 bottles and they are all the same :(,1
5342,I found them too thin and pliable to be effective.,1
5343,Love this. I have had a few nicks when shaving it stops the bleeding and helps to heal quickly,3
5344,"The iron is okay but it came too late for the date I needed it, I think it made a tour of the U.S.",3
5345,I've been using Aquaphor for years. I use it on scabs and chapped lips it goes on nice and smooth can be very greasy too,4
5346,I upgraded from a much older version and am happy my choice.  I like the features but will only use the basic style tips.,4
5347,"Have been using daily for nearly 2 weeks. No difference yet. Fingers crossed!

*It is light, dries quickly, and has a mild scent.",3
5348,Did like the way it felt on my hair.  Lathered well but left a 'film'.  ended up using it as a body wash.,2
5349,Unfortunately this entire line caused me to break out horribly.,1
5350,"Feel kinda goofy writing a review for stuff like this, but...it works well.

Rich",4
5351,No need to purchase the more expensive updates to this unit.  Works well with almost no nicking or pulling.,4
5352,"Terrible! My hair turned out red not brown and broke me out bad, thought it was natural, no PPD or ammonia.",1
5353,"Arrived today and gave it a shot.  The bristles came flying out everywhere, both sides.  Poor, poor  quality.",1
5354,string is too short to fit properly on my very normal sized head.,3
5355,I like this product however it starts to chip at the free edge and cuticle area. I would recommend this product.,4
5356,The button on the handle sticks making it very difficult to use without spraying your bathroom with water.,1
5357,"Just a little darker than she expected, but nice product.",4
5358,"really bad quality, I return the  item as soon as I open the package",1
5359,Nest products are the best. A bit pricey but worth the price.,5
5360,I had to stop using this black soap after a few days because it burned my skin-,3
5361,This came broken and smells horrible. Threw it out.,1
5362,Do not buy.  The prongs on the brush side are so close together that the brush will not fit on the stand.  A waste of money.,1
5363,I just started using this product. The only issue I have is that it is too loud. Hopefully it works since my dentist recommend it.,4
5364,It is an okay product but good for the cheap price.,3
5365,I am a repeat customer and so far I have 2 family members using it,5
5366,Ive been cutting hair since I was 15 and this is by far the best razor handle ive used. Its even better cause it uses injector blades,5
5367,When i received it a shadow hadbeen broken and had gotten over everything.,3
5368,My wife likes the clean scent which reminds her each time of our many trips to the Island.,4
5369,Great to hear see I could get th refill on line.,4
5370,I have never used a waterpik before at age 50 and I love it! I would highly recommend this product,5
5371,Great product to control acne...made my face look flawless,5
5372,"This set is a joke, looks like a toy set. No recommended. Buy something better $10 or $20 bucks more.",1
5373,"This is an improvement over the prior razors but needs to have a heavier feel, to light.",3
5374,"Excellent product, great quality. I used it to make organic deodorants and they came out great.",5
5375,Leaves your frontal white don't like it and then if u spread it thin it comes a loose,2
5376,I like the way the brushes organized and it is really cheap. It is a good choice for starter.,4
5377,"Not as good as I thought it would be. Not happy with, will not get again.",2
5378,This is Cute and just like the description and photo.  Thank You.,4
5379,Total waste of money. Slips off with the slightest sweat and actually doesn't work at all when it doesn't.,1
5380,Very pleased with this product.  I use it all the time and it still works great after many months!,5
5381,I've been using this cream for years. I love the way my skin feels!,4

5383,Adorable.  This was a huge hit at my baby shower and the headbands are so sweet.,5
5384,"Why do, being a prime member, I paid the same amount for two but only for one product? Does not make any sense...",2
5385,Sharp and smooth!  I like them better than the Feather Blades!,4
5386,I am  so very pleased with these replacements.  They Work very well.  These cost much more in my hometown stores.,4
5387,"I love this stuff. It actually starts to work right after you put it on. It also uses herbs and botanicals that make your skin glow,",5
5388,"It's complicated to use, very messy, and doesn't do a good of removing hair.",2
5389,This was for my husband and he is very happy with it.,5
5390,my FAVORITE eyelash glue. dries at the perfect speed and the texture is great,5
5391,"After receiving it, I was billed again by the manufacturer!  I wouldn't buy anything from them again.",1
5392,Thanks La Lune for getting my product out so fast!  I can't wait to make up some soothing goodies from this jewel!,5
5393,"The steamer would not turn on just after two uses. Crap!
Do not waste your money.",1
5394,Not like it use to be. This stuff started breaking me out.,2
5395,This color wouldn't look good on any skin tone!,1
5396,"COMPACT, EASY TO USE, MANY ATTACHMENTS. HAS IMPROVED MY GUM HEALTH ALREADY IN LESS THAN A MONTH AS CONFIRMED WITH MY DENTIST.",5
5397,I bought 2 caps and both ripped within a week. I'll let the pictures speak for themselves,2
5398,This did nothing. I do not notice a single improvement. I guess my money was wasted.,1
5399,"Poor fit for smaller wrist and not enough links to adjust the size. Looks soft and leather-like, but plastic instead.",2
5400,I do not like this product for my curly course hair.  My hair is dry already and I feel like it strips my hair of any moisture.,1
5401,I like this product but wish the fingers were a little longer,3
5402,A nice light hold without any noticeable residue. Would have given five stars if the hold made it through the day.,4
5403,Junk omg...so hard to make them stay in hair and they look so ridiculous. Smell pretty weird too. Pretty bad purchase.,1
5404,This toner keeps my skin feeling pretty good after I clean my face.  My daughter uses it too and she is pleased with it.,4
5405,Why do cosmetics manufacturers put scent in their products?  I threw this away as the scent was awful.  Use at your own risk.,2
5406,So much better than regular flossing I finally feel like I am getting a deep clean every morning and evening and its so convenient!,4
5407,My husband says it is a very good shaver but the cord comes out too easily and has to be reconected while shaving.,4
5408,So far i like it. My breast and butt feel firmer. Would definitely recommend.,4
5409,Heads to fit the excellent Airfloss. One draw back is a lack of space on the machine to place them.,4
5410,They would have been cute if they didn't come in broken and bent,1
5411,"My electric shaver is pretty clean, so I guess it's working.",5
5412,It doesnt look same as the picture....material is cheap,2
5413,Extremely thick. Brings out every bump and scar on my face.,1
5414,Hmmmm. Works on cracked feet BUT seems to be no different than straight petroleum jelly. Can buy Vaseline for much cheaper.,3
5415,My husband was glad to be able to get these replacements,4
5416,Works well but for the price it should last a lot longer - max 2 weeks and then it loses its stick.,3
5417,"Love this product! The scent is subtle, fresh and it leaves your skin feeling soft.",5
5418,"Shaver just works great as advertised, had one earlier that lasted more than 5 years...Thanks to Amazon for speedy shipping.",4
5419,"Beautiful product, which is weird since it just holds a razor but it's very handsome in my bathroom.",5
5420,"This is great!  Fits easily on the bathroom counter, adjusts so that various members of the family can choose thier pressure intensity--",5

5422,"Good, It is good as I thought. Good~ Good~ Good~ Good~ Good~ Good~ Good~ Good~ Good~ Good~ Good~  Good~ Good~",4
5423,10pcs they ask size but I got like 4 different sizes and stones are not as pretty colors as online.,1
5424,It was broken when I received it and the packing was horrible. I had to return it.,1
5425,This was NOT Paloma Picasso Eau De Parfum. It was a cheap generic similar to insect repellent.,1
5426,My favorite color--very natural. long lasting. The only blush compact I've ever used that hasn't ended up cracking sometime during use.,4
5427,The stud is way too tiny. I dropped one and can't find it anywhere. The fit isn't too bad.,2
5428,Very very smooth lipstick - exactly as described EXCEPT color . This is way more of a red color than the dark pinky brown that is shown,4
5429,"The middle button for the colored lights don't work, we were super excited to use this for my 1.5yr old daughter but it didn't work.",1
5430,"Just love the tingling feeling on my skin after using this product, and it looks like my blackheads in my nose are cleaner",5
5431,Item came busted open and the contents leaked and spilled inside of the plastic packaging.,1
5432,"Nothing like photo. Dark, neon pink color. Yuck",1
5433,"The replacement parts reached after 3 months, hence i already bought a new quad-copter...",1
5434,"Just added this to the ""wasted my money"" list!",1
5435,This cleanser works extremely well but be careful as it may dry out your skin.,4
5436,Easy to install but the head pack is expensive!  They should separate the foil from the blades since the foil is the first part to go.,3
5437,Too expensive. Leaves a heavy film on hair that won't rinse out. Better for use as a body wash only.,3
5438,"I am very pleased with this trimmer -- so far, it is working very well.",4
5439,Very cute. However after some time the stone falls off and leaves behind the silver backing.,3
5440,"Nice scent, use for Airbnb. Does not last too long so apply on day the guest will be arriving. Not overpowering at all.",4
5441,The hold of this is not as good as i expected,3
5442,"Very good for travels. Could be easier to clean inside, but does a very good job. I recommend.",4
5443,"I ordered it because it can get rebate back. However, it does not qualify rebate as they described before, although the product is not bad.",3
5444,Might be my hair but they don't stay put very well.,3
5445,Run a little small for anyone over a size 12...but most can squeeze in them.,4
5446,Good soap. Keeps me from feeling all dried out. This offer is too expensive. Can buy it much cheaper at grocery store.,3
5447,"If there were half a star I'd have put it there.  Strips did next to nothing.
Tried them twice.  Followed directions.  Nothing!",1
5448,Lipstick was dried out and wouldn't apply onto lips. May have been old product that I received. Had to throw it away upon delivery.,1
5449,it worked fine. but it didn't last long.,4
5450,There has been no change in my skin. I will not purchase another SK-II product!,1
5451,Not worth the price.poor design and not a quality wood work. Too smaller than it appears and not as good looking as its highlighted in the picture.,2
5452,Product works well but has a smell to it which my daughter hates!,2
5453,Not what I expected. Chain was way to big for me than how it looks in the picture. Very disappointed .,1
5454,Smells like Rose petals and a little goes a long way.,4
5455,"The serum is sticky and difficult to wash off, even with Oz's fine Vitamin C cleanser.  Many scrubs are necessary.",1
5456,"Good product.
4 stars, because the cloth material is rougher than i thouht.
it should be smoother",4
5457,"Very poorly made, may of the colors are not in the pack and may of the stones are glued in crooked or not at all",2
5458,"It works great, super hydrating! I love putting this on right after I shower.",5
5459,"It was a lot that was the same , and one of my balls broke",2
5460,Can't quite get the neck small enough for my kids,4
5461,This is the best.  The only one I use.,5
5462,"Not really satisfied on this product, I don't see any difference",2
5463,Correct and fast delivery. The appliance corresponds to the description. Reliable teeth and mouth help,5
5464,TRIS PRODUCT HAS NOT WORKED THUS FAR.HOPE IT DOES.MAYBE IT WILL.I HAVE NEVER FOUND A PRODUCT THAT GET RID OF DARK SPOTS WASTED MONEY.,3
5465,Good full size products for a low price! Truly an amazing buy!,5
5466,"This gets the hair an does the job, but it could be built more for thick hair.",3
5467,"It's ok, not great quality but they do the job.",3
5468,"Smells wonderful, but scent does not linger at all on body. It does make me feel clean without any residue left on my skin.",3
5469,works very well. holding tip is a little small. heats up pretty fast. makes a straighter curl. gets perfect hot,4
5470,Probably too soon to tell but I don't see a difference after several applications.,3
5471,Finally a shaver for the manly areas which is pretty safe and works in the shower.  Works very well and Handles all the areas quite readily.,4
5472,Love the razor.  Great shave.  I probably won't continue to use due to price of refill cartridges.  Overall good deal.,4
5473,"I really like these oils,  much more affordable compared to the price of Young Livings' oils and smell just as good.",4
5474,"Came as stated and daughter enjoyed the gift ,,, came on time",4
5475,Pretty necklace love it the only thing that keep me from rating higher is that it gets tangled I spent an hour trying to untangled very annoying.,3
5476,"Bought it as a possible relief for lichen planus, but it had no effect on my condition.",1
5477,Don't really see a difference. Doesn't ever seem to absorb and rubs off on everything regardless of how long I wait. Smells nice though.,3
5478,Didnt make my makeup mirror any brighter.  Disappointed.  Wish I didn't have to buy 2.  What a waste,3
5479,"Product looked different from the one pictured.
Also don't think it worked.
So i decided to make Hulda clark liver flush. That one worked..!",2
5480,"Adjustable straps and does  the job.
It was worth the money and should last for quite some time.  I use it with my infrared led light.",4

5482,"Im just star using this product and the sweat star decreased ..no smell feed at all, feel comfortable all day.... thanks amazon",5
5483,Died after one use. Battery won't charge again.,1
5484,Bought it for Myself as well as for my son. Received within a few days. Great product. User-friendly. Easy to clean.,4
5485,"Trays are too small
Whitening gel is nearly impossible to distribute evenly
My teeth were aching for days
This product is 100% garbage",1
5486,This is a heavy oil from others that I have purchased.  Fine for hair and skin but not so much for the face.,3
5487,"These blades don't irritate my face unlike a few others, after the weekend beard grows Monday morning these blades are like butter.",5
5488,This is a really cute belly button I thought the heart would be smaller though,4
5489,a bit darker that I expected but still a nice product,4
5490,Slowly starting to fall apart. Also had to scrub in your bum...,3
5491,The blades seem to be the same as they were many years ago.  Just fine.,4
5492,It was not effective. I found that the Toms all natural deodorant worked better for my kid. Do NOT waste your money with this!,1

5494,Great for the price!!!!!!!,5
5495,Everything was great except I didn't actually receive the hair trap piece.,3
5496,wanted to have something I could wear under my socks for the day but these only last a bit.,3
5497,Next time I need to make sure to target thinner people. This does not fit the average american body.,3
5498,very good product..!! Really worth the money. Would definitely buy another product soon. Would love if provided some special discounts.,5
5499,It is a a nice fabric but it doesn't stay on at night without adding an additional headband,3
5500,Nothing wrong with the product. Only complaint is that the picture does not match the color green I received which was a disappointment.,3
5501,Did nothing to enhance my silver/gray hair...it did make it like straw...Boom...in the trash it went!,1
5502,They don't glow in the dark. But I like some of the colors.,1
5503,I hadn't used this is years.  It's OK. Does what it's supposed to.  I think.,3
5504,"Amazon, by far had the lowest price on this 12 pack of Mach 3 cartridges.",5
5505,Great comb. It seems very solid. The customer service is excellent!,5
5506,"gift for my sister, she loves them.  great value.",4
5507,"These things are just not comfortable, no matter what size or brand I get.  Otherwise it does it's job.",4
5508,The softer side came dirty with some red substance on it.. I washed it off. Seems like a good tool besides the fact it came dirty.,3

5515,"This product arrived the following week, and gave me no problem during the last several months.  Good value for a new product.",4
5516,Not convinced it is worth the money. I bought it for my curly hair.,3
5517,Eau de Hadrien is my favorite of the Annick Goutal line & the lotion is lovely.,5
5518,i was charged and found out that this product is fake!  Want my money back and will take back my rating!,1
5519,This may not be the best grooming system available but I think for the price it has tremendous functionality.,4
5520,eND SPONGE BOKE AFTER TWO USES - PLASTIC IT FITS ONTO PUSHED RIGHT THROUGH,1
5521,Goes on easy and lasting without greasiness. Also very large size a good bargain.,4
5522,Cheap chain broke in seconds. All around cheap but cute .,1
5523,was smaller than I expected and very flimsy - maybe 5 dollars better price,2

5528,"Bought two. Came with one empty.
The second one was half full, didn't even want to use it.",1

5693,False advertisement. I got 20 rings but only 5 different colors. Definatly was not a variety like I had hoped. Very dissapointed.,2
5694,Product is the right one but I feel that blades are not sharp enough for the cut. It might be a feeling or related to something else.,4

5802,I have been using Nars blush for over 8 years.  This is the best color for everyone.  It has just the right amount of shimmer!,5
5803,Good pigment. Small amount goes a long way so it lasts a long time.,5
5804,Pretty sure it was a knock off. I have had the real thing and it was stronger and lasted much longer. Waste of 65.00.,2
5805,I'm 35 and I think this smell fits my age and my wife loves it surprisingly. Customer service was A+++,4
5806,"Excellent product, will save you a lot of money from going to a podiatric, when you can do it at home.",5
5807,"The perfect way to keep your teeth and gum and best shape, and the best way to save in deep cleaning...",5
5808,"Wasn't sure what it would smell like, bought it for the Yankees theme, it is fine. Wold suggest for any Yankee fan.",4
5809,It's ok. I've been using it for a few months now and it's starting to fray already but still does the job.,3
5810,"Product is good, however, the teeth are a bit too long to effectively grab shorter hair.",4
5811,"Wasted money.
Didn't fade anything and didn't work at all.
Disappointing to spend a lot on a product that didn't work :(",1
5812,Completely different then what I got before. It was hard and white colored instead of soft and yellow,1
5813,Yo use esta peineta cuando tena 15 aos pero era suave esta es dura y hace doler al agarrar el cabello :-( no Good,2
5814,"works great, lasts a long time during those hot n sweaty moments, keeps you feeling just like it says, fresh and dry.",4
5815,"Initialy i used to feel a bit of iritations but now my skin has accepted this new shaving system.
the best thing is no more cuts now.",4
5816,Seeing great results in less breakage fewer wild squirrelly knots and healthier thicker hair.,5
5817,great and stays on but i wish it came with the glue,4
5818,Took forever to get to me. Case seemed cheap.,2
5819,The price is the selling point.  And they do a decent job.,4
5820,it was cute but it broke after the second time I used it.,3
5821,great little tote.  well made.  we use it for quick trips with the babies.,4
5822,The brushes are pretty small but I still would recommend.. love these brushes & the color,4
5823,"These bath salts do smell like real lavender, and turn bathing into a luxurious experience.  They would make a nice but inexpensive holiday gift.",4
5824,Horrible product! Turns on by light lit but DOES NOT heat up my oil. A waste of money,1
5825,"After all the time waited, I received the wrong color!!!
BLONDE",1
5826,My favorite scent for personal care but out is not sold in retail stores anymore. Would order in bulk but cannot justify the marked up price.,4
5827,"Didn't work on my skin nearly as well as for some of the other reviewers. For me, just not worth the price.",3
5828,"I like the scent, it just doesn't last very long. Very clean. Not too heavy smelling which is great. No headaches from this.",4
5829,the foam tip broke off almost immediately. great idea but needs work,2
5830,"didn't work as effectively as I would hope, after waiting the right amount of time I still feel the pain.",2
5831,"Clears my face almost instantly the next day, feels refreshing as well!",5
5832,This was fake!!! The lid's pointy thing had edges whereas the original has a smooth rounded point. So disappointing.,1
5833,Cured severe cystic acne that I battled for years. I have been using this product for 5+ years and I will NEVER live without it.,5
5834,"Odd texture, wears out quickly unlike the earth therapeutic brand cloth.",2
5835,"For the price it will work, but should have spent a bit more and bought a better one.",3
5836,It was very good at first. But it may hurt your ear a little and it broke after about 3-4 days,4
5837,"Goodness. If you even slightly perspire at night, don't bother with this.",1
5838,This came broken and smells horrible. Threw it out.,1
5839,The shaver is very convenient to clean.  Battery lasts longer than I expected--4 weeks of daily shaving.,4
5840,Very nice color. It's a very good value for the quality of this lipstick.,3
5841,There wern't any clips on this piece so I have to pin it on myself.  Not very good quality.,2
5842,It works..lots of pressure..it does what is supposed to do. Now is just a question of reliability...So fat so good,5
5843,Only just for lay down.. Cant really see through them.. Not worth it,1
5844,I used to use these blades quite awhile ago.............still the same............but there are better choices now.,3
5845,"You won't be disappointed.  Provides healing after razor burn, and moisturizing.  I would highly recommend this product for my brothers in baldness!",5
5846,great variety of brushes...good carry case..I am able to apply makeup beautifully with these brushes...a great buy at a great price,4
5847,too big i think for it to pass as a real nose ring,1
5848,Makes my set very suave and gentlemanly :) thank you for the stellar quality product!!,5
5849,I liked the cream but it does not have a pump. I could not use it all. Wasted my money.,2
5850,Great scissors! Excellent value. Very well balanced and comfortable.,4
5851,excellent product. I noticed a difference after a few applications.  My teetch became noticably whiter very quickly.,5
5852,"causes rough skin, break out of some skin rash, not good for me",1
5853,Its a great choice for the money. Very easy to use.,4
5854,Total disappointment. Wouldnt even classify them as travel size.,1
5855,"It didn't do anything at all, it looks like oil and cream. The oil comes out first then the cream..really gross",1
5856,"Smells fresh, moisturizes ok. Don't like thick (viscous) texture.",3
5857,The only thing I didn't liked is that the hair container is SUPER fragile. The rest is great.,4
5858,Did not relieve itching as I hoped.  May have to move to the shower gel to help but not at this point.,3
5859,Didn't realize they were so small!  Way overpriced!  But good for travel,2
5860,Gums were burning the entire time. Now have an open sore. Verry little pleasant results. Teeth minimally whiter. Spend the $ for Crest.,1
5861,set to son for christmas gift.he is very satisfied with this product and would recommend it to anyone.,5
5862,"Love the product! Wish the hoses lasted longer before breaking, but at least they can be easily replaced.",4
5863,I am a little disappointed in the quality of the broom. I will look for a better and stronger model next time,2
5864,I used the black color and after two hours of application I still got a blond color.,2
5865,I always liked Glide dental floss and being able to purchase it in a large quantity on line is great.,5
5866,SO incredibly bad in every single way possible. Save your money and DO NOT BUY!,1
5867,The product was okay but not impressed in comparison to other products.,3
5868,My burps are horrible after swallowing this. :( only freshened  for like 1 hour.,2
5869,i have a thick beard and these do ok. id prefer to spend a little extera and get the feathers but these are good.,3
5870,GRANDSON LOVED IT.  HE WAS HOME FROM OVERSEAS AND WILL TAKE IT BACK WITH HIM THE MIDDLE OF THE MONTH,5
5871,"good price for a generic product. fits Oral-B brush pretty well.  Little noisier than the OEM brush, but most people would never notice.",4
5872,Nothing special. You can purchase Witchhazel from the healthcare aisle.,2
5873,I use this to clean my hera cushion sponges. works great.,5
5874,This product did not fit out hygea pump at all. My wife returned these because they worked so poorly.,1
5875,"Been using this soap for years.... The smell was not the same ...will not purchase it again online
Except direct from Plantlife ;((",1
5876,I use this for a diaper bag because milk and food are always spilling. It looks like a purse so I take it everywhere!,5
5877,Rings are great. Just realize you aren't getting silver. They come in different colors that are all bright.,4
5878,"While I'm sure this is good quality product, I found it was less costly to purchase a new Norelco 6940 shaver set from Amazon.",1
5879,I have not seen any results. I've used it as directed but nothing.,1
5880,Husband is old school and loves this double edge.  Hard to find blades in store so this seemed like a good value and good reviews.,4
5881,makes a decent clay mask when mixed with Thayer's Witch Hazel w/Rose Extract,4
5882,Effective at removing food debris from between teeth! Low pressure setting is gentle on gums. Can put xylitol rinse in water container.,4
5883,"I love this thing! The battery lasts surprisingly long and the different attachments come in handy!!
Great product for the price.",5
5884,does a great job of cleaning teeth but it makes a lot of mess especially when putting the handle away,4
5885,"This brush seem to be of good quality.  The bristles are very solt and full, and fit tightly inside the ferrule.",5
5886,vaseline will do the same thing at a lesser$$$,2
5887,it's so effective you can even skip a day (not really but i like it anyway),4
5888,I haven't gotten it yet because I ordered it today but I'm hoping it will be good for me to use,5
5889,Have had zero issues with.  The wand is a little large but is manageable,4
5890,I love it so much I'm buying it again absolutely wonderful,5
5891,"Good stuff. Smells good. Control, but doesn't matt your hair down too much.",4
5892,Does not secure the bar of soap at all... no different than a loofah.,1
5893,I used this for my neck. It actually burnt my neck. I haven't used it again.,1
5894,Thos stays on for hours. Nice color. Would buy again,4
5895,I've been using this product for months and have seen no difference. Current bottle will be my last.,2
5896,"Lightweight, smells nice, and moisturizing without weighting down your hair. A little bit goes a long way so the bottle last a long time.",5
5897,Not as good as original nads.  I thought these strips would be easier.  I'm going back to the original nads in a jar.,2
5898,"Excellent, scent does not last too long but nice old timey tonsorial parlour product",5
5899,Very nice quality brushes. Case is nice and easy to use.,4
5900,The case is beautiful with a lot of brushes but they are very soft therefore they aren't good to make up.,2
5901,Ok for the price..not much smell.  The price was right for this..but it does not last long...has a very weak smell to it..,3
5902,"Does not help my hair curl, gives it a very small amount of body if used when my hair is slightly wet.",1
5903,"I like that it's for kids, but it didn't work very well at all.",2
5904,As this product is sold for the US market. Make sure you convert to the correct voltage according to your region b4 charging.,4
5905,These gloves ripped in a matter of a few uses. Would not buy again.,1
5906,"Matches my skin tone, off nude alternative to a pink or brown nude",4
5907,I made it looks so professional and so much better than it was when it arrived. My granddaughter still loved it,3
5908,Made my skin dry and the review was so fake.,1
5909,"It is a good shaver with low price.
Shaving is easy with this shaver and also less time consuming
Treamer is also very good.",4
5910,"Too pasty, not easy to comb hair when applied.",1
5911,"works better that floss at removing food stuck between teeth & gum.
Use it before I floss with Plackers.  Should also work well on braces.",4
5912,"This is the best anti-bacterial body wash I have ever tried, but not harsh on skin.  I love it.",5
5913,First Day i used it made it look like I went to the dentist. Teeth came out really clean and cleaned out my gums,5
5914,#1 cream for my 2 month baby and 2 year old baby!,5
5915,love..Bought for goody bags for my daughters 10th b-day party..Huge hit!!,4
5916,"Despite the bad reviews about the product I bought it, and I don't regret about. This shaver is what I need, specially for travelling.",4
5917,I really like these makeup wipes. They work rest for waterproof eye make up.  Great for on the go.,5
5918,"Cute product. These have a clear background, you paint your nails first in white, or whatever color you want, then put these over.",4
5919,"These lasted for 3 shaves -- all of the cartridges.  The other varieties of cartridge are great, though.",1
5920,Fits well but the gold buckels tarnish after one or two washes. I'm sure they can be removed and replaced if you desired to do so.,3
5921,"Didnt worked for me, wasn't sharp enough as others have pointed !! Can only use once plus it doesnt give me a close shave",2
5922,Women seem to always want to sniff me when I'm out and about...great product!,5
5923,I love this stuff.  It smells great & really leaves your legs smooth & moisterized.,5
5924,"In the picture you only see I  one container, but when you receive it it's two. This is awesome. The rhinestones come very organized.",5
5925,"Simply the best! Won't run  & sting eyes.
Perfect! Lasts. Can take on airplane carryon.
Prevents sunburn",5

5928,really needed it to dry hair but it takes too long . did not work for me.,2
5929,It arrive fine and in good condition; but I was disappointed that it did not have the same fragrance that I remember.,3
5930,Wife hated these because they did not cut as well as much cheaper scissors,2
5931,I really dislike these shears they are not sharp they bend the hair and are too small who uses shears this tiny wouldn't buy again,1
5932,Perfect! Just beware to apply lightly...color is very intense.,5
5933,"I`ve used this brand for years, for some reason this new one isn`t as powerful as the ones I`ve had before.  Alittle disappointed.",3
5934,it took a week to deliver. Product is recommended.,3
5935,It's great when gray starts to take over your roots. Just spray and go washes right out,5
5936,I could not be more disappointed in this trimmer.  It does not trim closely enough at all.,1
5937,It is good to clean the shaver. Whenever I use it to clean the shaver reduces irritation of my skin,3
5938,Didn't work for easing discomfort at all. Didn't stay in place well.,2
5939,"They are okay, just not a sharp as others I have bought.",3
5940,These aren't even what's listed. They aren't clear and they aren't triangular shaped whatsoever,2
5941,Very good product if you wear compression stockings - it helps keep them from sliding down and it washes off in water.,4
5942,My mom loves it !!! Has not been able to clean between toes in a long time,5
5943,Ok I can't get the curl I want with it,2
5944,"The handle of the dryer got so hot.  Smell like burning the plastic, harmful smell, poor quality.",1

5948,"It's a nice purse, love the pocket in the front for your phone. Cute and nicely made, big for a lot of items!",3
5949,the bottles themselves are great but the spray nozzles are TERRIBLE!  they constantly leak all over your hand when you spray them.,1
5950,Great customer service and a great product which has won the test of time.,5
5951,Smells really nice. Easy to apply feels light and not greasy.,4
5952,It is ok. I use it for dance it seems a little dry the color is really good and it last for a whole performance.,4
5953,I love this stuff. Good for really dry skin and sore skin. I use it as a lip balm too.,5
5954,Seems to work OK. Still on my first cartridge.,4
5955,Cute but really too small for an adult's ears. Perfect for a young child.,3
5956,"SAVE YOUR SELF THE XTRA 75 BUCKS AND JUST GET THE 9160XL SAME RAZOR JUST WITH OUT THE USELESS DIGITAL FEATURE, THAT ISNT REALLY NEEDED",4
5957,This was the most hyped up junk ever.  It dried and tangled my hair like it was full of chemicals.  Wasted money for sure!,1
5958,All of them are very nice. Except for the vanilla - it stinks.,4
5959,This is an easy way to take Carr of Your teeth!  Dentist recommended. Get one soon!,4
5960,"Repeat customer.  Recommended by massage place, it makes a great bath that is relaxing and great for sore muscles.",5
5961,The knife is ultra dull and won't cut anything. The spoon and fork are clumsy for me at this time.,2
5962,The grit added to the bar can hurt if you scrub too vigorously but the smell is sooooo worth it!,4
5963,Does not performance as well as original parts in the shaver.  Must be a knock off pieces and not OEM replacement.,2
5964,"I only used it a few times so far, but works fairly well.  I will use it again in the future.",4
5965,It works great. It toies around the neck and gets the job done.  It keeps hair off nicely. Good product,4
5966,I think this color may be good for pretty much any complexion.,4
5967,"It works...for $19.99 or .30Cents a drop, it betterf work The value of the produce is  over priced...too damn much.",3
5968,this works best for me in the summer months when you sweat the most THANKS,5
5969,"This is a great tool - I love how compact it is, and how easy to clean it is, too. Highly recommended!",4
5970,I went to open the pouch and it fell apart.  My money was promptly refunded.,1
5971,I purchased at a beauty supple store to try it out.  It matted my hair and didn't hold my edges as noted.,1
5972,no white or sweat patches but chunks break off the stick,3
5973,i am not even sure why this was bought but i'm sure it was great,3
5974,Nice soap but dissolves quickly ( no it wasn't stored in standing water it's just soft).,3
5975,My great grandfather sold this product door to door to augment his farm income and our family has used it ever since.,5
5976,"This is not THE BODY SHOP gloves, it is a fake!!!!!",1

5978,didn't have any life changing results from this product.,3
5979,smells AWFUL really synthetic 1st time i opened it it made my head hurt ALL DAY. theres NO almond oil only almond fragrance...,1
5980,"I had hoped this fragrance would last longer when used.  I felt it was just ok, and would not reorder for that reason.",3
5981,"Why buy replacement heads for your razor when you can get a completely new razor, that shaves pretty darn good, and is cheap!",5
5982,"brushes shed,they were not as dances as i wanted them to be, over all did its job they were soft .",3
5983,had to have the bangs adjusted but other then that it looks great,3
5984,"Waterpik was recommended to me, and I wanted to try it - this one is just what I had hoped for, with a quick delivery also.",4
5985,The button on my handle is permanently stuck.  So it is broken.  Bummer.  Lasted only 9 months.,2
5986,My husbands balls still smell and are sweaty. BUT the don't get stuck to his thighs anymore.,3
5987,"I love these, yet I didn't get to choose what color I wanted and they took FOREVER to come in.",2
5988,This is a great new formula. I use in conjunction with the Retinol moisturizer at night. Best price around for highly concentrated retinol.,4
5989,"It is too early to tell, but so far seems very good.",4
5990,"I will buy it again, I can give my hair the shape that I want and it will stay like that.",4
5991,Nice overall but it didn't keep my hair from its curly form,3
5992,Does what is supposed to do.  Keeps my razor in good condition. I like the product.  I will order it again when needed.,5
5993,"Shaver Blade Kit
Probably as good as or better than when new.  Really fine.",5
5994,I would recommend this curling iron because it is made with teeth and not bristles. It doesn't get the hair tangled as a result.,5
5995,"With the strength of Retinol in this product, you will notice a difference immediately.  Use sparingly until you can regulate.",4
5996,Would be better if it could dis-assemble but otherwise is great,4
5997,Poor quality. Does not shave close at all.  It was a total waste of money.  I will never buy this brand again.,1
5998,"Definitely moisturizer your face first, but his combined with the Mehron loose powder means your makeup will last through anything. Seriously, anything.",4
5999,Good dryer but not as quiet as I thought it would be.,4
6000,not for me to se i put on it dinot stay on i use clear coat i guess need use glue,3
6001,"All i have to say is that ...
IF i cant workout w/o my Beauty boom cream ...
And it really works .. Just be PATIENT !!!",5
6002,"It was exactly what I was looking for it works great, no tangles",4

6004,Been well over a year and still running great! Holds a charge for weeks!,5
6005,This has a very strong scent and I couldn't use it. Otherwise it worked great on my hair!,2
6006,"Very hard to put in and after I finally got it in, my ear became very swollen and infected",1
6007,Stone falls out. Other then that everything else was great.,2
6008,great cover and saves money--can wait longer to go to the salon!,4
6009,"Pros;

Value for money

6012,"It's very bad product , it will make ur hair very dry very stiff , don't wast your money over it ...!",1
6013,It feels like a toy.  There is not enough difference between the high and low settings.,2
6014,Love all the BMC Nail colors. I have purchased all the sets and love them!,5
6015,I'm not really a fan of this product. The elastic is extremely tight making the cap uncomfortable.,2
6016,not enough air power to dry and style at once for my hair,3
6017,"It held down my edges better than gel would. However, it did not hold for long. It's good for the price.",3
6018,"Sunnies work fine, I don't use the strap because I tan in a lay down bed. Not a bad product. Descent price.",3
6019,It just absorbs the foundation. I stopped using it after 2 tries.,1
6020,"It looks exactly like the picture , you can curl the hair is pretty good",4
6021,"Very classy, my man loves it, but I'm a little annoyed it doesn't hold his rubbery modern multiblade razors smoothly",4
6022,works well- but sounds much noisier than previous one. Sounds like it is will die any day.,4
6023,"The cream is great, The only thing is that every jar is only about two third full.",3
6024,Does what it is supposed to do. No issues.,4
6025,"I am very,very pleased with this product and the results I am seeing. I intend to try other items in this line.",5
6026,I have been looking to try this product and the price was so good that I bought two jars. Hopefully it will be worth it!!,4
6027,Not so comfortable for me in between my toes where the spacer hits my foot.,1
6028,This is overly perfumed and the smell is extremely cloying. I found it too much to stomach.,1
6029,"Very thin and light, but covers the body very well",4
6030,"It broke not even 1 hour into me wearing it. I was very disappointed, seeing how I waited a month to get it.",1
6031,I gave this shaver away after several tries. It didn't shave nearly as close as my Panasonic which I ordered subsiquently.....,1
6032,Works very well. Love all the attachments that are included. Received on the date promised.,5
6033,"I really like their products I buy several of them, good stuff.

D. Thomas",4

6035,This stuff is amazing. Keeps my eczema away! Thank you!,5
6036,A little bit more pink that I was looking for but the product is good. Good pigment and it lasts all day.,4
6037,"Total junk, I'd give it no stars if I could. The company was good enough to issue a prompt refund though.",1
6038,Threw it in the trash as soon as their is moisture starts to crumble,1
6039,My friend like it and it looks nice on her and it's cheaper than other places .,3
6040,"Just what's needed for a safety razor. Easy to use and gives a nice smooth shave. Good price, good value.",5
6041,Get your teeth really white but a little uncomfortable since they are a little to small.,3
6042,Hairline was well protected but center was still wet. I would stick to the headbands. Those are great,4
6043,Total waste of money!  I can't imagine there is anyway to use this stuff and not get it in your eyeballs.  Painful!,1
6044,"Comparable to what's put on me at the salon, good enough for our needs.",4
6045,Gave it to my friend at Christmas and she loved it!,5
6046,Holds everything perfect and the base is havy to stand up well.,5
6047,"Do not waste your $$$!
this unit is the cheapest & lowest quality electric shaver available from a brand name!
Awe full exprience.",1

6050,They are not comfortable.  After about 10 min i have to take them off,3
6051,I love these because they're so fluffy and adorable but they aren't as pointed as I expected. Overall they're great c:,4
6052,"The Dr. Adorable product are great, pure and cold press. I just wish their bottles were better, if it falls it could break very easily",4
6053,It works but you will have to buy a new one every two weeks. Cheaper then a spa or injections.,3

6055,"My daughter loves them.

She used them for prom and her make up came out great.  The are soft and easy to clean.",4

6057,Arrived spilled everywhere. With a strong smell of alcohol and a hole seeping through the box.,1
6058,I didn't like this at all. They must have changed their formula. It's almost pasty. Doesn't absorb at all. :(,2
6059,Smell doesn't stay and not sure if it attracts. Smells clean.,4
6060,Bought 2 of these one for our son and the other for my husband and I. Our son had braces and it was great with all the attatchments,5
6061,It's aquaphor people lol it works great on my son's dry face and the diaper area,5
6062,"the product have all broke, the holding schroef has lost",1
6063,"This product works much better in conjunction with the night cream.  On it's own, it not that good.",3
6064,can't prove it's effective so I don't know,4
6065,its work to keep clean and to use it enough to warrant price,4
6066,I expected a razor for the bikini area to be close but gentle.  This razor pinches!  I would not buy it again.,2
6067,Love it! Makes my face feel very fresh but can be a little harsh if my skin is dry,4
6068,"I found the All-in-1 Grooming System to be a pretty good shaver, but the nice thing is all of the attachment and options.",4
6069,"Works fast, Surprising quite, Would be easier to use with a 12"" longer cord. For the price, it's a very good buy.",4
6070,So sad this is so hard to find. My favorite makeup,5
6071,"Excellent package, excellent quality of brushes, very cute to the eye",5
6072,"I don't think it blends well, very thick.  Color don't match, don't care for it",1
6073,It just smells like it would be good for me!,4
6074,"fast shipping, cheap, works. only problem is its corded, but its in the description and it is why it is cheap.",4
6075,They are super flexible and that just not what i wanted or what i expected.,2
6076,pulls on wiskers....only had a 30 day return policy and i ordered two just finding out about one..will not use third party anymore i lost 33 bucks,1
6077,"I guess it works ok,  my dentist has noticed some improvement in gum condition",3
6078,"This product works as well as any shaver I have had.

NOTE: the head can fall off easily when open for cleaning.",4
6079,Purchased for an on-the-go option for my school-age child with braces; it's difficult for him to use w/o assistance.,3
6080,My favorite scent for personal care but out is not sold in retail stores anymore. Would order in bulk but cannot justify the marked up price.,4
6081,I have only just started using this product and am sold. I will most definitely repeat. It is unbelievably well priced.,4
6082,Don't even want to manscape with these clippers vibrate excessively...,1
6083,A little goes a long way. I prefer for my skin then hair,5
6084,"This shaver does what it advertises. It gives a good, close shave. I have no regrets buying this product.",4
6085,I find this soap somewhat disappointing. The scent is almost nonexistent and it is not as dream as I expected.,3
6086,"I feel safer,,but the fingers could have been longer .",4
6087,"Terrible color, looked pinky on picture but muddy beige color",1
6088,Water shoots everywhere and makes a mess. Not satisfied with this product. Thank you very much! Writing all of these words is ridiculous.,2
6089,Peals off easily. Don't last long. I won't buy this again.,1
6090,"Broke after 2 uses... wouldn't turn on, tried changing the batteries, still wouldn't work!",1
6091,"An excellent portable razor. Unfortunately, new blades cost as much as a new razor.",5
6092,The different smells were wonderful. I don't have a favorite because they're all fabulous. Thanks,4
6093,Doesn't work as well as we hoped. Had better support folding a microfiber pillow in half.,1
6094,Smells like a dream. Did seem to lighten some areas up. It just didn't quite produce the effects I was seeking personally.,3
6095,Loved the ones I got. Except I got duplicates of 4 of them.,3
6096,"Blades are quality, and give a very close shave.",4
6097,My wife and I both wear these and we both sleep much better. Occasionally they have to be adjusted in the night but they work quite well.,4
6098,What else can I say? This thing is just too small to place my package in! They need to make em in different sizes!!!,2
6099,"I can not recommend this shaver highly, it works ok, nothing great.  I wish there were better head shavers available.",3
6100,"Nothing beats this... Great stoof, great price... nothing more you can ask for.",5
6101,"Unfortunately it gets extremely hot after running for only a few minutes, to the point of it burning your scalp.",1
6102,"It looks like the batteries don't live as long as it is announced in manual ...

All other specs looks like OK !!!",4
6103,When u got them they only lasted like 2 weeks the main top brush fell off it was disappointing,1
6104,I have been using this product for about two weeks with excellant results. Also it is very well designed.,4
6105,no quede satisfecha con el producto ya q me llego destrozado el compacto... creo q no fue embalada bien...q lastima...por eso lo califique bajo..,1
6106,Soft material but too small. Have to constantly readjust.,2
6107,"This stuff is creamy and thick and works so incredibly well, but the scent makes me hesitant to use it every time.",4
6108,Works well but is very loud so if you have roommates or close neighbors keep that in mind,4
6109,They did not last. I got this specifically to practice and it did not work.,2
6110,"Smells strong, stings skin. Dislike. Was hoping for soothing rose water.",2
6111,Great coverage.  Not sticky or stiff.  Stays on over night.  Great product!,4
6112,I am delighted with this Waterpik. I does everything I need.,5
6113,Haven't used yet as I'm still using the patchouli but I can smell and is awesome. Ordered 3 scents from same seller. Like them all,5
6114,"They work but, oddly, an extra spot for a 6th toe?",3
6115,Product description is a 4-pack. My order only container 1 jar!,1
6116,This product came without a safety seal and looked liked someone had messed with it.,1
6117,Great curling iron for my short hair. Adds body and texture to my very fine thin hair. Definitely recommend.,5
6118,Best razor I have ever owned!!!!!,5
6119,good system much quieter than previous versions wish water container was a little larger water pik has kept me from needing dental surgery now for 7 years,4
6120,"This Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser, works very well, I like it. I use it every day to clean my teeth.",4
6121,Acceptable. Not great but fine if you need a pair to try or replace.,3
6122,Great shaver. 4 stars only because it is a bit noisy. Holds a charge for a several shaves. I would highly recommend this product.,2
6123,"This is great for oily skin, a great  prima.  Would definitely recommend",5
6124,"To smell it keeps come out from my nose, wasted money again for this s***.",1
6125,Works well. Nothing out of this world but gets the job done painlessly,3
6126,I like that the product is natural and that oz doesn't test on animals but I didn't see a huge difference in anti-aging.,3
6127,Just the thing we needed for our 8 year old!,4
6128,"It is messy.  Dental floss is much less expensive and works
much better.

I would not recommend this product to anyone.",2
6129,It fit ok but it still comes up in the back like every other stocking cap I bought,4
6130,It was great in the beginning-- very gentle.  1 year into using it it stopped working.  Maybe they only last a year?,3
6131,Contains lead. Tried to cancel order after found out but too late to cancel.,1
6132,When i got this item it was abolutely huge and too long. Looks nothing like the picture and i'm disapointed,1

6139,making my skin dry and fucjing the oil . Ud better not use it day by day,4
6140,"No matter if we follow the ""opening instructions"" we generally end up with a tangled box of floss.  BUT they work well.",3
6141,"No tangling as others reported, but still takes a long time to dry.",3
6142,Expensive for the results.  You're paying for the Aveda name.,3
6143,"nice for nite time, needed a thicker cream and feels nice",4
6144,"It is a beautiful tiara. However, one gem fell off the first time I wore it. otherwise, it is stunning.",4
6145,"Worked fine, then the stupid shaver quit and had to by a new one",4
6146,Bleeds when you try to clean it. Makeup never really comes out.,3
6147,My product was not sealed and either used or something.. attached are pictures. Would like a refund please.,1
6148,Very good product for fine/thin hair.  Does help with texture and thickness.,4

6151,"So watered down, I didn't feel like it was actually shampoo. I tried twice then threw it away.",1
6152,All of these fell out of my nose when I was sleeping. They were cute while they lasted,2
6153,Love them but there nor very noticeable once there in your boss there tiny.,4
6154,Just ok. Not super sharp but will get you through the day.,3
6155,Pleased with this pumice stone. Tucked one inside a Christmas stocking for a friend. Like the attached rope hanger,5
6156,"Works well and holds my shaver and brush. Nice chrome finish, the wife allows me to leave out on the counter.",4
6157,"My favorite lipstick right now, especially for the price. Perfect neutral. I like to wear it with my baby lips peach kiss balm.",5
6158,"If you have a lot of hair, this is not the product for you. It is very soft though.",3
6159,Flimsy half of them were bent.. can't use them they are maybe a 22 gauge if you are lucky.. they went right threw my piercing hole..,2
6160,It is very convenient for traveling--removes the foundation easily !,4
6161,"Basically, what this is ia powder that is immersed in a solution the consistency of handcream. It actually does work.",4
6162,"This is the thrid Waterpik that I have had.  They do a great job getting stuff out of your teeth, even after brushing.",5
6163,"Shears are very sharp. Would love them if they were 6.5""",4
6164,Bought by my aunt thru me and did good on her use thanks,4
6165,I am bead head products fan but this one does not really work on my hair. It does not actually give any boost to my hair.,1
6166,"Nice color, but it tastes sweet. I wonder if there is sugar in it.",3
6167,My product was not sealed and either used or something.. attached are pictures. Would like a refund please.,1
6168,not for human nose. more for a barbie dolls nose,1
6169,this stand is well made and is weighted so as not to tip over.,5
6170,Easy to use. Has paid for itself in 2 uses.,4
6171,Came in a timely manner and works perfectly.  It was much cheaper than other places that  l checked,4
6172,Cheap ass. They break very easily.  I donated them after using one set.,2
6173,"Great product, works the way it is supposed to.",5
6174,Gengigel works well. It gives my mouth a cool sensation and stays in place allowing the gums to heal.,4
6175,"This is a really great frother.  It frothes wonderfully and does not splash, like most frothers.  I highly recommend it.",5
6176,Perfect for my boys down below.  Feel drier and more confident through the day.,5
6177,Good but do not use. Other dental devices more convenient.,4
6178,Worn it a few times and the seams are unraveling.  Bad product and waste of time and effort having to return it.,1
6179,Blade is not as described!!! Money wasted.,1
6180,"I've never been a huge fan of flossing, but this machine gets the job done and makes the process a whole lot less painful and messy.",4
6181,It's a very soft scrub - you can barely feel the beads. Otherwise nice.,4
6182,"Theses goggles protect my eyes well from Sirius SS-77 Aurora Light Therapy System, but cut into the area around my eyes a bit.",4
6183,"Only need a small amount and it rubs in and dries quickly, very fragrant and may be too much for some.",4
6184,Clumsy at best. Very difficult to work with. More trouble than it's to return it.,1
6185,"the product doesn't bond hair for very long. i used it to bond my hair extensions and it simply fell apart. Won't order again,",2
6186,"quick delivery, item as described, good condition, no problems",5
6187,The case it comes in isn't the greatest but there  are good rhinestones for sure,3
6188,"It didn't, do as advertised.  I will give it another try.  Reviews were great, but in my case, it didn't work",2
6189,"Every time I use it, I hope i can get a close shave before the charge runs out.  For a $100 shaver it stinks.",1
6190,much larger than I expected.  not sure i will keep,3
6191,I feel this one I bought recently is slow compare to the one I had before.,3
6192,Works well. Only gripe is it is not washble.,4
6193,"I wouldnhave liked to choose the color, I got a black dots and a pink canvas! but still cute. A little pricey  only for one headband",3
6194,"It does set the gel, however. It puts bubbles in the gel and you have to file them down. So not really impressed!!!",4
6195,Ok product but a ridiculous price.  There are lots of great products out there that can help your hair at a much better price.,4
6196,"They're very thin -- fine for the children's activity I planned them for, but they're not 'guest towel' quality!",4
6197,Will absolutely purchase this again; works with tangles and decreasing static electricity in hair.,5
6198,"it was ok, but it could have been just a little bigger",4
6199,It is great.  Like that it takes up less room on the bathroom counter.,5
6200,Very nice packaging with free Japanese snack from her child  thank you so much!,5
6201,"a good shave at a reansonable price

  corded i wouldnt buy it if it wasn't corded

however its too short  needs a longer cord",3
6202,I will buy more.  I really notice a difference in my skin...,5
6203,"Too big and heavy as a travel dryer, which is why I got it. At home, I'm sure it would be just fine.",3
6204,I couldn't believe how ugly this piece of jewelry was plus it had sharp edges on it.,1
6205,Great environmentally safe hair conditioner. I've used it before and am pleased with the way my hair feels afterwards.,5
6206,Very good. Use it and happy. Recommend seller.,5
6207,Good shine product that's not to heavy. Just need a little bit. It can dry your hair after left on long.,4
6208,I use this product for my hair and it not only smells really good but it leaves my hair moisterized. I love it!,4
6209,Ordered a six pack of original 50 meter rolls and received six 40 meter rolls of flavored floss...,1
6210,"This is great shaver at a very good price. Pros - very close shave without irratation, can leave plugged in. Cons - loud.",4
6211,my boy is 42 and I gave it to him for Christmas.  He thought it was funny!,3
6212,"These earrings are pretty. Was hoping for short posts, otherwise would've Givin 5*",4

I recommend this stuff to every guy out there",4
6214,The shave is smooth when compared to other razors and blades.,4
6215,"fast shipping but smaller tahn I thought, still will use and helps fill up empty space in my BIG purse and holds lots of items",4
6216,This works great and I keep one on all levels of my house!,4
6217,This has really helped me retain my edges and not lose hair during glue removal.,3
6218,"Beautiful colour! I lov ethat korean lip colours fit every possible skin tone, they have ao many colours and the texture of this is lovely",5
6219,My mouth has never felt so clean.  After brushing & flossing the waterpik removes so much that I never realized ewmained between my teeth.,5
6220,"Holds really well but does shine, looks like plastic. Looking for another bonding tape that doesn't shine. I would buy again for the hold.",3
6221,Doesn't work very well. I have fine over processed hair and it really didn't do anything but make it look frizzy.,2
6222,"I like the feel, smell amd results of this cream",5
6223,The lid was broken when I received the package and the product was pouring out.,2
6224,Very well made. I didn't like only a button holds it together; but I really like the way it looks.,4
6225,Dental floss should neither shred nor break.  This product does not shred but it snaps apart far too easily.,2
6226,It's the recommendation of my urologist and I'm very satisfied. That's why I'am going to buy the two boxes in few days.,4
6227,very nice quality.very fast shipping. I was very leery due to the price of the item. But very pleasantly surprised how nice it was.,4
6228,"I like the smaller brush, but find the dryer quite heavy and bulky.",3
6229,"love how it doesn't tear in my mouth or get caught between my teeth.  I guess it works well, dentist hasn't found a problem.",5
6230,"great product wish it was a little bigger, buy the alum block.",4
6231,It met all of my expectations. Most of the dark spots are gone after three weeks. I will continue to use it.,5
6232,Would not lock around my thick hair.  Way too expensive for how cheaply they are made.,2
6233,"This can't be legal. We are all in the same tasteless, disgusting boat. Isn't this how class action lawsuits begin?",1
6234,This product takes 6 months to see results but so far very easy to use. I have used only 1 month now.,4
6235,just what I was looking for. What a great purchase.,4
6236,Tapes arrived but didn't know to order strings to hold them in place. Very disappointed,2
6237,Didn't really like these to much I feel they don't have enough bristles but they work alright I use them as a back up,3
6238,Maggies are my favorite socks. I have many pairs and styles,5
6239,100 Razors to last you for quite some time.  What else is there to say?  Great price and a great product.,4
6240,It works as I remembered.  I used to have one as a child.  My teeth feel cleaner after use.,4
6241,"Got this lovely product in two days -- and free shipping!! The product goes on so smoothly.  Looking forward to thicker, longer lashes!",5
6242,I needed something to keep al my items from falling to the bottom of my purse and this works great.,4
6243,Didn't work as expected.  Nice concept but didn't brighten my hair at all.  No added value.,1
6244,This came broken.  Had to throw away.  Wasn't worth sending back.,1
6245,I haven't used the product as of yet.  You ask for too many words on a product bought for future use!!,5
6246,"Not as abrasive as you may think... Does the job, and it doesn't over dry out my skin which I am sensitive to...",5
6247,"Excellent product, perfect to use in the tanning beds.  easy to use too!  I highly recommend these to anyone using standing tanning beds.",5
6248,The post snapped right off after opening package. Cost too much to return when the earring were cheap in the first place.,1
6249,"This is the standard toothbrush my dentist (and many others) recommend. Compact head, soft bristles. The price is just right.",4
6250,Ordered this iron less than a month ago and it has stopped heating up.,1
6251,Find it very noisy and awkward to use. It does do the job of getting all that food out of crevices.,3
6252,Items not pre-attached with adhesive. I'm not sure if the lashes are human hair or not because all the wording was chinese,2
6253,"It does shave well in the private places, however one had to be really careful not to nick the skin.",3
6254,I haven't seen any difference in the 3 weeks I have been using the product,1
6255,The mask was perfect.  I just got the wrong size.,4
6256,I bought these shortly after starting to use a safety razor. These are by far the best razors yet. I will be purchasing them again.,5
6257,this worked well with daily use for 8 years until the tubing split. The tips were replaced once,4
6258,"Easy to use, easy to clean, and cuts almost as close as my manual razor.  Not much else to say.",5
6259,Does what it is labeled. Keeps everything in place.,4
6260,It looks just like the picture. Size was good. Quality is good for the price.,4
6261,"Unable to use this bottle at all. when opened, the glue was solid and hard. Will buy this product elsewhere from now on.",1
6262,"This shaver gives me a great, smooth shave, with no nicks or cuts like my razor blade did used to.",5
6263,This is my second one of these.  First one lasted a long time (5 yrs?).  It's my favorite shaver of this type.,5
6264,"Dentist recommended using it and I like it. Leaves a clean, fresh feeling. Gets areas that flossing may miss. Use every time I brush.",4
6265,I was sceptical about this product and was pleasantly surprised when it worked exactly as it was supposed to!,5
6266,These were basically useless as they did not come with an elastic band as advertised.,1
6267,Amazing product. Good seller. I've very impressed with the quality of this product and would buy from them again.,5
6268,"Cheapest diffuser I found. Sometimes it doesn't seem like much vapor is coming out, but for the price its not bad.",3
6269,"These are more flexible than the ones I used to get from my dentist.  Less flex would be better, IMO.",3
6270,Great item! I wish I would have purchased it a long time ago.,4
6271,I received a damaged didn't feel like returning it. I had to taste the end up.  Better to sew it,1
6272,They took forever to get here because of getting overseas but I do like them a lot.,4
6273,"These are life savers and really last for three hours.  They also help with cravings, too.  Always have them on hand!",5
6274,i have been on the phone 3 times with waterpik to figure out why it has no pressure and keep getting the run around,2
6275,Very cute. Goes well with button-up shirts as statement piece.,4
6276,Its way too small for a 3 yrs old!!!,1
6277,Received the folding comb twice when attempting to order this comb. Inventory is not correct for this item.,1
6278,seller was awesome these are a great product will be buying more of them :),5
6279,Seems nice. Dont spray too much or you will burn your eyes.,4
6280,COST OF THIS IS CONTINUNING TO RISE HAS MORE THAN DOUBLED IN LAST YEAR OR SO. A GOOD ITEM FOR ME JUST HARD TO BUY.,3
6281,Helps keep the razor head clean and functioning. Wish they would last a little bit longer for the price but...,4
6282,"Very effective to floss. The adjustable power helps to adjust the pressure in sensitive areas.
Have a fresh feeling after I use it.",4
6283,these shed so much! i only got a few uses out of them.,2
6284,I think the product is working better for me than lanolin was but I don't think my son cares for the taste too much.,3
6285,Smells great. Not generally a fan of milky cleansers generally. Didn't notice any difference.,3
6286,Has a weird plastic smell mingled with the rose scent. I'm reluctant to use it on my face.,2
6287,the paperport 14.0 is very good ( I like)  the scotch hair tape my wife like very much.,4
6288,The lens is TOO STRONG..basically a magnifying lens. Takes some getting used to.,3
6289,"Just a tad small for my abundant hair, but I love them.",4
6290,Great fun product.  Looking forward to the next dress up party. Going as the tattooed lady.,4
6291,I have short hair and this product was not a good choice for me.  I thought it was more of a wrap than a ponytail holder.,2
6292,"I love the color but I found the same brand and color at Walmart for 1.93, this was a RIP OFF!!!",2
6293,I like it. However the color can not last long. It will wash away after a few wash. I will buy it again.,4
6294,These disposable strips are hard to apply and do not stay on your teeth. To the trash can. Not worth my time.,1
6295,Does the job - my dentist recommended I use one but it is a pain and gets water all over.,3
6296,Works better than Remington MSC-140 Men's Titanium Battery Operated Foil Travel Shaver that I also bought. Lack of third head makes it a slow job though.,4
6297,It does the job when you don't have time to apply color to the whole head.,4
6298,I use KeraFiber but after shower it's gone. for this cost we can't maintain for daily basis,2
6299,"I have DD's just for future reference, this does not work....not even a little.",1
6300,I didn't want to leave any stars but it wouldnt allow me. I received an empty package.,1
6301,I have several brushes for detangling hair. This has become my favorite daily brush as it seems to detangle my fine hair better than the others.,5
6302,"Its good, but after 3 to  4 uses, it is not that great. Think blades should be changed pretty often.",4
6303,Received without delay. I'm looking forward to a great shaving experience,4
6304,Holds really nice for shorter hair as well as longer hair without getting all crusty like hair gels do. Only need a small amount.,4
6305,"It's a bit noisy, other than that, it's a good product, I am using it everyday and it became my daily routine now",4
6306,Purchase for my tween and I do not know if he is actually using it.  I can confirm it has no odor.,3
6307,"This helps me for short periods.  After that, the separator begins to pain me.",4
6308,"Haven't had them long, but so far so good. There's little sparkles in the black handle part.",4
6309,I have wanted one of these for years. It really does a nice job of cleaning between the teeth etc.,5
6310,"Meh. I like the natural wood bowl better in terms of appearance, but this'll do.",4
6311,My only problem was the brush but I made it work.,4
6312,"I guess, my dark spots do not respond to the product or I just simply do not have the patience to do it properly.",3
6313,Completely broken when I received this! I'm so upset paying money for something that I can't use! Will be returning.,1
6314,The wax that came with it is HORRIBLE.  So I just went out and got the honey kind.  Other than that I like it.,3
6315,Very good but you have to use for at least a week everyday before you start really seeing them no more.,3
6316,Love this cuticle oil it smells and works great! It made my cuticles super soft and the surrounding skin really fragrant.,4
6317,I'm hoping this cream moisturizers my skin.  It makes my skin feel tight.  Uncomfortable,1
6318,I have been using the organic muslin cloths for a month now and it really helps to get every bit of makeup off my face.,5
6319,I love it  because the metal is thin I love the Christies they are beautiful  it fits good around my head,5
6320,"cute and love the color but was so stiff i couldn't wear the bracelet
would have been better if it wasn't so stiff",3
6321,I have been using Aqua Velva for over 30 years. This is  a knock off. Smells rotton,1
6322,I was disappointed that this more expensive roller brush only kasted a few months.,3
6323,Holds my EJ razor just fine but not wide enough for my shave brush. Very frustrating.,1
6324,The brushes are a little hard.. And they are almost the same,3
6325,"Ok m now this is sweet ! Looks legit, heavy. Now I need 10 more xmen dogtags !!",5
6326,"Definitely very tacky. Rolls on easy, but any amount of sweat, where applied, removes all its functionality.",4
6327,It's not as luxurious as it looked in the picture but I still like it. And you can't beat the price!,3
6328,Very disappointing product. It is impossible to clean with baby shampoo or other cleansers. Wish I had saved my money.,1
6329,"very easy to use , ver effiicient way to clean you tooth, i am very satisfied with my purchase, and the price was very affordable",4
6330,"not much to say about these, they are pretty standard fake baking protection glasses, and they worked out just fine.",4
6331,"Not at all what advertised. I have dry skin, and i need large amounts of this cream. Furthermore, no effect on wrinkles. Very disappointing",2
6332,"This was a fine purchase, if my intention was to only use it twice before the motor burned out and it stopped working.",1
6333,"Not quite as comfortable as the first one I sent for, but still makes foot more comfortable.",4
6334,"Works really well... When it stays on. I am an admittedly wild sleeper, but still disappointing that it comes off multiple times throughout the night.",3
6335,"GF likes it, but gel grip sometimes gets caught in strands of hair and pulls. Got the blue one.",4
6336,"It's cheap, it's on a short chain. There should be two dog tags, not one. Very poor product.",1
6337,"Mini Foil Shaver. Does not work,Where to buy new,",1
6338,easy to use -can adjust pressure like the storage area that is located in the top lid that holds the extra use tips,4
6339,Great product!  Clean&fresh smell.  It is one of my bath and shower products.  I do love many of the Boots products.,5
6340,it does not work!!! can't clean sponge !! worse,1
6341,"Gave it 4 stars due to the accurate description and prompt service. Trying it tonight, we'll see what happens.",4
6342,This left a white pasty film on my skin and looked as if I was wearing heavy makeup on my face.,2
6343,"Break  3- 4 times during flossing,  Every time breaks,I had to use new one  the old product was  much better. Very disappointed",1
6344,Didn't work as well as I thought. It might be that it takes some getting used to with the adjustment from the non natural,1
6345,These razors are garbage. Dull right out of the box. Hurts my face to use them. Do not buy them.,1
6346,"The wig is great, good quality, the front part is a little tricky to style, but it's a very good product overall!",4
6347,"This does shave very close.  But you have to make several passes in different directions to get the close shave, otherwise it actually skips whiskers.",4
6348,I have bleach blonde hair and it hardly showed up!,1
6349,I like this thing and the pressure seems pretty good. My only complaint is that the picks break easily if dropped.,4
6350,Looks nice! Goes well with my Baxter of California Razor and Badger Hair Brush!,4
6351,"Good blade, cuts well.  Can't beat the price.",4
6352,I ordered the bar shampoo for my son and husband as their scalp itches alot.  My husband said his scalp felt really good.,5
6353,Great tool for the price. On the downside it takes too long to charge and the cord connection stopped working properly after a while.,4
6354,Clumpy and gross. I don't know who could possibly wear this,1
6355,Really sad they changed the brush on these.  It makes it so hard to put on mascara.  Used to be my fave...,1
6356,Product worked for a month. I cleaned it as directed and it began to put out steam again for one day.,1
6357,"Works much better than others I've used. Clean, accurate trimming and guard is designed well.",5
6358,I love this my skin feels so soft after I just wish it was more milky. But the bubbles are great and last extremely long!,4
6359,Does not work for my baby. Still got the rush.,1
6360,Gets the job done but is too bulky for my liking,2
6361,Great item! I wish I would have purchased it a long time ago.,4
6362,The pills smell when you open the container and they leave an after taste.,1
6363,Don't waste your time with this product.  Go get pasties instead.,1
6364,The blades work fine  Its just absolutely incredible how expensive replacement blades are! In two years the blades cost as much as the electric razor does.,3
6365,I'm not the best with estimating size so I expected a larger piece. Looks nice though.,4
6366,bought for a friend.  She says they aren't useful.  Cheaply made.,2
6367,"It works pretty good, but tends to pull your skin a lot which is super painful.",3

6372,Filters don't fit a REMstar Pro. Way too big.,1
6373,Great hair product. Good for formal occasions or for general hair styling.,5
6374,"this arrived quickly and smells super good if you like the scent of roses, which I do. The bottle is really big too.",5
6375,"Color assortment is crap. Out of 20, 8 are yellow.  Ick.",1
6376,"Not what I expected, too small for what I wanted.",2
6377,The on-off switch broke immediately. I like the way it diffuses but have to fiddle with it to get it to run.,2
6378,"Flimsy and tablets don't stay on. Also, very thin and clumsy.",1
6379,This product has alcohol in it which irritates sensitive skin. Had I known the ingredients I would not have bought it.,1
6380,Used once and trashed afterwards.  The entire link was made of cheap material and resulted in the entire product rusting after first use.,1
6381,The powder keeps my upper thighs from chafing; the breast cream turns to nice powder after application.,4
6382,"I think this is a knock off, don't purchase left my face so oily and cakey",1
6383,Great. But it rusted when I left it on the sill of my window next to the shower. No longer usable :(,4

6388,"they are soooooooooooooooo tiny like , you have to be careful because u can loose all of them in seconds....",3

6390,It was so sticky that I couldn't even keep it on for a minute.,2
6391,This is my 2nd sonicare. For some reason my son's other one stop charging so we bought this to replace it. Love sonicare products.,5
6392,I like this stool. It is very lite and rolls easily. Very easy to put together. I would buy another one.,4
6393,Did not fit my key.  Also cannot use key ring with this device,2
6394,"It didn't stay sharp too long, but I guess that's he  nature of them.",2
6395,Every single one I used ended up broken.  I think it's because it's too short and not deep enough.,2
6396,"The cost of a double-edged safety razor is no more than $.11. It will provide a clean, close shave. as well.",5
6397,Haven't got this yet?love this and will be gald when it gets here it's taking long time have a nice day,1
6398,"I recommend it, It leaves my hair smooth and the price is very affordable, my father told me about it.",5

6400,"Works great but when I hit the pause button the button sticks in the pause position

Difficult to get it going again,,,,",4
6401,"Chain too long, and won't hold the cardigans together like it should",2
6402,"Works very well, no complaints other than it's bit overpriced",4
6403,This product was exactly what it stated and not a cheap knock off. Was the exact nose cup of my original mask at an affordable price.,5
6404,Don't try to change to this before a big event,3
6405,It moisturizes okay but it leaves this weird residue behind that can clump up in my hands when I rub it in.,3
6406,"Really wanted to like it, but it left a strong scent.  It also was very drying.",2
6407,"Great stuff!! Stays hard, stays payable. The only thing is it doesn't wash out easily.",4
6408,I wish it smelled better but other than that it was a good purchase I would use this product again,4
6409,Worked but I found it to be greasy. Have to use alot to get the same effect as ponds.,3
6410,Our daughter uses these almost daily for her many dance classes. It makes it very easy to create a bun that holds nicely for hours.,5
6411,There's a lot of fall out and make my lashes unpleasantly clumpy,2
6412,Delivered on time.  This is a wonderful product to use on baby and dry hands.,5

6420,The small / medium might fit my 10 year old grand daughter but not for 10yr old. Size runs way small.,1
6421,Was expecting more. To much shiner. Brushes were great. But make up wasn't what I was looking for,1
6422,Puchased this because the website stated rhat it was good for oily skin but it didn't help and it made my skin feel sticky.,2
6423,A little painful if you wear them too long but they're okay,3
6424,Great for me and my daughter who are big tattoo enthusiasts! Perfect healing item and costs is great.,4
6425,I did not like it. It doesn't get hot enough to straighten out my hair. Sorry,1

6427,"Amazing! Do I need to say more? If so, hubby and I both love this product.",5
6428,"My B-12 blood test was off the chart!!  Easily dissolved under the tongue, pleasant taste.",5
6429,"Within the first month, we had to stop using this product. There was not enough pumping action to get the alcohol up to the top.",1
6430,It could use more of a diffused nozzle so one doesn't have to rub it in with hands.,3
6431,"Was great when it worked.  Quit working.  Won't pump. No leaks, just won't pump.",1
6432,Not that happy with the quality of the brissels. I would not order again online.,3

6448,"I love this thing. Not bad for a womans shape up, if you know what I mean. Easy to use.",5

6450,I was unable to use it.  It remained a mass of tangles after several days of use.  It is a waste of money.,1
6451,"It's good,  easy to handle, but it became hot every easy and disconnect you have to wait until it cool again to operate.",3
6452,"This item was good, but I wish it had more flowers like the coral color one. The double flowers look very cheap.",3
6453,Inferior to the older model with square water holder. Why was it abandoned? It should be brought back. The redesign is not better.,4
6454,works well is just what i expected am very pleased with this product and great service. would recommend this item.,4

6460,It never really fully dries so it's a bit sticky but other than that it's a beautiful color and it's definitely a new favorite of mine,4
6461,Smelled kinda chemically. But I took a soft soap I had and hand molded it into the bowl. Works great!,4
6462,Excellent tool when there are too many lesions to biopsy or the lesion/s are too small to visualize effectively. Highly recommend.,5

6476,"This is nice, but the cloth s cheap. I wouldn't buy it again.",3
6477,"Works fine but I wouldn't use it for the bikini line and further, makes the skin very tender. Hard wax was better for that.",4
6478,It's hard to sleep on side with the pad .Wont buy it again,3
6479,Product seems to be ok.  Takes time to see if results are as predicted.,3
6480,Previously purchased the same one.  The holder that is on the wall won't hold the larger toilet paper rolls.  So this is just perfect.,5
6481,I added peppermint oil to make it more of a pain relief rub,3
6482,Great blades work awesome as long as the handle I had didn't break :( . They shave close & no burning.,4

6491,"this item works okay - left my hands softer, but it is a little pricy for what it does.",4
6492,"Its good for what we pay. Though, the short trim selection isn't as good as its supposed to be. Worth the price.",3
6493,Good price. Solid construction. Should have warning on box about having the screw loose ahead of opening box. Great bathroom accessory.,4

6508,Got this for my student teacher. She loves it and uses it everyday.,4
6509,I GAVE IT A FOUR BECAUSE BECAUSE ALTHOUGH IT IS GOOD I FIND IT LOSES ITS GRIP AFTER A FEW HOURS...,4

6539,Came expired. Definitely listen to the reviews. Lame and waste of money,1
6540,I like this deodorant but I stopped ordering it because it always seems to break into small chunks.,3
6541,Pretty good stuff. Make sure you watch a video if you are new to mineral makeup. Application is tricky and a little goes a local way.,4
6542,Item is nice but contains very little product and for the price I could of purchased a full sice one........,3
6543,Insert tabs broke on most of the bins.  Hooks don't stay in pegboard like the ones with 3 hook set-up,2

6590,My daughter loves it and she has really short hair so she uses it to curl her top.,5
6591,Keeps my Norelco shaver clean. One problem is that it can evaporate quickly it you don't use it often.,4
6592,Very nice product.  Makes a very nice base for applying color.,4
6593,"I am a nail biter, unless, I use this wonderful product! Thank you for the great service.",5

6596,"My girlfriend said she got the ""Crimson Clam"" shade and after a week she said her fingers smelled like catfood. Does this contain animal fat?",1
6597,now i realize that it says nose rings... these things are tiny.. hey at least now i have balls for my 16 gauge lip rings,4

But the product is great.  Nice Variety of color.",4

6613,I ordered this one time. It came and wouldnt heat up. I exchanged it for a new one and it STILL doesnt work!!,1

6616,"I used the 3x before, but the 3x has gone up extremely a lot. so I am using the 2x. it seems to be alright",4
6617,Seems like an effective way to floss. My ultimate satisfaction will be determined at my next dentist appointment.,4

6626,Product came perfectly packaged. It does work perfect. Come with different brushes so my husband with braces can use its own. I love it!,5
6627,My husband uses a Norelco electric razor and he says this is perfect for cleaning it. Brochure claims proper cleaning will lengthen life of razor.,5

6635,Very good product. I bought it for my dry skin and haven't had a problem ever since I got it. Love it,5

6663,"Kinda smelly, but i love putting this after i shave my face and at nights.",4
6664,Great for the price you pay!! And like me i tend to lose them :),5

6666,the 1050- 1060- 1090 same razor shave  the same the only difference is the read out on how many shaves you have left.these razor shave very close.,5
6667,"Not as powerful as my older twenty five year model.
Does not perform to level of my older waterpik, but does an OK job.",4
6668,The tip of this broke off within a few weeks.  Before that it would come loose and swivel around out of control....wouldn't recommend.,1
6669,So I tried it...now I know I would never do it again!,1
6670,Was very pleased with this product. I have used it before hence the reason for purchasing.,4

6679,I have been using for a long time and still no results on my edges,3
6680,"The pump arrived broken because of packing it separately wrapped tightly around the bottle of hand scrub, broke the straw part. The product is great otherwise",3
6681,Not a good product. It was a waste of money one was it was gone.,1
6682,"Feels badly designed.
Button to stop water outlet is wrong, should be button to eject jet of water.
Faulty after 4 months.",1
6683,Good. It would work on simple tooth aches. But not major ones.,3
6684,The scarf in the picture is a lot larger then what I received. It is pretty but very small.,1

6691,"This eyelash serum is the best on Amazon. It really works - I see results and I am very happy! Definitely worths money, hands down!",5
6692,Opens up to easily which makes it hard to wear. Better as a decoration.,3
6693,"I get 4-5 shaves with each razor, after that it causes pimples. I find it too expensive, but there is no better alternative.",4
6694,"I have pixie cut and this is PERFECT.  Strong hold that looks natural - not hard, lets wind hit it & still remains moldable/textured",5
6695,Didn't see any difference - I suffer from blackheads and whiteheads and this cleared neither.,2
6696,"Not that great, really cheap looking and feeling. It's just black ribbon tied against a cat ear shape.",2

6705,"Did not like the products at all. Greasy, strong smells . Was not what I expected at all. I would not recommend this product.",1

6709,Very cheaply made and not working well at all in my daughters hair.,1

6724,Pulls my hair out and does NOT trim properly ... Wish I could return but will def be tossing it,1
6725,makes my face break out. In my fifties and getting pimples. it blocks my pores. If I had dry skin would probably be OK,3
6726,Feels good. Absorbs nicely.  I don't know about anti aging properties.  Have been using for over a month.,4
6727,Love this so much better than flossing. It makes my life so much easier with my permanent retainer in the bottom of my mouth.,5
6728,"Like how it feels and skin glows, will buy it again",4
6729,They look great and are hard to find for our make up mirror,5
6730,I have replaced my old one with this new one and it works great.  Looks good and is very easy to use.,5

6736,They are alright I suppose though the eye shadow brushes hold on to the shadow and the application is nil. Not worth it really.,3
6737,"Nothing fancy but does the job. For the price point, I recommend.",4
6738,Kind of fat and large ...but good for warmth.,3
6739,Nice product but the bottle leaks so I'm returning it.,2

 Great price on Amazon",5
6743,Gets the food out from between the teeth.  Yay!,5

6746,These work better than any other quick drying drops on the market,5

6756,"I do not have a brush with me, but I am very satisfied with the way this product looks",4
6757,Pretty designs and sturdy. I would have preferred choosing my own colors.,3
6758,Ok.  But I thought I was getting the black ones.,3
6759,It's fine. I love The body Shop but I'm not a big fan of this scent seems very artificial.,3
6760,it smells like light lavender and it mists your face. but you may as well just spray water because there are no other effects,3
6761,Just too strong a stream and always have to be refilled.  Hurt gums and didn't like it.  My husband is using it .  Mrs  Nancy Cobin,1
6762,"I love the gloves! Fit perfectly, cover all but the fingertips, beautiful color to boot!!!",5

6776,This blush is my favorite one of all! its a perfect rose - pink color. just a lil goes a long way!,5
6777,Easy to use and very reasonably priced. Our dentist asked us to get this instrument for better oral health.,4
6778,this stuff burns my face and mine did not come with a pump... just a normal cap. so weird,1
6779,"Not one of the ""snazzy"" Oral-B models, just does the job perfectly.  Get rave reviews from 2 different hygienists at quarterly check-ups.",4
6780,It's a bit narrwoer than other dental tape. But I'lluse it as opposed to nothing,4
6781,"This thing works well and it really does create much less hair in your sink.
I use it daily.",5

6789,"Although I purchased this item, I have not use it yet. It
came with the set so I bought the set.",3
6790,"Worse shave with ANY razor. Pulls, screen tore within a month, does not give a close shave ,trimmer noneffective",1
6791,Hairs constantly fell out. More disturbing is the glue holding it together started to fail after about 3 shaves. Not worth $5.,1
6792,"Great straws!  Package was opened a little bit, but straws were the perfect accessory for the weekend!",5
6793,"Smells weird, kinda like you forgot to put on deodorant ...  Can't wear it",1
6794,"3 pills at a time, 3 time per day and yes, it is working for me. Make sure you take enough and it does work.",4

6807,Great for the kids. they each have one and it has the two timers on it that really help them finish brushing.,5

6860,Just what my wife wanted. Fast delivery. Great price.,5

6865,Love this so much that I put in a blender and mix with other products.  The smell is wonderful,5
6866,My lashes look a lot thicker with the fibers.  I bought another bottle of the fibers and use it with my regular mascara.,4
6867,Great color but they are a little short for me.,3
6868,Beware. The gel is blue. I'm glad I saw that before getting it on my clothes.,3
6869,"I had been suffering for years with the only possible relief from surgery.
I found Myomin and have found myself feeling so much better.",5
6870,half of them are good but the other half are terrible and they don't really pick up makeup at all.,3
6871,"It is a solid, well-made product. Non-slip with a heavy base. The chrome finish should protect it from rust",5
6872,"works great, more glide and less irritation. Recommended!",4
6873,very very very small they don't stay in. I have lost most of them,1
6874,Awful! The silver is all pitted can't wear it total junk! I got. The same one from another vendor looks great. Buyer beware!,1
6875,nice razor does the job plus it's quieter and lighter than my old norelco thats 10 years old and still working.,5
6876,THis piece gets SO tangled.. not worth it.. and not very cute!,1
6877,"Fun, interesting, and quirky product. Try it out!",5

6888,this product works but they really have a problem with the bottle spray ...,4
6889,You get what you paid for. Very awesome price for the amount you're getting!,3
6890,This perfume smells alright but doesnt last long. I use it for when I go to work. I probably won't buy it again.,3
6891,Should last a really long time. I like the base and the cap. Should help it last longer by keeping it dry.,4
6892,nothing like advertised just chunky look once applied doesn't cover spots hocus pocus,1
6893,This isn't authentic. It is brown and doesnt feel like the aquaphor i know. My mistake of buying it from amazon.,1
6894,"Takes some practice and getting used to but once you figure it out ..... OH YA,  my wife loves it! ",5
6895,We will never use these.  The plastic is hard and it digs into your eyeballs.  It leaves ugly red marks on your skin.,1
6896,cant stand up to daily use. very hard to get replacement tips. too expensive for an item that isn't made to last.,4
6897,The best pre-shave juice ever! This lotion has been around forever and nobody has ever improved on it.,5
6898,I love this color.  It is very muted and subtle. Perfect for everyday wear with professional looks.  Definitely a new favorite.,5
6899,Nice color pigment and leaves nice stain but applies very dry. Gets caught in crevices of slightly chapped lips,3
6900,When you put it on and let it dry its so sticky no good,1
6901,I think hair is growing especially on hairline in forehead.  Will keep taking... No side effects. Wish I did  before Picture.,4
6902,leaves my skin feeling refreshed and fresh with great scent but not user-friendly cap. always end up wasting some drops falling to ground,4

6905,This is the only perfume I use .I love it. I will recommend it.it will last all day,5
6906,"Beautiful scent.  Compliments Michael Kors signature fragrance.
Moisturizing oils for skin.",5
6907,"So it works for the most spots, but if you have tough calluses , then youll need more than on treatment",3
6908,The smell was too powerful for our family to tolerate this product. It started fresh and green but intensified as it lathered with a completely different odor.,2
6909,"Good machine, comfortable and easy to clean.
not very powerful in terms of speed.",4
6910,"My wife loves it! It's exactly what she wanted, so I remain out of the doghouse - for a while.",5
6911,It was the wrong size for my machine. Other than that it was delivered fast and for a great price.,3
6912,Love this blow dryer/styler.  Wish it also came in 1/2 barrel since I have short hair.  It would give me a bit more curl.,4
6913,Does not fit brush handle and razor slips easily off center.,2
6914,Not quite what I was expecting.  It comes as a flat piece. I expected something more solid.,4
6915,Packaging was not done very well but I love the product. Smells wonderful.,4
6916,Can't get the attachment guard to work well with my hair type. I use it without and I love it now.,4
6917,"SHAVER IS EXCELLENT, THE ONLY THING MISSING IS A HOLDER TO USE WITH THE SHAVER ON YOUR BATHROOM SINK.",4
6918,They don't stick to your face and make your eyelids feel like they are on fire. Not a fan.,2
6919,The mat/pouch material sheds! I always have to wipe off the ceramic plates of my flat iron before I can use it.,3
6920,"as expected, arrived in good condition. have bought these before, not exciting but necessary.",4
6921,Good stuff. I would recommend this floss to older folks that have gaps between their teeth. Its gentler on my gums than regular floss.,4
6922,No complaints used for kids craft project. not really useful as an actual blindfold  but that  did not matter for our purposes,3
6923,I have had several trimmers and I would say this one does a nice job.. the vac only OK.,4
6924,Love it! It smells so good and really nourishes my skin. I like it better than the cucumber day cream.,5
6925,"Pungent, dirty, maybe some people like it,. I like natural fresh smells. It literally smells like body odor. I regret this purchase.",1
6926,Its a good product. Definitely makes hair thicker after two to three bottles. Doesn't really work if you care about density though,4
6927,Bag was a much cheaper quality than expected; photos and product description is deceptive.,2
6928,These get stuck in my teeth and hurt. Get the glide ones that are smoother. They are better and about the same price.,2
6929,"Almost like the hot wax, it's not so sticky, I love it",5
6930,"All the women I asked said they loved the smell of my new cologne, and the applicator is very handy.",4
6931,I wish I'd seen the full ingredients list before purchasing it.,1
6932,"This has always been my favorite after shave. Not too strong or weak. Just right, and a good price as well.",4
6933,The powder was for my mother-in-law and she loved it.  It was very expensive.  Iwould buy it more often if it were less.,4
6934,This was definitely not a real beautyblender brand sponge. It's a completely different shape and texture.,1
6935,Covered but there was a sparkle so to me it did not look natural.  Probably will not by again.,3
6936,So far so good. The pads are very durable and they truly moisturize.,4
6937,Love this mouthwash. Refreshes my mouth and keeps my teeth white and glossy! I use with the Crest 3D white toothpaste.,5
6938,Kind of oily.  Doesn't cause irritation to my skin or eyes.  I like to use it on my neck.,3
6939,"Works super well under makeup, to help last & prevent sweat from smudging. It's as if you don't sweat at all!",4
6940,Nice build. Good quality. Sharp but not as much to be scared.,4
6941,It's not authentic. It broke my hair off & smells like heavy chemicals. I have the real version and this will damage hair!,1
6942,power supply was bad when i got it had to get a replacment,1
6943,"Did not give a nice close shave like a blade does,,,back to the blade for me",1
6944,Didn't like color not a match for my skin color and didn't stay on very good.,2
6945,Not at all what I expected . This is more of a trimmer not a razor.,1
6946,Well made product just as described. Holds my brush and razor perfectly.,4
6947,Loved this belly ring but it gets stuck on clothing a lot!,4
6948,Blades are not good for shaving your head and inconsistent sometimes there sharp sometimes there crap. Not gonna buy again,2

6950,"Bought this item to for a Christmas gift they loved it .
We tell every one about it. Very good buy",5
6951,I ordered this and should of expected from the low price that it would never come. Really annoys me that this happened.,1
6952,"This is the best sunscreen. I hate putting on ss and so do my kids, but this makes it so much more bearable.",5
6953,Soft and nice looking.  Feels good around my neck.,4
6954,"Not as expected,  actually worse than expected.  Looks like made of aluminum foil. I couldn't even give them away.  Wasted money.",1
6955,Works for everything. i think this is a very nice product for this price ! The best part is that it is multifunctional !,5
6956,This product is okay but you could really just buy liquid latex and smear it in your hair instead of waiting your time with this product,2
6957,"In my opinion any product by Decleor is going to improve your skin!!
High end luxury skin care at a good price.",5
6958,"It is what it says.  Might be a bit delicate around the pinwheel portion, as it seems a bit loose but it works.",3
6959,so far they're great. 100 is super convenient too,5
6960,I love this! Real Vitamin C that really helps your Skin improve and is anti-aging.,5
6961,I like it a lot it smells really good and seems to be helping my cuticles it's a great product  I would definitely give it a shot,5
6962,It doesn't absorb right away like when you put a sunscreen on your face.,3
6963,Been buying this color  blush since 2005ish good color and wears well.,4
6964,Liked the colors but they are too big to put many on a nail. Smaller sized rhinestones would've been better.,3
6965,It is the same as what I buy from the drug store except it comes to my front door at a competitive price.,4
6966,"Very sturdy and well-made.
Perfect for a small amount of makeup.",4
6967,I felt the color was darker than the one I purchased from Sephora.,3
6968,Gift for my granddaughter and she loves it.  Very precious.,4
6969,I was not able to use the strips more than once.  Much happier with veet wax strips.,3
6970,"makes hair hard and dry if left in pass time directed but good i, guess still using it good smell",3
6971,"The material is pretty slick, it moves around a lot.",2
6972,Works really well and is super easy to use.  Matches my hair perfectly.,5
6973,Item arrived early and looked good. Despite the title saying it is two necklaces it is one double sided dog tag. Still good quality.,3
6974,Doesn't hold any of my normal razors.  They twist right out of the razor holder side.,3
6975,I wouldn't recommend this for cleaning your teeth. It makes a loud noise and doesn't really do much. Very pricey for what it does.,3
6976,helped me keep my asthma at bay when used at my parents home that was dusty and apparently had black mold. thank you for this great product,4
6977,Disappointed in this curling iron.  The tip is too short to properly hold without burning fingers when curling hair.,1
6978,Not very quality. I guess you get what you pay for.,2
6979,Nothing special for the price.  Not understanding the hype for the product.,3
6980,My wife has developed arthritis in her feet and toes and this helps keep them 'in place'. Not for open toe shoes of course.,4
6981,"Took a LONG time to get here,  but it was most definitely worth the wait!",3
6982,"I felt nauseous after taking this thing, no mint flavor & it taste gross.",1
6983,It broke after the 2nd time i used it. It didn't work good either way. Crappy product i wouldn't recommend it.,1
6984,The only thing sadder than reading the reviews for a loofah is writing one.,4
6985,Had to unknot it but that didn't take too much time. Love it,4
6986,Blow air but no heat... do not know how to return if it heated it would most likely be great.,1
6987,Easy to use. No itchy scalp afterward.  Smells good.  Much darker color than expected!,3
6988,"Didnt receive exactly what was shown, but I made it work.",3
6989,Too small of bottles I didn't realize when I ordered them!,3
6990,"Well, the only thing is that if you have a very strong hair it won't work very well on you...",3
6991,"The picture shows nice thick bars is soap. When they arrive, they are pretty thin. Nice soaps though.",2
6992,I go through a lot of Aquaphor. I use it to prevent chafing and lather it on thick. Works well.,4
6993,"I like the product so far, but I do have to say I was disappointed how far they filled the bottle. it was only 2/3 full.",4
6994,I have terrible bunions so short of surgery only say the product gave some needed relief.,3
6995,This product smells amazing!  It works great for dry skin during these cold winter months. The seller is great!  Thank you!,5
6996,"Item shown not delivered. Updated, smaller product delivered.",3
6997,I got this for a friend for Christmas and she was so excited. I know it sounds weird. I have been doing this for years,5
6998,was what I needed for an old belt sander to work on a deck fit ok fair priced for the amount,4
6999,"I couldn't smell anything but BABY POWDER, sweet and plain.  I hated the scent.  The brand is great but this scent is not.",2
7000,My daughters hair is still very frizzy. Didn't help tame it. Great smell. We still use it for brushing.,3
7001,I love this eye cream. Have sensitive eyes; this works well and does not irritate eyes.,5
7002,It's a typical hairbrush. Still looking for one that doesn't tear your hair!,2
7003,Still searching for a perfume that smells like lilac. This isn't it,2
7004,I love the quality of this product though I could do without the triclosan and phthalates.,4
7005,Wow this thing is extremely uncomfortable to use. Feels like sandpaper on both sides; I have to try something else.,2
7006,They are ok. Prices kept going up each month to make it not wort the cost. The cost to value was not worth it to me.,3
7007,"I'm changing from 5 stars to 2. The brushes ended up falling off the holders. Cheaply made. The bristles ended up
Falling out.",2
7008,didn't do much. pfb and tendskin are much better,2
7009,I got his for my office.  The price is right.  It works great on moles and other small lesions.  The price is very reasonable.,5
7010,I like the brushes but there a lil to soft for my liking,3
7011,"Good product, but should come with additional  rubber holds. I will by this product again.  Maybe try to make a little smaller.",4
7012,Not the quality I was expecting based upon previous purchases.  I will be returning to my old vender.,3
7013,they are too heavy and move around in the bras and feel awkward I am not using them for now,1
7014,I have previously written a review on this product.  It works fine and that is why I keep reordering it.,5
7015,Very fragile. But they are beautiful and look great layered. And can't beat the price!,4
7016,Only bad thing is it makes your cuticles orange so you have to wash it off,4
7017,This was my hubby's first electric shaver.  So far so good.  He did have some razor burn/irritation at first but that seems to have subsided.,4
7018,Very pretty but hard to get the ball to twist on. I had to try several times before it stayed on. The bar is kinda short.,3
7019,Looks as pictured. Fits 3 rolls in the base if you stack them up to the rim.,4
7020,The soft side help break up dirt while the hard side scrub out difficult stains. I tend to use less soap while having a fresh longer clean!,5
7021,Gets the dead skin off. But in the end my skin is the same.,3
7022,Fun novelty item. Great gift. Hard to squeeze.,3
7023,Great makeup. Brushes a little flimsy and lose their bristles.,4
7024,This was sold to me being expired. I would like a new one that is not expired as I would like to continue buying this product.,1
7025,Great product and the price for the quantity is great.,5
7026,it is soothing as a lotion and I like the smell,4
7027,I cannot tell that it does anything-- just  putting another gel on my face. I think it was a waste of my money.,2
7028,The absolute Best for dry skin....you see results the day after! Would give it 10 stars!,5
7029,"Great price. I gave these out to many family and friends.
Great oil grade. I add my essential Oils to this it's great.",4
7030,Works fine but marerial sucks 3 days and its broken already,2
7031,I do really like this cleanser it has a great scent and it has really evened out my skin tone and balanced my combination skin.,4
7032,After using this product for 2 weeks the stop button on the hand unit started sticking and is no longer useful.,2
7033,"Great product for fine hair, too bad it is discontinued by Bain De Terre",5
7034,Received fast. Item is as expected. You have to cut for size you need and it is good for winter as well as protects the sole.,5
7035,Buy Vaseline.  It's cheaper and has same ingredient.,3
7036,They are super small and I got repeats of the same Colors,1
7037,Beautiful colors. Work great but Some were a little broken ,3
7038,"so far so good, a great product.
Good to use during pregnancy.
I would recommended it to my friends and family.",4
7039,Very hard to find smaller brush like this.  Works great for my short hair.,5
7040,"The silver finish wears off to reveal a bronze.
Also, isn't a base metal. Turns your skin green.
Beware",3
7041,Good quality product that was received promptly and intact. Always receive many compliments when using this product. I will order again.,5
7042,The product works fine.  The life of the heads is not very good - about 1 year and the expense is too high.,3
7043,This did not give my hair volume. It did make it very soft which actually weighed it down more.,1
7044,My daughter bought this for me because she knows how much I love it and sometimes its hard to find in the stores.,5
7045,"This felt nice going on, but I didn't notice much of a difference.",3
7046,Works ok but the smell is too strong and lingers forever on your electric razor.,3
7047,Wasn't too crazy about these...I like Monistat Soothing Care Powder Gel and much rather use that any day.,3
7048,Drys my hair out after a couple months of use. Had to change.,2
7049,Good product helps fight off basic illnesses. Also helpful when traveling on airlines. My kids use inner defense product too.,4
7050,"BAD DESIGN AND IT IS VERY LOUD,MESSY,AND THE HOSE IS ALWAYS TANGLING UP. DON'T WAIST YOUR MONEY!",2
7051,I like this kit for traveling. I have not tried the product yet as I will take it with me in June while on vacation,4
7052,The shape didn't fit my face at all.  There was too much light that leaked in through the nose area.,2
7053,Love the product gave a fullness and lengthy. Last till you wash off makeup.,4
7054,The Duckbill Valves did not fit my Flanges properly. Then the milk leaked into the tubing.,1
7055,This fits well but alittle loose around the middle...rather have that than too tight,4
7056,"WAX SUCKS DOESNT PULL OFF A HAIR, BEST BET IS TO GUY WAX FROM SALLYS BEAUTY SUPPLY",2
7057,"It was okay, but the smell made my eyes water. Didn't really notice a difference in my skin.",2
7058,Brush opening too narrow. I recommend finding a brush holder with a 30mm opening.,2
7059,"Not what I expected, looks ok but not as good as the pic.",2
7060,"Love the smell, the thickness, the way it makes my skin feel and look. Also love the companion body wash. My new favorite brand!",5
7061,This haircutting cape is a hair magnet. No matter how hard you brush the hair off... it literally sticks to it.,1
7062,The clippers arrived in a case held together with scotch tape. They are dull and too big to do anything. Very disappointed.,1
7063,"Cream may be,good just not for me....not,good for sensitive skin",1
7064,"The colors look really nice and I was so excited to get mine. Sadly, the blue was everywhere !! :(",1
7065,Love this product BUT at the end of the day my face is a little greasy price is great 2 cheaper than walmart.,4
7066,"My dentist suggested I get a water flosser, and I chose the WaterPik. I'm enjoying ease in cleaning food from those small crevasses with ease!",5
7067,It fits in my hand well and has a nice weight no matter what way you hold the razor. I love it!,5
7068,Sorry.  It served its purpose but so does baby powder.  I use cornstarch baby powder.  No point paying the premium.,1
7069,Eh...just ok. The orange is a little too over powering for my taste. I like the patchouli to dominate =),3
7070,"One still needs to floss, but between flossing and the Water pik most everything is removed.",3
7071,Works as advertised and lasts a long time (based on my prior purchase some time ago;  the aroma could be a bit stronger.,4
7072,First time using this product.  It's a bit sticky so your hand sticks to your hair but the texture it left behind was nice.,4
7073,it was awesome my niece loved it it came early a+ job,5
7074,I'm a b cup and it only stayed lifted for 5.whole mins.,1
7075,this shaver is the best I got. power shaving. smooth cutting. long lasting energy. fast charging.,4
7076,product did not do anything for me after using it for over 4 months.,1
7077,"too loud.
it sounds like the motor is going to explode.
I'm not sure how long it's going to last.",2
7078,"Completely different color that on the photo!
It does not look beautiful.
Too bright",1
7079,Somewhat disappointed.  Pillow does not stay in place when it is put onto another.,1
7080,Have about 3-4 units in closet not using the shaver right now,4
7081,Horrible fabric. Doesn't move at all. Waste of money,1
7082,"This product may work fine for someone else, but it was too moist and kept my toe from healing",1
7083,"i really like the sent of this cologne, unfortunately the scent doesn't last very long on me. i would buy a large bottle though.",4
7084,I'm a male as my name indicates and out of all the color I get pink... really,1
7085,Color is lighter than my tone and looks shimmery rather than matte.,3
7086,Seems not the one I regularly buy from Nordstrom. Doubtful Clinic Serum!,2
7087,Received a duplicate product. The oil does not smell as original Sesa oil. Also the oil turns solid during winter. Never buy this.,1
7088,Item works great. Keeps area dry. Fast shipping. Would highly recommend product. Have used product for almost a year. A must for athletes.,5
7089,This works okay but if you don't use a guard be prepared to bleed a little.  The battery is pretty good and I rarely charge it.,4
7090,It works. Feels flimsy but does the trick!  I was expecting a little more rigidity.,3
7091,Seemed like old stock. Did not feel good when applied. Will not purchase again .,1
7092,It does what it claims to do.  My husband uses it for his bridge.,3
7093,"Good for the price, but it had a slight chemical smell.",4
7094,A Great product. But these jars are too small and environmentally and economically irresponsible.,2
7095,"a bad purchase. It is impossible to wear it on lip, since it keeps falling and there is big chance that you can swallow the magnet.",1
7096,The brushes are great i especially love the eye shadow brushes the only thing is that the blush brush was smaller than expected but overall loved everything,4
7097,"I used this cream when i return from the beach, when your skin is too Dry and crackle from the sun and wind.",5
7098,Not at all.  The heads don't fit the razor.  Ended up buying  a new razor.,1
7099,"The rosewaster smells delightful and is refreshing. However, the bottle was simply thrown in the box and delivered cracked and leaking.",3
7100,"Very disappointing performance, needs more pressure to do an adequate job between teeth, and under bridges. My old model, same brand, is better.",1
7101,"does what it is supposed to do...good quality, nice design, better than older models..great price it' $14 more at Walmart!",4
7102,Total crap! Do not waste your time and money. The thing will no stay on the wall no matter how creative you get.,1
7103,They haven't given me any problems. They are really nice,5
7104,Purchased to replace the one that I lost.  Very helpful to clean razor.,4
7105,"i like it easy to use, i might by more in the future
i asked my friends to by one",5
7106,I does not work for me. It is not strong enough for my thick hair. I would have send it back but threw out the packaging.,1
7107,"Do not buy these, they do not work well and are very cheap and break easily.",1
7108,This stuff did not work for me at all. Didn't even make a dent.,1
7109,"Ugh, just as will sprinkle ashes on your head. It is about as noticable as a second head. Go bald, save your money.",1
7110,"Medium sharpness out of the box. i give them a ""C"". But the price is right.",3
7111,My allergies make me too sensitive to wear perfume but I can wear this and I love it.,4
7112,Love this product.  It is part of my daily routine to freshen up and moisturize my skin.,5
7113,"I really like it! I have braces and its great removing food from my braces, but the pressure isn't consistent. I hope it lasts.",4
7114,"This stuff is amazing, clears up dry and chapped skin in no time.  Been using it for a couple of years now.",4
7115,"I received the product in good conditions, without hits or damages, but after add water the ""air""floss just spray that.. air",1
7116,This product works really good. If you have soft skin you can't use it every day.,5
7117,I used this once and tossed it. The product description says,1
7118,"Sounds a little big, should follow the direction with the beard, slightly less convenient, overall is good.",4
7119,It is too soon to tell if this product would work for me (for my hair).  The smell isn't that bad.,4
7120,It even glows under a black light. It is an original color that I love.,5
7121,It was the bag I was just looking for thanks .and very affordable.and very nicely done.we are very pleased with it and will recommend.,5
7122,Easy to adjust trim length. The vacuum works as well as expected...not perfect but fairly  effective.,4
7123,I love this product.  Very smooth to put on it feels good on the skin.,5
7124,My husband does't feel like he is getting a close shave with this product has gone back to razor.,2
7125,"Is not a good product. Don't waste your money buying this... and what makes it worse, doesn't work at all!!!!",1
7126,Awful. Didn't work and I could not return it.,1
7127,Not as powerful as I thought it would be.  Takes a while to dry hair.  Good to follow-up a higher wattage blow-dryer.,3
7128,this is nice. not as great as the facial massage jade roller so I didn't give it 5 stars.,3
7129,"Jars are soooooooooo small, good product. But the size should be listed on the add. I went through all small containers in one use.",2
7130,Went through 4 bottles of this stuff at 3 capsules 3 times a day.  Can't tell it did anything.,2
7131,This stuff just didn't deliver the results that it said it would. It's a regular face wash...that's it,2
7132,"Smells good, but doesn't bubble up as much as, Dr. Bronner's.",4
7133,"I thought they would be longer, but they will work",4
7134,what was I thinking????? once and done,2
7135,"Broke when I attempted to put it on, guess I'll try superglue..",1
7136,"A great manikin to take to state board, great for 90 degree cuts and state board perms, thermals and relaxers.",4
7137,I think this product had been opened before.  It was watery and the seal had been broken. Did not like,1
7138,We use this for our cloth diapers to keep the smell away when we are waiting to wash them.  It works well.,4
7139,Closest shave ever.  Love the cleaning method.  Just run under hot water and your done.  Rxcellent shaver.,5
7140,This thing really works! my hair feels so amazing and it smells awesome...I just thought the packaging was a little small,4
7141,It has a few imperfections but it gets the job done.,4
7142,"They're sharp, but don't stay that way long.  Overall, a pretty good deal though.",4
7143,"Very disappointed,  not at all what I thought it would be. No instructions,  couldn't even put it up",1
7144,"The cream broke me out, however it might just have been my skin. It is very moisturizing and spreads easily. Customer service is great to.",4
7145,Nice color but the lipgloss is what makes it even nicer!,3
7146,It's really thick watered it down worth coco water.,3
7147,It did what it was supposed to do stop the pan,3
7148,"I like this block, however I still have to make a couple of passes with this to close any nicks from shaving.",4
7149,Has actually made my cuticles worse! They have never cracked so badly as they are now after having used this oil about 3 or 4 times.,1
7150,Its nice to be able to add the charcoals to other moisturizing cleaners I have but otherwise I don't see it clearing up my skin.,3
7151,"Easy to use and effective, but incredibly loud and has a tendency to leak.",4
7152,Horrible product! It crumbles up in the 1st 2weeks of use. Don't waste your money!!!,1
7153,"This is a great perfume but a little pricey.

There are cheaper high quality perfumes that smell just as good.",3
7154,"I bought this Norelco shaver to replace a similiar, but older, model that I had used for several years.  Shave is great.",5
7155,These glasses don't work well - wish I had kept the packaging to return them . . .,1
7156,Smells great but only lasts half the day on my 10 year old daughter.,3
7157,"works great, I followed the directions and my 3 year olds hair is not tangly",4
7158,Came quickly and works well. Fit a very large bar of soap which is what I was looking for!,5
7159,They are small fitting.  I would have preferred a choice of sizes. They don't stretch enough for my liking. thanks,3
7160,Great product but stickiness doesn't last very long...super but somewhat disposable.,3
7161,They are very nice colors just wish the bottom part would be a little thicker so that they wouldn't fall off all the time.,4
7162,Didn't get sick since I take it! My stress level is low as well thanks to inner defense!,5
7163,"Tried for one week despite the stinging .  It works, but it has left white spots and sores on my tongue. Do not buy this product.",1
7164,"These brushes are not very good because the 'hair' in it falls out easily, and it all falls apart super easy.",2
7165,"Misleading. Description says 2 pack, when received theres was only one stick!",1
7166,The only complaint I have is that it is noisy.  My old one ran very quite.  I don't know why this one is so noisy.,4
7167,"The shampoo is very watery, and I did not see too much of a difference in my dandruff.",2
7168,Works very nice but very overpriced for the little amount you get.,4
7169,"This trimmer does what I need, but it will *not* get you the baby-butt smoothness shown on the packaging.",4
7170,"Leaves a residue on your lips that is clumpy :-(  I had chunks on my lips all day, it was gross and felt gross.",1
7171,I love pumping it! Makes be smile. BPA free for life.,4
7172,I ordered a purple scarf and received a black one. However it serves the same purpose,2
7173,"Good right out of the boxes.  Need some patience to decide how to clean it, but then all is great",5
7174,"the product really does work. i had really little lashes on the bottom of my eyes, and now they're more visible.",4
7175,"my skin appears more even and smooth.
I will order it again.
Arkansas",4
7176,This is the best brand of blush.love the colors too.,1
7177,"Good stuff. Well packaged too. This stuff holds well and doesn't look ""wet"" if applied to dry hair.",5
7178,Have used waterpiks for years and would not want to be without one. Easy to use and faster than flossing.,5
7179,"It definitely works, but a little greasy/oily than I'd expected.",4
7180,I expected better results using this but did not see a big difference. It felt good on my skin and smells wonderful though.,4
7181,Yes I like to take bubble Baths!  This is the best product at the most reasonable price.,4
7182,Loved it finally used it I am impressed a few drops and there it goes,5
7183,"Great soap! Smells great, good for acne & troublesome skin!! Smells just like peppermint & soap lasts about a month",5
7184,I like this product! All in one for what I need,5
7185,"Found out you only need to use one of these if you have space between your teeth, like the football commentator on fox.",2
7186,Looks nice and well made but its not as large as I hopped. Plenty of compartments to organize with and like the color,3
7187,The product smells like alcohol. I don't notice a difference after using for 1 month.  I'm patiently waiting for it to work......,3
7188,Helps a lot.  Keeps down the chronic swelling from hammer toe fix.,4
7189,These take time Getting used to but cause no hair damage or pain. It's very innovative and for long hair it's really effective .,4
7190,"This product did not apply well, it was squishy and clumpy. Not a good look.",1
7191,"I've been buying these tooth brushes monthly for a year for the family -
they're decent, affordable - just right!",4
7192,I received the product and it wouldn't stick to my shower tile and just fell off.  It was a waste of money.,1
7193,Both cleanser and moisturizer had rank smell.  I will not repurchase.,1
7194,This does not fit universally. I could not get it to stay on my hairdryer.,2
7195,Good price for these refills. They are hard to find in stores.,5
7196,Your better off purchasing the paste version of amber the oil solution is diluted big time it doesnt wven smell like amber.,1
7197,"Total crap.  flimsy, don't hold up at all.  better to use a toothpick or floss.  this tries to be ""in-between"" and fails",1
7198,The sling was a bit small but the bag was still perfect im just going to get it longer elsewhere no biggie,4
7199,I did not have the benefit of sampling this particular scent. I am somewhat disappointed with it as I find the citrus scent is too overpowering.,3
7200,"Not as good as my Norelco 7775X Cool Skin Shaver, but gives a decent shave for the price.",4
7201,Loved it! It is refreshing and provides radiance to my acne prone T zone.  I don't know what to do without it now.,5
7202,I bought this to remove fine facial hair but didn't find they did a thorough and adequate job like hot wax would do.,2
7203,"The soap itself is fine, but the cutting is not even, and several slices are quite thin..",4
7204,Does not even fit around ponytail. I do have quite a bit of hair though!,1
7205,"Makes my facial pores smaller and I swear  that my wrinkles seem less obvious around my eyes.  Much appreciated
since large pores run in the family.",5
7206,Cost too much and is not good for very many cleanings. I think it is high due to the process and packaging.,2
7207,I love the different colors available I would recommend this product. I like how the gems have their own snapped container.,4
7208,"I love giving myself a little finger massage, but honestly I can't tell a difference.",3
7209,"I think it is helping my aging, peeling nails.",4
7210,Love that it reaches inside areas not reachable with the shorter version.,4
7211,"Was great at first, then died unexpectedly... not even new batteries would make it work.",3
7212,I would get it again.  It is a decent value.  It blocks odors and perspiration just like it claims.  It also smells pretty good.,4
7213,"I have only used these and Wilkinson Sword, and the two are comparable to each other, i like both brands",5
7214,Don't like that the pocket is at the top instead of the bottom okay is tha t enough s i,2
7215,"Good product for our baking operation, but there is no nutritional information which I need for my formulas. Get that on the bottle please.",4
7216,Leaves stubble. Will not shave close enough for me. Will be looking for a better blade. I'm very disappointed.,1
7217,"I have used this product for years, with good results.  Glad to be able to buy it from Amazon",4
7218,"Wasn't the bit that was described or shown in picture.  However, they did refund my money so happy about that",1
7219,"Hasnt given me any problems, clean taste and thick. Ordering the PG now that I am running low, will definitely order again.",5
7220,Worked great at first but after 4 months started losing its power,3
7221,The product works as described.  Only used the regular water pik attachement. Never used the other ones before.  The water container is a bit small.,4
7222,Best product I have ever used. I would recommend this for everyone.,5
7223,Very soft fibers. After a cut and style it is great.,4
7224,The product did exactly what we needed for an activity that required blindfolding our staff members at our first 2013 meeting,4
7225,Didn't really come with all the pieces shown in the picture. It's missing to items,4
7226,Great razors for the $$. I've been using them since the beginning of the year and they work great.,5
7227,LOVE THIS THING! It's awesome. Exactly as described. Just lean over the sink to avoid a mess. Fast delivery too!,5
7228,Not the best color for me but it works when I mix it with another color. I like it because it's very moisturizing.,4
7229,wore it once and it broke twice. I thought it was a good deal but it was horrible!!!!!!,2
7230,I like this face cream. It didn't feel heavy on my skin like other face creams tend to do.,5
7231,"Good for my elderly mom, who couldn't turn the key in her new apt. (It takes quite a bit of force).",4
7232,It's been a while and I haven't really noticed any difference and I use it as directed.,3
7233,Still to soon to tell..I believe it is a good product will be ordering more.,3
7234,Smells funny and you only get a smell after you put a ton on. The scrub doesn't come out unless you force it. Overall a waste,2
7235,It cleans pretty well. I will certainly recommend this. My dentist already saw the changes when I went visit last time.,5
7236,I'm giving it a 2 star because of the color changing. But this product does not cure well.,2
7237,It works very well. I wish it has a spare regular tip for an extra user rather than all the other special tips,4
7238,Color is a litle lighter than I expected but I do love the smooth application and it seems to last all day for me.,4
7239,"Although it is a better alternative than most facial moisturizers, this one still contains questionable ingredients.",4
7240,So glad to be able to find it. I would buy again.,5
7241,"dont waiste your money, its stupid,.it doesnt work.",1
7242,"Not easy to find in stores, glad I know I can get the same good product that I use all the time here!",4
7243,This soap had no fragrance whatsoever.  Love Bergamot but was very disappointed in this soap.,1
7244,Wonderful smelling and makes me feel like I'm giving my hair a treat!,4
7245,These were too drying for my hair. I went back to using JR Liggets Moisture bar.,2
7246,Item served its purpose for the short time I was incapacitated,3
7247,The order was for a pack of 3 and it was delivered with only 1 tube.,1
7248,Do not buy these this is a ripoff.... only received 1 not a four pack... received 12/15/2017,1
7249,Works fine..but just a bit heavier than I would like.,4
7250,I have used this for 6 weeks now (the time after which they guarantee results). I can't see any difference to my lashes whatsoever.,1
7251,"This is good pigmented color and the best blush I've ever owned. Sleek, small case is a plus as well.",4
7252,Fast delivery. The scissor is okay but the black case is not well made. It looks ugly and cheap. Overall 4 stars,4
7253,Great as a gentle cleanser but not deep cleaning . If your face gets dirty I suggest the stone crop face wash instead. Good Luck :-),3
7254,"product does not work.i have been using it for a month and a half now ,with no results.",2
7255,I notise that the hairs were coming off from the brushes that really turned me off. Also one of my brushes craked.!,2
7256,it's my Forever comb.  Never had anything like this in 60 years.  It should be part of Obamacare give away.,5
7257,"it is small and handy to carry in the purse.
l think is ok. but better to buy in stores.",3
7258,"This seems to clean my gums quite well.  When I add a little white vinegar, it cleans the tarter off even better.",4
7259,"Broke within 6 mos.  Before the handle stopped allowing water through, it was very good.  I wish they'd make this product better.",2
7260,THIS WAS A GIFT PURCHASED LAST YEAR FOR MY DAUGHTER WHO ABSOLUTELY LOVES CURVE FOR WOMEN AND WHO COULD PASS UP THE PRICE I PAID!!,5
7261,"Didn't work, never worked. Piece of crap.",1
7262,"I like the product, but don't buy it again.. It's too expensive.",3
7263,Too expensive and uselless attachments. I just wanted a simple flosser,3
7264,Fine for grey roots between coloring but not good for thinning hair.,4
7265,"Love how they stand up on their own. No more toothbrush holder needed. Also, like how it brushes.",5
7266,"I like it, not sure if I notice smaller pores, but it is refreshing and softening to my skin, I used as needed",3
7267,"After using Dermalogica Dynamic Skin Recovery SPF50, I would never return to using Clinque again, which I had used on my skin for over 25 years..",5
7268,Not human hair but it was a gift and they recipient loved it. So I'll give it 3 stars.,3
7269,Still getting used to it.  But so far so good.,4
7270,"Love the flex of these, and the ability to deep clean",4
7271,I am still trying to determine if this is effective or not.,3
7272,"A quirky little product that seems to work..keep it wet when you use it.
This is not a steptic-pencil type thing....",4
7273,"I have used this for my hands, on dishes in the sink, and in the washing machine.  I like it very much.",4
7274,Want to purchase but seems expensive.  Not sure if the reviews are legit.,1
7275,love this product!  got the order before it was due as well,5
7276,This trimmer pulls quite a bit if you're not careful but for the price it isn't bad.,3
7277,It does reduce static in my hair and scent is fine. My granddaughter loves it when shes here for a sleepover ,5
7278,Daughter is a lifeguard at the lake and she said it was great.,4
7279,My mom loves her set & hasn't complained about shedding.,4
7280,So disappointed. For the price to not include a charger?!? Returned it!!,1
7281,"Si ayud creo, pero no de la forma que esperaba segn los comentarios.",3
7282,Bought for three different people as a gift it was great!,5
7283,Essie doesn't disappoint! This color is a dark purply black. It goes on smoothly and doesn't leave bubbles.,5
7284,The only person who can wear this is 5 year old with the hair color of a Barbie doll. Waste of money.,1
7285,Heavy weight and good stand for the money - I would purchase again.,4
7286,"My son loves the patterns.  I was very happy with the texture, flexible and nonirritating to the skin.  Work great",5
7287,These became dull from the point to about 1/2 way back after 10 uses on small dog. The front/pointy half is often the most important for trimming,1
7288,Not happy at all!!!! Fake fake FAKE!!,1
7289,Works well for certain positions. The foam is stiff and provides good support.,4
7290,"I used it, but everyone in my family told me they hated it.",1
7291,"Do not notice any difference, actually takes longer to get ready as you have to wait for this to dry.",2
7292,"Great oil, use it on my hair, and really helps.  Works as described.",5
7293,Love the fragrance.  Purchased for the men in the family for xmas.,5
7294,Works good and I have xl giant man hands and have no trouble holding this.,4
7295,I love this brand but this lotion is overpoweringly sweet. Gives me a headache.,3
7296,Buy a hundred pack of Astra.  This is just ok.,3
7297,PRODUCT IS FINE AND SHIPPMENT CAME IN ON TIME AND AT A FAIR PRICE.  WOULD RECOMMEND AND AM SATISFIED.,4
7298,It's looks amazing on BUT it turned on the first wear & no I didn't get into any water with it !!!,3
7299,This a great stand.  I have several brushes and razors and the fit great,5
7300,I've used Norelco cordless shavers since 1964 and never had a bad one.,5
7301,"Very thick once on hair, gritty feeling. Much lighter than I imagined, tried to return due to this, but it was non returnable.",3
7302,Good product have used for several years.  Also use face wash and face cream. Will buy this and other products in the line.,4
7303,"Very good for adults.  The normal adult sonicare has too much power, this one is perfect for kids and adults.  The right price, too.",4
7304,What can I say. Waterpic is the best tool I've used for my gums and teeth.,5
7305,The gauge is too small and keeps falling out of my nose.,3
7306,So good and spicy. A real nice bite once on. I use it as a splash. Very nice,4
7307,I'm still fairly new to using safety razors. These blades seem to do a good job and they showed up to my door on time.,4
7308,Very good quality. Sturdy. Shave is great. Close cut Highly recommend this shaver. The trimmer is a great feature also.,4
7309,just replace your shaving heads once or twice a year and you continue to get a easy smooth shave. also remember the shaving gel/lotion.,1
7310,"i use this every day, when you are finished using thisi in the shower your skin feels awesommmeee. Good buy",4
7311,"Love the smell of this cream - nice consistency, too.",4
7312,Anyone who has curly hair should truly be using this product. Love the Deva Curl line. Will definitely continue using.,4
7313,Super cute navel ring! Was a little bigger than what I thought but looks great!,4
7314,The item has a lens that popped out. Cant return or replace.,1
7315,Prepare to only wear it a couple of times because it is extremely poorly made.,3
7316,The colors aren't true to color and shipping took awhile. honestly not a fan of these blushes,4
7317,"Of course it kills germs.

The main ingredient is..ta daaaaa...

ALCOHOL!!!!

It might smell good but it is one expensive sanitizer.",1
7318,I have been using this product for quite a while now. I really like it!,4
7319,"GReat for your teeth and lives you with a great fresh and clean denture, very good price for a great product",5
7320,I love this shampoo . It leaves what hair l have left nice and clean.lt also smells nice.,5
7321,ordered for a lighted make up vanity mirror & did not even come on after installation,1
7322,"It didn't last very long the cord leaked at the handle connector and broke off....No way to repair it, less then 2 years old...",1
7323,"Best non DDS office product available, good price for all three!
Results are great just beaware if you have sensitive teeth...",5
7324,Love the smell of Jean Nate like the powder puff version instead of in upright containers~,4
7325,They have balls in the back which I didn't want,3
7326,Awesome!  They arrived on time and did not have a bad smell or missing pieces as others experienced.  Great price and beautiful curls.,5
7327,I shave... I needed razors... best to buy in bulk... these are a good deal,5
7328,This is GREAT for the ends and edges of your hair and smells like coffee! ,4
7329,Didn't realize this is not waterproof. When I opened the battery compartment it was soaked.,2
7330,Great quality hair. Made well. Looks natural. I would definitely buy it again,4
7331,"Ornament is very nice ,but no sooner chain has faded",2
7332,This was awful. Doesn't look anything like the picture and is impossible to put on and wear.,1
7333,This brand of seaweed powder is very smooth when mixed with liquid and definitely has the smell of seaweed. High quality! Would purchase again.,5
7334,"The fragrance is ""true"". It is exactly, as advertised. I love it! I definitely will order it, again, when needed.",5
7335,Great quality and price.  Used on my face and tight muscles on my back.,5
7336,Haven't needed them yet...but when I do.....,3
7337,The only use for this product is as a rag.,1
7338,"I like this product, because it leaves your hair looking natural, and its not damaging your hair.",4
7339,Actually a great primer. I know you'll get flash-back in pictures but if it's a sunny day I definitely recommend it!,5
7340,"The only brand I use, worth the extra bucks. Bought several bottles to hold me over for a short time.",4
7341,Nothing special but it works fine.  I have no complaints.,4
7342,This stuff stinks. I couldn't use it because the smell was overwhelming.,1
7343,I have been with the bracelets for about a month and 2 of them already ripped,1
7344,It just wasn't for me. It seemed to crack very easily. The color was great though!,3
7345,"Covers grey perfectly and does not have a scent, which I encountered on other grey cover-ups",4
7346,This product did not keep dry as advertised.  However I was golfing in 105 plus degree heat.  Have not tried it when temp was under 100,2
7347,"Alas, still too light but the quality is nice. :)",3
7348,Only have used for 30 days ! I have not noticed a big diffence! It doesn't smell and is easy to use,3
7349,"I did not receive a fraction of the pearls shown in the picture, so I am a little frustrated.",1
7350,"Don't know. Tried it a couple weeks ago and again last week.
  From what I read it takes a few months to see some improvement.",1
7351,"I was so anxious to receive
This product isn't the best one( of course not) but it's very nice and I really like it",4
7352,I really like this bulb.  It is cost effective and it is helping my skin.,5
7353,Maybe it's just me. I can be the only one seeing this. I feel lied to.,1
7354,Very convenient to leave the tube on your desk at work to moisturize your hands during the day. Good value for the price.,4
7355,very gentle and smells good. i'd definitely recommend this to every men. The citrus smell wakes me up in the morning,4
7356,I bought this to mix my own spray on hair conditioner.  It holds moisture in very well.,4
7357,"old stock, the package falls apart, but the floss is ok, just had to hold without the pieces of the package to hold.",4
7358,"These were such a waste of money, they were so flimsy she wasn't able to use them at all.",1
7359,Very cute. I'm giving to my 7 yr. Old for christmas. I liked so much I ordered another one for my niece.,4
7360,Cute but definitely not 20 gauge. I normally wear 20 gauge and these are way smaller. More like a 22 or 24.,4
7361,Have used this product numerous times in the past and it works very quickly.,5
7362,Terrible.  Way to small for a teen!  The hairline doesn't come forward enough.  Don't buy this wig.  You will be disappointed,1
7363,"I got this for my Wife, she love it and I 'm Happy for that.",5
7364,Definitely not for sensitive skin. I ended up with welts and peeling skin. Not good.,1
7365,"They're a bit hard, but u get what u pay for I guess. And btw one of the brushes broke like wtf",3
7366,I was pretty disappointed. These are hard to work with.,1
7367,"This is great stuff.

Man you will get a lot of bubbles and the smell is nice and relaxing.

I would recommend it for sure.",5
7368,This is so much nicer than the old type waterpik. It is more hygenic and easier to set up and looks so much better.,4
7369,"Electric razor is cheap, good, much better than 20 year old Norelco it replaced. It gives a close shave, rarely needs to be recharged.",4
7370,These are great!  I love the variety of sizes and especially the very small sizes.  They look very lovely on the nails.,5
7371,"For the price it should work better and last longer.
Also need a better spray bottle.",3
7372,I wasn't too crazy about them-but I will say that my daughter likes using them-so she got a free bunch! To each his own!!,2
7373,Got my order fast a nice little set of brushes for when you on the go overall really happy w it,4
7374,It works as was expected as it is a replacement unit for one that the water line developed a leak.,4
7375,Great product!  I saw a difference in just 3 applications.,4
7376,Great wig but was a little small for my head.,4
7377,"Do nut put under makeup.  It is sticky and too much.  Great for arms, legs, and back. I like the smell very earthy",2
7378,Very happy with this set up. Everything in the picture was sent to me and it works great.,4
7379,Stiff tubing is a drawback and also that you have to hold the button down to make the water stop flowing. Otherwise a great product.,4
7380,"they arrived earlier than i expected , i love them , there were some duplicates but over all they fit nice and i love the colors ",4
7381,"This item is cute, but incredibly delicate; and takes am extremely long time to arrive",3

The scent has a apple smell to it.

4 ounces is a good size.",3
7383,Purchased for my husband.  He is very satisfied with this product and would recommend it.,4
7384,This is just a hyped-up version of any silicone-based serum you can buy in any drug or grocery store. Don't waste your money.,1
7385,love the scent of KAI but these 2 sets smelled bad I don't know if they are old or from a smoking facility. Unusable waste of money,1
7386,Alotttt smaller then I thought but still great for someonr who is a beginner in face makeup application used it as a birthday gift !,3
7387,Just okay. Hardly ever use any of the colors.,3
7388,This product is very disappointing.  The suction cups do not stay and the product itself does not stay together.  I am returning for a refund.,1
7389,"Phillips has changed the package, but still works fine.

I do the full clean in their auto cleaner whenever the battery needs a charge.",5

7391,"SO FAR GOOD. HAVE NOT FINISHED USING FOR THE TIME NEEDED TO
SEE BEST RESULTS.BUT SEEMS OK FOR RIGHT NOW",3
7392,Blades cut like a champ. They become dull after 2 uses. Will definitely buy more.,5
7393,"Not great for course hair, but ok if you just want to do your bikini line.  Did not leave razor burns",3
7394,Thought the kit would come with everything needed to get started but it was missing the powder recommended.,3
7395,"Great product!  I've found it much cheaper locally, but it still does a great job with clearing up teen acne.",4
7396,There ok for what you pay but the part that goes between the toes makes them hurt so riped it off and just tape the other part to foot,1

7401,Doesn't work well with other products . Even if they're Lotta Body products. Shipped fast though,3

7403,I think it will work very well; delivery service was excellent,4
7404,This is awesome product for very dry skin! Smoother on the skin than the shea butter. Great on my dry bald head!,4

seemed to have no power at all.",2
7407,this one is not working......i use one time and threw into trash bag... it NEVER WORKS Do not waste your money,1
7408,Seems to be nice quality--it just arrived. But I was disappointed to learn it's made in China. Removing a barcode sticker revealed this.,4
7409,"This is a wonderful moisturizer.  It is quite ""greasy"" kind of like Vaseline.",5
7410,I was surprised the blades were available. There is always a chance things don't fit and these had no trouble!,4

7412,Starts to rot from moisture in bathroom and grows mold.,1
7413,Terrible product. My hair got tangled every time I used it. Complete misrepresentation!,1
7414,I found Philips Norelco 8240 somewhat irritating unless I used a good creamy shaving lotion.  That is my recommendation for this product.,3
7415,I've been using this for about two weeks. I don't see any difference yet and i'm not that found of the foam.,4
7416,It's just a comb Does the job. Can't find good hard rubber Ace combs anymore. Sturdy and doesn't irritate scalp.,5
7417,Have  used this for years  works great  around  your face. Great for short  hair.,4
7418,Easy to use too much and have greasy hair.  Not really better than less costly oil-based products.,3

7428,I love this! Real Vitamin C that really helps your Skin improve and is anti-aging.,5
7429,This stick rubs in easily and protects well against everyday contact with the rays. I like how it doesn't leave any smell or oily residue.,5
7430,Wears off very fast if you are sweating. It just doesnt hold up for Oder protection.,2
7431,"Only received 9lbs of black soap, nevertheless, I am happy with the product received. Would like that extra lb though",3
7432,good thing it had a small plastic covering on the lid because that is what dried and kept the rest of it from completely drying out.,4

7448,Can't style my hair without this wonderful hot air brush...,5
7449,Dope. But like any stocking cap stretches out after a few uses...,4

7456,Can anyone tell me were you can still find the old formula Badedas? This new formula is nothing like the old one.,2
7457,these are nice but a little too large for your nails,1
7458,Works as advertised! love that it is water proof. Previously used Braun and am happy I switched. Would buy again,4

7462,Comb was not the length that was stated in on-line info.,3
7463,"OK, but does NOT beat flossing with flossing string.",3

7472,Smelly.  Made my scalp break out.  Only really lasted 2 washes.,1
7473,"they are exactly what I expected, plenty of each color in case I lose some.",1
7474,Mild moisturizer is light and clear.  The cleanser is nice with a light scrub folded into the cream.  Not bad at all.,4

7634,This is a really great product at a great price. You can't get much better than a Philips. Hands down the best out there.,5
7635,"This stuff really works, my mare had pretty bad scratches, and this lotion got rid of all of them.  Love this product",5
7636,Still using it. waiting on results. month and half in,3
7637,"first time the mirror hit the ground the handle broke in two.  cheaply made, but it reflects so cant complain too much right?",2
7638,"a little dry and cannot last very long time
but color is good",4
7639,Turns out not to have any apricot oil in it at all! Does work nicely but I was looking for apricot oil.,3
7640,The quality and the design is very good and it looks like the picture. And the price was good too,4
7641,Works well for me. It is a good size for home use.,4
7642,"Arrived super quick, but the scarf is much smaller than I expected.",3
7643,This cover is flimsy and will very easily dislodge itself from your ipod just by being placed in a coat pocket.,2
7644,"Wanted to try a heated eyelash curler, but this one does not do the job.  Back to normal everyday eye curler.",2
7645,Looks nothing like the picture. Shapless & tacky looking. Wouldnt wear it on Halloween...if I wore costumes on that day.,1
7646,It's a great product for the price I will be buying these again!!,5
7647,"The color seemes ""off"" than when I bought this shade before.  I was kind of disappointed.",3
7648,Works OK as a replacement for original Braun Shaver brush. I could easily find a more identical replacement at a reasonable price.,4
7649,"the applicator is wonderful, but the product consistency is somewhat sticky. the color is a bit ""warmer"" than I expected.",4
7650,Love the way it smells and makes my skin feel. Good for a birthday gift or valentine's day ,4
7651,After 2.5 years (not daily use) the button is sticking--the one you use for the flow of the water.,3
7652,This actually dies work! I had this huge zyst on my chin & this dried it overnight. Happy customer!,5
7653,"Served no purpose, they cut off my circulation, they were uncomfortable go figure. Not impressed. I wouldn't waste my money.",1
7654,Stand is good looking and very sturdy. Looks like it will last.,4
7655,It performs as well as any Norelco I have owned over the last 40 years.  I would recommend to anyone.,4
7656,"perfect for my skin tone, nice pigmentation, but i a little drying and has a chalky texture",3
7657,Lasted only a week and then faded after 2 washes. Which went to a green color.,2
7658,Liquid monomer was dried up. They refunded but wouldn't replace the item.,1
7659,The brushes de okay but they brake easily after a while .,2
7660,Easy to use and hopeful it will do the trick in getting the teeth cleaner but I do  like the way it works,5
7661,Thanks for my order  I was hoping for the colors that you have in the picture but ok.,1
7662,"I love it so much, others receive it on their birthday.  Now they love it too.",5
7663,I have no complaints about this product.  It works very well as expected.  Two heads make it easy to share.,4
7664,heres where the money leave you make you own . go online and read ..you can use many different things to make your own,1
7665,"These are the best razor blades on the market, in my opinion.  They shave much more smoothly than stainless steel blades.",5
7666,"When it's in your mouth...not so bad, but the taste that lingers afterwards will have you dreading the next morning's use.",2
7667,Made blades do not feel coated in any way. Do cause irritation no matter if you use pre shave oil and shave cream or not.,3
7668,good no issues so far. makes little sound but that's fine. I suggest this product. worth for money. I rate 4 for this,4
7669,Do not buy unless you like to shave with a sharpened rake. Bic should review their manufacturer of this model!!,1
7670,BEWARE!!!! SCAM!!!!!!!!!,1
7671,I hope it's going to work if it don't work can't return it !!!!,5
7672,I really like this small convenience  size cococare stick. Recommended for any one who just want to moisturize there skin when needed.,4
7673,"My nails are in horrible shape, I had to stop using this stuff. They were breaking and chipping......bad bad bad!!!",1
7674,"mine easily broke when I dropped it - before that, not very impressed with its performance either - good ol' small electric clippers seem better",2
7675,Band was itchy but the feather was nice. I cut the feather off the band and used it separately for my 1920' outfit.,2
7676,Not sure if it works long term but I can see a difference when I take it off in the morning and it feels ok to sleep with!,4
7677,I have not been able to figure out how to use this item. They are too long and bulky. They are useless.,1
7678,It's nice it just doesn't work as powerful as I would like,3
7679,"a little thick. works nicely with a gloss over the top. nice nude. not pink or peach, just medium tan.",4
7680,Love them. This is my 3rd purchase. Very comfortable.,4
7681,"Great color, great product. My makeup must have!",5
7682,"Exactly what I wanted.  I hope you keep selling this product,  it work's good for me.",4
7683,This product is thicker than the original one I bought.  Not sure why but it does not apply as easily and I am not using it.,1
7684,"Smells like roses, but not overwhelmingly so. Nice lotion.",5
7685,Nice addition to the services I provide in my barber shop. Great product and shipped quick.,5
7686,It's the cutting heads only but they work great. If you need the floating head also that is another part,5
7687,I don't get what the fuss is about. I don't like it!,2
7688,Smells pretty good. My children use it and it's worked pretty good on their crazy wavy hair. Nice knowing there are no harsh chemicals!,4
7689,If u are looking for aiming that is good right here I would get it again I love the is,5
7690,"Its ok. Quality not great.
Careful. Its only 110 v.",3
7691,"I have sensitive skin and allergies, but this product is gentle and effective for the bikini line. I highly recommend it.",5
7692,This product didn't cover my tattoo like it said it would and the shade is all wrong . Never ordering again,1
7693,Works wonders on teeth and gums. Price was right. Only thing wrong is it could use a larger water tank and little longer hose.,4
7694,Good size for a good grip.  Works as it is supposed to and clean up is easy.  This should last a very long time.,5
7695,This is a high quality product that is presented well and protected in nice packaging that makes it obvious that someone takes great pride in their product.,5
7696,"One of the best razors I've ever used.
Closest and smoothest shave ever-

My legs love this razor, thank you!!",5
7697,"I love it
 Clean fresh smell, non irritating to my scalp..",5
7698,"I haven't been using this for very long,  But I seem to like it.",4
7699,Does what expected. Fits my Muhle R89 Safety razor and Parker Silvertip Badger Bristle Shaving Brush perfectly.,5
7700,"This product has a pleasant smell and works fine but I probably won't repurchase due to the price. Regular moisturizer does fine, or coconut oil.",4
7701,Loved the two bottles ordered from the Fresh website nut there is something lacking about this one. Will go back to Fresh next time.,2
7702,"Close shave,easy to handle and clean.

Lightweight is good for travel and charger can stay home for normal business trips.",4
7703,Some of the jewels are not glued properly.. I don't envision it lasting very long.,2
7704,Brush is not good but other than that a great kit,5
7705,The veil is cute but not three meters as expected and should have better finish seam lace with tulle veil.,2
7706,Works quite well. I hope it works better than the Spectragel.  I've said all I want to say.  Good bye,4
7707,"Doesn't vacuum up all the hair, but makes the overall cleaner process.  Fits well in hand.  Cuts well. Simple to use.",4
7708,Very nice blades. Great shave. Great price!!! Makes shaving more enjoyable.,5
7709,"Meh, works okay for small areas but if you have three dogs... well, not very effective.",3
7710,"Great vendor, item arrived quickly exactly as described.  I love this calendar because I can insert photos of the grandkids for the cover",5
7711,"Fair & white lait corps gave me a lot of pimples, rashes on my skin. Am highly dissapointed and i will not buy it again.",1
7712,Glitter is just as expected. Took a while to get it though. I haven't used it yet but I'm sure it's fine.,4
7713,Well you need something to get you hair on edge.,5
7714,Paint peals within a day or two.  We have a UV professional light and the paint peels off almost immediately.,1
7715,"This product does what it's supposed to do, I use it to trim my moustache, goatee and sideburns, ear/nose hairs!",4
7716,I used this 3 times.  Never touched a drop of water. Now it doesn't work. What a waste!,1
7717,Thought it was bigger. It's very very small.,1
7718,"These blades are very sharp, however, I have sensitive skin and they gave me a ton of nicks.",3
7719,I just got the du rag yesterday and quality is so bad threading already spilted in the middle,1
7720,Great product... just what I wanted.  Works great and very stylish.,5
7721,"Did not like the strong alcohol smell but it worked well with dandruff, hair breakage and dullness. My hair looked a lot healthier on the product...",3
7722,"Love this bodywash and bought these consistently while I was deployed to Afghanistan.  However, not that I'm back, Target and Walmart are cheaper",4
7723,Great for my make up I do.....I love crazy make up and it's great for zombie looks and tears  yay,5
7724,Did not lighten my medium dark hair. A few grays remained.,3
7725,Ok I can't get the curl I want with it,2
7726,"i have been using this norelco shaver for the last month and its great ,alot quieter ,easy to clean,and i hardley ever charge it.",4
7727,Colors are a little darker than I expected but I like them.,4
7728,This was a gift and they didn't have anything bad to say about the product.,4
7729,this is a very pretty bracelet and the turquoise color is lovely but it is very difficult to put on----had to have help,3
7730,Like everybody else mention it it does make your lashes look thicker but there is a lot of little flakes that fall off,3
7731,I saw the mixed reviews before purchase but bought the product anyway. Nothing wrong with mine. Would purchase again.,5
7732,I received about ten and they were so small i had a problem loosing them in my sleep.,2
7733,"Nice shaver, but there's no warning of ""low battery.""  It just dies.  Recharge it and you're good to go.",4
7734,Pretty but chain was broken.  I reordered it and the stone fell out.  Waste of money,2
7735,I love this stuff.  It was a great price!,4
7736,Had stuff in it that could cause cancer we returned it.,1
7737,Sets up the skin very well. The smell is not as offensive as other lubricants.,4
7738,"Helped me clean. I have been using for 2 years now, no problem at all.",5
7739,The control on the handle would stick and within two weeks it stuck closed.  This is one more cheaply made product.,1
7740,I purchased this to help with the deep pockets on my gumline and since using this it has made a difference and the pockets have gotten smaller.,4
7741,"Product was sturdy and well made. It would not fit my cabinet, so it was returned.",3
7742,This left a grimy residue on my skin. I don't recommend it.,1
7743,This is NOT mehron and not safe to use on skin. I am furious,1
7744,i love it so much they are so soft and do everything i want them to do :),4
7745,"After using the razor for many years, the new blades made it as good as new.",4
7746,"excellent system! the closest smoothest shaves i've ever had, with little irritation because of the conditioner.
highly recommended",5
7747,Very pretty and shiny!! Ordered it on the 18th and received it today 12/31/14 so it came a lot quicker than expected.. Looks just like the picture,4
7748,mine broke the first time I wore it.  Get what you paid for.  Cute,2
7749,This is so much nicer than the old type waterpik. It is more hygenic and easier to set up and looks so much better.,4
7750,Best razor I've ever owned!  I didn't know it was possible to get this kind of shave without using a blade--highly recommended product!,5
7751,This product is a very good buy and it works great.  I am very pleased with this purchase.,4
7752,Looks good. Wish it had a little more lining and a little bigger. Lots of color.,4
7753,Product did not have a size in description and was the wrong size when I received it. It is a one size fits most. 42-52.,1
7754,I went back to a razor - not the best shave,2
7755,it's not blue point. feels very cheap and the telescoping is so loose it keeps turning. you get what you pay for.,3
7756,"I did not see any result, what a waste of money....",1
7757,completely functional cape for home haircutting and any other home haircare.,4
7758,"My lady likes,  not expensive for me to get a few at a boys",5
7759,"Cheap and not worth it. I would not recommend. Item does not come in packaging, just a plastic postage bag.",1
7760,"Love this , a 1970's throwback product. Very refreshing!",4
7761,I used the entire bottle in conjunction with the OZ moisturizer and didn't notice any change.,2
7762,awfull. plastic metal painted with a lot of bubbles.,1
7763,It arrived broken and what was still in tact was an extremely extremely cheap material. Not impressed.,1
7764,"These were way too small. Besides that, they looked great. If you're looking for small and good quality I would suggest these.",3
7765,I tried  them on and just  fell in love with  them,5
7766,Works good for me. Not too hard nor soft.,4
7767,Comb was not the length that was stated in on-line info.,3
7768,"These are overpriced for the quality, it feels like it is made out of very cheap parts would not buy again",2
7769,Good product. I like the lavender smell. Seems to be gentle enough for my sensitive skin.,4
7770,Great and good looking mask. I bought it for my daughter's 15 waltz dance and they boys rock it.,5
7771,Works good for a face mask...haven't  tried it on the body yet. The item was exactly the way it was described...,4
7772,had to reorder as my oldest granddaughter saw it and took it. lol. good stuff! well worth the value.,5
7773,My skin instantly felt softI love how my skin feels every single day after using this product,4
7774,Helps to keep my skin moisturized. I like that it is a cream instead of lotion.,4
7775,Always used Wilkinson blades . These are good for my beard but found better,3
7776,"Great Color.  I am using Essie TLC Colors now, and it is improving my nails beyond my belief.",4
7777,"Good product and helps with your dental hygiene  If used on a regular basis, it has ti help with your dental visit and bill.",5
7778,"Use this everyday, the only things I can say on the nagative side is that it's just a little bulky",4
7779,Great smelling soap for men not over powering and good lather,5
7780,It is easy to use. I think my teeth change color when I use it 3 times.,4
7781,"My wife uses this for her support hose, she uses it all the time.",4
7782,"I ordered the plastic, quick-release buckle.  I received the metal buckle instead. I cannot use it.  A waste of money.",2
7783,"Pretty good product for the price.  My brush fits perfect however, my razor does not fit at all...  I use the Pro Glide series.",4
7784,"Too small, nothing to do with the picture and doesnt't fit the head.",1
7785,The pen doesn't like to stay in the cap.,2
7786,Wax doesn't get as hot and thin as it should which makes it harder to use,3
7787,It really does a nice job holding my stuff up.,5
7788,"NO attachments stand. priced higher than targets. they have the stand, also. should have gone to target, for a good one.",3
7789,"It looked really good, but you have to bend it to fit your finger, and it wasn't long before it broke in half.",2
7790,Not what I thought cheaply made and tore on me the first I used it and the part about thin socks try paper think socks maybe,1
7791,Stupid. Peeled off within a few yards of walking.,1
7792,Pulls out hair that easily gets caught between the bristle barrel and the handle joint. Ouch.,3
7793,Very nice cream. I use it for my neck.  It has a decent not overpowering smell and a nice fast soaking into skin consistency.,4
7794,"I like this! The wax is a bit difficult to work with, but it works. Clorox wipes are great for cleanup!",4
7795,Waste of money.  They lose elasticity and it's form after one use.,1
7796,"This eye cream has been a longtime staple for me, but can't be found in stores anymore... It's creamy and hydrates my under-eye area.",4
7797,love this. easy to carry on the boat and works great.,5
7798,"It works amazing, fantastic, never used something like this before I highly recommend this product I will keep using it",5
7799,Loved the products however did think it was priced a little high wanted to get the lotion but the price with shipping and handling was way too much!,5
7800,Works great.  Actually returned this one and bought the same thing along with a small travel sized unit for about $10 less at Costco.,5
7801,These are tiny.  Too small to work.  I expected something bigger.  Please put actual dimensions in your listings rather than the size of the box.,1
7802,Tried it once when I ran out of Abreva. It worked OK but not nearly as quickly or good as Abreva. It's alot cheaper though.,3
7803,Been using this for a couple weeks now and no results.  My lashes aren't growing.,3
7804,"Not quite as powerful as the older models, but the extra attachments make it a good value. Resevoir could be bigger",4
7805,"Hello

Very beautiful
And work well
The color is also beautiful
My sister and I love it
I love it",3
7806,Did not experience the growth in length or girth as promised.,1
7807,The tiara we ordered was beautiful. Well priced and my daughter loves it.,4
7808,"Let's just say, every home should have one. If you're going away, make room for this bad boy in your suitcase :)",5
7809,Way too small.. Would even be small on a child's ear.,1
7810,i literally hate it. Doesnt stick well at all. Makes your face look gross and also makes your wig slide off. No.,1
7811,It works as well as the more expensive disposible razors. I purchased it because I was spending too much on disposable razors.,4
7812,You cant beat it 250 blades for price they work great i add nivea cream on face and shave face is nice smooth,4
7813,"This is a nice hair cover, but it is starting to stretch out already. It is very long also.",4
7814,It helps my really dry skin and there is no unpleasant smell.,4
7815,This time we two.  The first one lasted about 4 years.,4
7816,a little different than the original part but seems to work just fine.,4
7817,this is at par with burs bee lip balm... but people who have already used Nivea might not like it.. as Nivea stays for longer time,3
7818,I get all the babes with this. Actually smells great and hard to find in stores.,5
7819,Bad! Never used a cleanser deemed gentle and had a red face for 2 hours! Do not buy! I am a skin therapist!,1
7820,"Love the soft,easy to use, brushes! I would recomend  these brushes to you!",5
7821,super tiny so its hard to work without a dispenser but great for detailed lines,3
7822,It does not look as natural it is just paint the skin and thats it. The gray is still there,2
7823,My wife inially had difficulty finding replacement disks but Neutrogena followed through with additional information & a 2 month supply of the diskd free. Great customer service.,4
7824,"It`s ok, nothing too fancy. A little too hard.",2
7825,"Helps to set makeup, but not as well as others I've tried.",3
7826,Loved how they came. Took a little long to get to me and it has a smell of paint but besides that i love the brushes.,4
7827,The contents of the bottles were spilled all over the place and when I tried to plug in the warmer it does NOT WORK!!!,1
7828,It does not shave nearly as clean as older models I have. I am disappointed.,1
7829,"Not over powering aroma, Subtle, There is just something about Aqua Velva,,, man",4
7830,"Different look from picture,this lip color is so dark,when applied it looks like black lip gloss.",3
7831,Don't work smells like something an old lady would use,1
7832,I have used the Banana Boat product will late 80's and pound for pound best product on the market.  Use it over chapstick any day!,5
7833,It does a good job and not hard to use. I may have liked it better if the arm was not attached.,4
7834,"This is a new formulation and it's terrible. Drying and does not lather.

Please bring back the original formula that was great and very moisturizing.",1
7835,This product you get what you pay for.  Very course brushes which don't hold any product on them to use.,1
7836,"Got it under a special deal from slickdeals. Worth the money. Will buy again.
Compared to new temp ones this is good.",4
7837,"This is the best Waterpik.  Small, doesn't take up too much room, is very powerful and works great.",5
7838,Lessens the irritation immensely. I've never felt this good after shaving my bikini area.,5
7839,I love this color trio as it looks good with my eye color (blue) but would look pretty on brunettes as well.  Very neutral colors.,5
7840,"Our family uses it for dandruff and pimples. It works from the first time and quickly.
Good and natural product",4
7841,Great product. Prompt delivery. I'm waiting to see the results in my yard.,4
7842,Ordered this item and it states pack of 4... when it arrived it was a single retailer... would not order again,1
7843,It's so so I will use but not buy again,3
7844,Was broken when I opened my package. Cheap cheap and it would have been cute but it was broken. ..,1
7845,"They are made kinda cheap, but you definitely can't complain for $1.75 with free shipping!",3
7846,Great product but not cheap considering it elaborates from the machine very quickly.,3
7847,This battery was the exact battery need and works great.,5
7848,"I appreciate the ""greenness"" of this soap but it barely smells of chamomile.",3
7849,Decent product until I dropped on the floor and broke the razor part.,4
7850,Leaves a clean feeling but not sure if it actually works,4
7851,Really a good tool. Easy to use safely. Wish it was waterproof.,4
7852,waiting for spring to use around flower beds to ward off ants and slugs will let you know how it performs,4
7853,"Thankfully, I got a real one. It's very thick in consistency and blends well. I'm excited to wear it out!",4
7854,i have had no problems so far. I have used it once and it worked fine. It was a brand new piece too.,5
7855,Did not work for me. Perhaps my hair was not the right texture though,1
7856,We have used a waterpik for years. This one leaks and makes a mess of the bathroom counter.,1
7857,"The bottles work very well, but they did not send frosted bottles which is what I thought I would get.  The bottles were clear.",3
7858,"I can tell I like the gems but I have yet to be able to open them, it is so hard!!",4
7859,Worthless. More trouble to send it back than worth of my time.,1
7860,This is my second tub and I love it. Every once in a while I get blemishes and it clears it right up!!,5
7861,"I will stick with ""truly's"" for kids. We used this once or twice, but we were still smelling body odor after using it.",2
7862,So much better than regular floss.  Never shreds in your teeth!,5
7863,comfortable. I was hoping for a bit more firmness but they do work great,4
7864,Compact and more quiet than the earlier model Waterpik this one replaced.  Wand hose storage is also a plus.  Would recommend.,4
7865,Not for pale skin unless you want to look like a corpse.,1
7866,They must be good because Dr. Tooth told me I really do an excellent of brushing...must be those Oral B's!,5
7867,NO. No smell. Makes a mess on white wash rags. Does not last.,1
7868,Died after a year of use. Won't charge. Threw it away. Was great while it lasted.,2
7869,not very comfortable to wear.  the cups are so shallow they rest on my eye lids,2
7870,Maggies are my favorite socks. I have many pairs and styles,5
7871,"not at once, at least. it will leave your skin looking super greasy/sticky.",4
7872,I expected to be able to remove the entire brush but only the bristles come off. A core stays attached.,3
7873,Great dental reports for many years after purchase.  Original lasted about five years of daily use even travel on vacation.  No complaints at all.,4
7874,They are a good quaility blades. Would recommend to friends and family. Would diffently order more in future orders. Good close shaves.,4
7875,Leaves my hair with lustre and body. Easy to use. No wasteful container. Highly recommended.,5
7876,I love this stuff. Only thing I'm not allergic to.,5
7877,"My girlfriend loves these! 5 stars, fast shipping, great price.",5
7878,Awful. Product arrived with glue on the outside of the bottle. Very gummy.,1
7879,Heats up very slowly. I'm not sure that it actually heats up enough to impact hair...,1
7880,Decent cut but takes several passes to get a close cut.  On average it takes 15+ minutes to get a decent shave.  Much too expensive.,3
7881,Its a very large size you won't find in retail stores.,5
7882,Love this cream for keeping my skin moist and also love the smell.  It is light and works well with additional creams.,5
7883,"Nice clean and attractive aroma. Only four stars because I like my ""Blue"" Spice a little more.",4
7884,It worked like a charm and that is saying a lot because my hair is thick.,4
7885,"My face gets that tingly feeling whenever I use this toner. I really like this product, so refreshing to use in the morning.",4
7886,This product is Little heavy but still Looks good . Has nice grip and good quality also. One can surely buy,4
7887,No roses here. Shouldn't have bit at such a low price.,1
7888,"I like the way this operates, easy to use, I have gum issues and this has improve my dential hygiene visit to the my doctors.",4
7889,"It's great plenty of pressure ,  but unfortunately does not come with a lounge scraper like pictured instead you get two regular pics.",4
7890,was exactly what i anticpated it is like getting teeth cleaned at the dentist only alot more comfortable def recomend,4
7891,"Paste does work nearly as well as gel. Also, paste is a blue color and leaves it all over your teeth.",2
7892,I love the color. It did make my lips look dry though.,4
7893,"Not nearly as ""slip resistant"" as advertised.  Made my shoes worse,  more slippery than before these were attached to the bottoms.",1
7894,BUYER BEWARE people may confuse you for a delicious almond cookie!,5
7895,"They work great! Except the liquid smells so bad ! It was my first time, I think I did a good job.",4
7896,I would recommend flat white or black for beginner.  These metallic is not easy and wouldn't stand out if you use it with nail stamping.,3
7897,"Nice and sharp, well packaged. makes for a good shave, great value for the money. Far cheaper then multiple blade replacement blade cartridges.",4
7898,My favorite face wash. I wish it wasn't so expense,5
7899,Made my hair ratty and gave it away...awful product awful customer service,1
7900,"Will use this on vacation, and in hair drying stand after my rotator cuff repair surgery later this month",4
7901,Not sure that this product is better than the old fashioned eyelash curlers.,4
7902,For the price it's a good deal...super small... Almost nose stud size.,3
7903,"This wig is indeed small for adults. It did the job for a one time use, but be warned it really is small.",3
7904,I like the product but when i recived it it was leaking all over the package.,3
7905,"I've used this product for years.  It says what it does and does what it says.  It isn't a miracle, but what is?",5
7906,"I ordered a pack of two but only received one.
Works well, but it stinks it's not waterproof.",2
7907,"haven't tried them yet, but I guess I better so look at each one to also see if they are ok.",4
7908,Works great! Quickly became part of my nightly routine. Love the way my skin feels!,5
7909,Instructions say it lasts for 3 months under normal usage. Mine got finished in less than 30 days!!!,3
7910,"It works for a few hours, then you have to re-apply",3
7911,"Good except the mustache trimmer requires changing the head blade, which can be inconvenient.",3
7912,"I would have loved to try it, but it doesn't work. Put new batteries in it. Still wouldn't turn on.",1
7913,"Terrific ...... easy to trim brush to 1/4 so hair doesn't tangle, especially if hair is fine and long",5
7914,"Thus far, no problems whatsoever. The battery holds a charge f0r many days and the shave is smooth No complaints...

t",4
7915,Smells like chemicals . Very unnatural . I bought 4 and they all smelled like poison and a little almond,1
7916,"My son had an allergic reaction to this product and broke out in a raw, red rash. The rash went away when we stopped using this.",1
7917,I just use it on lip and it's okay.,4
7918,Exactly as pictured. Works great. I have had no problem with the. metal. It does not irritate skin,5
7919,Product works great.  If needed would buy it again. Would advise others to buy it. Thank you for your product.,5
7920,"Nice product, fits most razor and brush combos, wish I could get it in stainless steel.  Otherwise 5 star",4
7921,I swear these containers are getting smaller and smaller?!,4
7922,The oil leaks out of the bottle BEWARE! Never used for anything but a night foot massage. Husband loved the oils on his hard working feet.,3
7923,Love this. It glides on and blends in easily. I won't be without it in my makeup drawer.,5
7924,These were some generic brand and not real Goody brand spin pins.  Worked fine but not as advertised in description.,2
7925,We are pleased to receive this product and it has extended the life of the expensive shaver.,4
7926,"Great product! I personally would like a little less scent, even though its wonderful, just a little too pungent for my use.",4
7927,It has artificial dyes in the product. The black dye will stain your clothes. Just stick with Murrays,1
7928,"works as long as you use the product daily, and the product lasts along time you only need a small amount at each use",5
7929,I actually does make my lashes look fuller and thicker. Just use it lightly. One coat is enough or it will clump.,5
7930,Durable well constructed and efficient for use in the shower to clean toe nails.  Well made.  The price is right.  Highly recommended!,5
7931,Came faster than what I expected no duplicates. Love the colors and the way they fit,5
7932,As advertised. Works great and fits my new DE razor and brush.,5
7933,It was great to give my 3 year old some fun options for eye patches. They look good and fit well.,4
7934,"Good performance, good price.  Styling is a bit tired - maybe using their molds from the 50s keeps the price low ;o)",4
7935,Ok product. It didn't feel harsh but my face was red for a while after using for the 1st time. Use randomly.,3
7936,"It's a 5 star item, just SO large!!  It will last me the rest of my life!!",4
7937,Looks like product show but is so cheaply put together it had super glue all over the outside of the pendent !Disappointed,1
7938,its very good to get this product with the green tea ingredients will be so nice to my face thanks,4
7939,"No way to return , it was the wrong size,would have been happy with it,if I could have got a bigger size",1
7940,These did not work as I had hoped.  Not for my grooming routine,2
7941,Do not buy!!! Bobbi brown makeup came and it was cracked. Returned automatically,1
7942,"I bought this as a birthday gift for my brother and he loves it. It's quite and effective, also good for your money.",5
7943,"large bottle for a good price, and it smells great. only small complaint is the fragrance doesn't linger very long.",4
7944,"A good shave, a little to aggressive for the thickness.of my facial hair. If you have normal not so thick facial i bet these are a dream",4
7945,I've only been using it a short while but I've noticed a marked improvement in my skin tone and my dark spots/scars are definitely fading.,4
7946,good shave. have owned several braun shavers. bought 1 for my dad and also for my brother in law as gifts,5
7947,Love this brush hair dryer.  Easy to use and does wonders for my naturally wavy hair.,5
7948,Great quality  cimb period. You'll  feel  the difference.,4
7949,Don't waste your money . Tried it once & yuck .. my hair felt stiff and sticky . Never again .,1
7950,These pink brushes are so cute I love them I wish they had brushes f,4
7951,Hopefully it is the same that I used to order 3 yrs ago,3
7952,The product was alright smelled good but it irritated my skin a bit. I'm guessing it was the fragrance.,3
7953,Very easy to apply! Keeps hands from getting all buttery like normal sunscreen.,3
7954,Excellent product.  But bottle is large and not easy to hold while showering  Should come with a pump,4
7955,I have had to put in 4 new ones just since I got the package because all of the diamonds keep falling out.,1
7956,"Will return, wanted the next size bigger I use to wear in my teens. OW good barrette",3
7957,"I thought this was going to be nice makeup, way way too thick!",1
7958,This item broke shortly after purchasing......my first one lasted longer but still broke. Way to expensive to break so easily,2
7959,The product that I received were damaged. At least 5 colors were cracked.,1
7960,This seems great to begin with but not really made to last.  Needs to be a better fabric.  A nicer fabric would be better.,3
7961,"Especially if you are afraid of periodontal disease, you should get this.  It is a pleasant massage for the gums and does help to improve pockets.",5
7962,Terrible. The liquid monomer wasn't even liquid! Worst product ever.,1
7963,Lid storage is cumbersome and a PITA.  It doesn't hold all the tips that come with.  Love the performance though,4
7964,Good pressure settings and design. Like storage feature and rotating spray nozzle. Would have liked a larger reservoir and longer tube feeding nozzle.,3
7965,"I am using this product for some time, but don't see any improvements.",1
7966,"Great product, however I found some in Wal-Mart even cheaper. My next purchase will come from Wal-Mart.",4
7967,"These are the best!  Super smooth, very sharp but not too aggressive.  Always a great shave.",5
7968,"While it smells great, I cannot confirm that it is working for me.  Need to do more tests during the next few weeks.",4
7969,"Only one glows in the dark and it's the light green one. However, it doesn't chip my teeth so I like it.",5
7970,Does not look like a real dog tag. Is super lumpy and a weird texture. Returned,2
7971,Nice for a casual hairdo.  Price is right but it was not quite large enough for me to triple it and too loose with a double loop.,2
7972,Not as elegant as I imagined.  The colors are more orange than I could see.  The powder is cheap and dirty looking on my face.,2
7973,Reminiscent of my grandmother. I just adore this scent.,5
7974,These are okay. I had used another brand but cannot remember the name of them that i really liked but these are okay!,3
7975,"I bought two, One has  the validity period, the other doesn't have.",3
7976,I love the smell! This is our favorite lotion!,5
7977,"This glycerin is very good, I cook with it ,...and make hair products for my Household..... I have no complaints!!!",5
7978,Claps have excess plastic inside which can get caught in curly hair.,4
7979,"Its like my old one It works just fine, I am use to the performance.",4
7980,The fabric did not feel like real satin but something like it. but I miss the feel of real satin to protect hairdo.,3
7981,"Did not moisturize my lips, product sat on top of lips but did not sink in. No bueno.",1
7982,This dental floos also breaks when trying to clean your teeth. Bought it because was recommended by my dentist. But didn't work as recommended.,3
7983,This is the only toothpaste we use. Our teeth are sqeeky clean after brushing.,5
7984,This is lovely. My Book Of Shadow fits perfectly in it. Thank you and Blessed Be!,4
7985,This was a great product and came fast. Worked great and exactly how I wanted it. Very Happy :),5
7986,Great product. These are such pretty and soft makeup brushes. i really like them This is as described in the description.,4
7987,"I don't generally like these but, it works with some side effects.",5
7988,"I received my order on time, and the products were not broken which I was afraid of.....the smell is heavenly Caress body washes never fail",4
7989,Been using this product for years. Gives a close shave and works well.,4
7990,"Tag is ""ok"" the necklace is much shorter than they advertise.",2
7991,the product was new and the correct item for the razor i wanted it for.  Also the packaging was original.  Not some fit all..,4
7992,"This cream works well - moisturizing and a great barrier cream.  It is a little greasy though.  It stays on well, even after handwashing.",4
7993,They are super cute but the clips suck I ended up taking them off the clip and putting them on a headband,3
7994,"Not what I like to wear, but it looks great on and for a different look I recommend it. Good price too.",4
7995,I was not particularly impressed with the sharpness of these blades but they did give new life to my clippers.,3
7996,"Just okay. I already had two of the stones fall out before even wearing. You get what you pay for, folks.",3
7997,"Yes, it is as described. I like it.",4
7998,"Sorry just wasted my money.. the brushes won't even hold my make up.. too soft and I try washing it, but only got worst.",1
7999,This stuff makes my skin feel so smooth and it lasts forever!,5
8000,What's the point?  It burns but doesn't stop bleeding.,2
8001,"i have hard beard, for trimming hard/thick beard is not good, suggest me something better than this and cheap product.",2
8002,"This toothbrush was a great gift for a teenager,  she loves it.  she mentioned how great it will be to take to summer camp this year.",5
8003,"Seemed big at first, but it grew on me after a while.",4
8004,"I think this works great, good pressure. I just wish i didn't have to fill the water tank so often.",4
8005,One package of floss had no floss so I paid for six and received five. ,1
8006,Great product.  Nice and clean finish. well balanced stand.  Well worth the money!!!,5
8007,I wish the instructions were clearer on how to use the product! The instructions do not really explain it...I am still trying to figure it out,1
8008,The description said Pearl but that's not what i received. Disappointed.,3
8009,"when i got the package the shampoo bottle was leaking and the pump doesn't work.
very dissapoined and had to replace with other pump",1
8010,"No nicks and cuts. Shave quality could be better, but considering price point value and overall quality I give it 5 stars.",5
8011,"A sleek and handsome design that is well weighted so it does not tip over, non-slip bottom and solid construction overall. Delivered when promised.",5
8012,The lady who received this gift said it was not as fragrant as she would have preferred.  Fragrance was too light in her opinion.,3
8013,Looks good but the chain is a little too short for my liking.,3
8014,"Better than most, but I've definitely had cheaper products that work as well. Has the typical odor of Aveda",4
8015,Nice vibrant colors. I find they don't snap close easily.,4
8016,Amazing deal. The price of this item for this size is really great! Aquaphor serves many purposes. Enjoy!!,5
8017,like omg here love it their a lot got them to day and happy with the striping i got thank you,5
8018,"wrong Item, I was ordering the capsules so I thought. If I can return this I will.thank You. I did not use this product.",1
8019,They are what I expected and you can not beat the price.,4
8020,"It does the job, until I drop the darn thing and have to buy again!",4
8021,The toothbrush definitely does the job but I find myself needing to replace it more frequently than I would have expected.,4
8022,Haven't really noticed a significant difference in growth or health of hair.,2
8023,Awesome stuff. I bought another bottle. It last awhile,5
8024,Cheap and turned color after 2 wears.  Worth $1 not $7.99,1
8025,Great. Improved my oral health from one visit to the next. Gets better as your health gets better.  Try it.,5
8026,Wife only like 2 out of the 5 smells... but still have fun with them.,4
8027,Had looked everywhere for what we needed and this is exactly it!!!! Perfect Fit to protect our Christmas present to each other :),5
8028,Well made and very smooth. Great selection of sizes.,4
8029,It works if you use it.  Still think a bit of regular flossing might help.,5
8030,"My daughter LOVED IT , REALLY PRETTY COLORS , HOPE IT LADTS LONGER THAN THE SAME BRACELET ( DIFFERENT
STYLE ) THAT I RECEIVED LADT WEEK !",4
8031,Two nights and already the leds don't work do not buy this turd,1
8032,"Horrible quality, wore for 10 seconds and clasp broke!",1
8033,Good product which should be improved by the manufacturer to provide a better grip.,4
8034,Didn't work my child still ended up with headlice and we sprayed it on every morning I'm very disappointed after reading all the great reviews,2
8035,Very cute easy to use but I was expecting 5 not 1 I also would of like to chose the color and shape,4
8036,love this stuff!! My only complaint is it really does NOT cover the gray around the temples and front of face.,5
8037,I love this cleansing cream. I also bought the body cream. Love the smell.,5
8038,It works great!  I especially like it because it releases my hair easily - no getting tangled!,4
8039,Quality of tightened strap isn't that great. I wasn't impressed.,2
8040,"We bought this for our son who recently got braces, and it works great for him.  Now everyone uses it!",4
8041,It disn't work well for me and my hair felt weighed down.,1
8042,"Smells good.  Smooth, clean scent.  Not sure if I will buy it again but it is a decent powder.",4
8043,"Beautifully designed, easy to handle BUT power is severely lacking.  Would take an hour to actually dry even slightly damp short hair with this device.",3
8044,"This was the third one of these that I have bought from them.  1 at home, 1 at work and now this one for my son.",5
8045,"great buy, shouldn't open, leads to temptation of touching glowing stuff inside.",4
8046,A must have for covering roots!  I pack one in my luggage just in case!! Doesn't leave marks on upholstery.,5
8047,"Razors cut clean and close, last acceptably long time. I have purchased these before and should continue to do so.",4
8048,i have been on the phone 3 times with waterpik to figure out why it has no pressure and keep getting the run around,2
8049,I really do not have a good review for them. They smell good. That's about it!,3
8050,"Unit motor is giving out in less than 2 years - poor product!
Purchased this in Feb of 2015.",2
8051,"beautiful color , according to expectations, long-lasting and excellent texture , neutral fragrance, I loved",4
8052,Dont think these really work. Worst part is the smell really bad. Like urine.,1
8053,This does absolutely nothing.  I bought a 10$ bottle of conditioner for a 2 year old.  Very frustrated.,1
8054,"vendor was ok
delivered on time
charges were correct
... business as usual.",4
8055,They don't work in a touch make-up lamp.  I have to unplug and plug in when I want light instead of just touching the base.,2
8056,The bottles are small. That's why the 3 star. The oil is good and works well when massaging my honey.,3
8057,Great product. My husband can't say enough great things about product! Uses it every day and has seen great results!,5
8058,Very good fragrance. A good nature smell rather than just a cologne type smell. My favorite of the series.,5
8059,Great price for great oils....We have used them all and almond is the best!!,4
8060,Does what it claims. However I've since purchased the insignia breast pillow so I will not be purchasing this again anytime soon.,4
8061,Burnt my daughter. Doctor said it was a chemical burn from something in this product,1
8062,I though that this item would be an alternative to floss but based on my few of using it I could say that I am disappointed.,3
8063,I wish the company would not have included their logo as part of the tattoo..,3
8064,"They weren't the right color. They came pink instead of purple, but other then that they work fine and didn't come broken",4
8065,Best soap! I've been using it for years! Cured my eczema!,5
8066,My ordered and loves it so guess what I love it if she loves It and if Mama is happy every body is happy!!!!,5
8067,Very good pump. I have two and i have no complaints except that it Could be a little less tall.,4
8068,Amazing! It gets all the greys around my face that show too quickly in between my colorings. Love this product!,5
8069,These fit my SmartSeries brush fine but they are way too hard.  They're also really big.,2
8070,"It seems to do what it says, just like Breath Assures, but with a touch of mint!",5
8071,A fine razor. I rotate this with a Futur and a Godfather.,4
8072,"It came on time. I love  this color.

.",4
8073,after several uses it does nt heat upproperly.  would not recommend this to anyone. price was right product was not.,2
8074,Would like something a little more fine in bristles like my old hairbrushes used to be but appreciate the fact that it is free of animal cruelty.,4
8075,This product has many uses and is very high quality!,5
8076,Not a miracle oil but definitely a good sealant. Smell is very tolerable. Seconf tim ordering and will order again.,4
8077,Its a smooth cream but not enough coverage and you cannot blend in with foundation.,3
8078,"Lotion is very greasy, heavy, and takes a long time to absorb in without leaving residue on everything you touch.",2
8079,"Doesn't fit. Be very careful picking out your Braun stuff, make sure it's going fit!",2
8080,A top notch shaver for the price.  I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend it to others.,4
8081,I love the color of this lipstick but it does not stay on at all. I constantly have to reapply which is kind of annoying.,4
8082,took three weeks to get to me and the brushes are only ok.  But they hardly cost anything.,2
8083,Pleasantly surprised by the results. This formula works nicely into the skin with zero irritation and noticeable minimization of fine lines.,4
8084,"I know it was cheap but it won't stay shut, waste of money!",1
8085,Not as nice as some of the others I've used so far harder to part and hair wasn't sewn in as well,3
8086,kind of works...but you have to press hard and it leaves a temporary mark and it can cut you. and hoenstly fingers work better lol,3
8087,I like the smaller size and the discreet color of the box.  The tissue is good old Kleenex quality.,5
8088,I ordered this item in a prime pantry order and received a 2-pack of really basic Oral-B toothbrushes instead.,1
8089,"Love the color , has a shimmer to it. Stays on all day.",4
8090,"Didn't do what I wanted, which is to smush a bunch of soap remnants. Too small.",1
8091,product and packaging musty; package looked like it had already been open.  item not returnable.  regret this purchase.,2
8092,Stick great.  Wipe area with rubbing alcohol.  Wore these for up to 10 hours.,4
8093,"This unit worked well and held a charge, but after about a dozen uses the head kept falling off.  Parts are rather cheap plastic parts.",2
8094,Good blush but not quite color I was looking for but I still use it.,3
8095,I am very satisfied with this product I mixed it with my conditioner and sat under a steamer and it left my hair very soft,4
8096,"I love this pencil. It gives u very natural look.
FAST SHIPPINH! 10/10. Will order again",5
8097,Very oily and left a lot of build up. The no poo method just isn't for me.,1
8098,"I received an open, empty package without the concealer in it.",1
8099,Kind of dries out the skin and doesn't do anything to hide or improve wrinkles. I won't buy this again.,2
8100,If you need a good shaver at a good price---this is the one for you.,4
8101,if you collect owls you love this !  Very low price too. Great gift.,5
8102,"Not very good quality, good for a preteen but not adult!",2
8103,Met all expectations for quality and the product was packaged well.,4
8104,"works just as well as the coochy by pure romance, but this is cheaper.",4
8105,"I'm not really n love with it, because it sprays all over.",3
8106,"Love it, curls/straightening damp hair with one motion.  Easy to use",5
8107,It's ok for that price.  What can I expect!,4
8108,I feel like it doesn't get you 100% clean unless you wash twice and the freshness wears off sooner than with other brands,3
8109,"Foams and leaves your mouth feeling clean and fresh, not a lot of flavor but a nice rinse.  Will continue to get from subscribe and save.",4
8110,I found this product to be very effective in the removal of my body odor.,4
8111,Very happy with my first time using it my hair was manageable,4
8112,Should work well as a travel dryer. It is relatively quiet. Has enough power to do the job.,4
8113,"It's pretty big, the chains are really long, but I can fix that with some pliers.",3
8114,"The barrel is larger than 1 1/2"" it is to big for my hair length.",2
8115,"When I received the item it was broke, the bottom fell off. Looks more like a clam without bottom",3
8116,"The heads were not in an original Phillips package so they could have been ""knock-offs"" bt they work OK",4
8117,It got stuck first time I used it and wmtool a while to remove.,2
8118,Very nice stylish looking razor. This razor is very quiet and it cuts close every time without much pressure. I like the contour shape,4
8119,I have acne scars and covers them pretty good not 100% but maybe 85%  i like it. will definitely buy again,5
8120,It is a little bit too short. So it is hard for me to help my kid to use it in his mouth.,3
8121,That is a 5/5 star product right there. Much better cleansing  results than from many other shampoos I have tried.,5
8122,Received very quickly however it doesn't work at all. I tried to secure it to both a tiled surface and a fiberglass surface and neither worked.,1
8123,"Tangles like crazy! but nice color and pretty soft:)
Not shiny at all, looks really natural.",3
8124,Really STICKY. It doesn't go away with ordinary soap.,1
8125,Great product it gives my hair that shiny look I want without a sticky feel. I use the product as a part of my daily routine.,4
8126,"Nice texture, not over oily, light fragrance and the touch of lemon is just right",4
8127,"Meh, a decent but fairly uncomfortable disposable to be perfectly honest I could not recommend it",3
8128,It streaks and looks like crap going on. In order to make it look good you have to put it on perfectly straight.,1
8129,still more expensive than a woman's version but a better bundle price online than a single at the store,4
8130,you get what you pay for...top quality...what a difference using this blush versus the cheaper ones...,5
8131,The intensity of the hot hair is not as good as it could be but otherwise a good value,4
8132,FINALLY got the size I wanted!  THANKS!!  IT IS GREAT!!,4
8133,"do NOT like they way this smells! buy one instead to try it out.
m",1
8134,flat!!!  no arch support at all.  Get Dr Scholl's heavenly arches.,1
8135,"Works well enough, wish it had a timer for 30 min off and 30 on, and bigger capacity",3
8136,Very disappointed that I ordered a 3 pack per the website and I only got one of the sponges!!,1
8137,Have used your curling iron products for years and continue to do so. Thank you.,5
8138,Cheap material... Pearls have both fallen off but I replaced them with super glue and haven't had a problem since.,4
8139,I had a hard time getting these to create a decent hairdo.,3
8140,Description says velcro closure.  Comes with two flimsy metal clips that don't hold anything.  Save your money or spend more and get something better.,1
8141,I really like this product. I splash it on my face in the morning. It smells great!,4
8142,Works as advertised. A little to rough for my gums gave away,4
8143,Does this fit the big Col. Conk soaps?  I need something that will take the big/large size Col. Conk soaps.,3
8144,"It works, a bit too big, like all these devices, it takes time and effort to use properly. Easier than flossing.",4
8145,"No smell and not sticky. Does the job, too.",4
8146,Excellent product. Fast reliable delivery and service. I was pleased.,4
8147,"Product was as described & shipped perfectly. Unfortunately, it didn't fit my husband's Art of Shaving brush so I will be returning.",4
8148,"It does not open wide enough to keep the Quran almost flat open. But, I will still use it.",3
8149,Tubing too short and too rigid could cause waterpik tubing to break or the waterpik to fall and break. Otherwise OK,2
8150,Maybe I'll like it once I figure out how to use it?,3
8151,"It's cool but the chain is weak, VERY WEAK",3
8152,Beautiful and the razor and shaving brush look awesome on the sink.,5
8153,It could help wash the stuff stuck away. But it could not whiten the tooth or wash the old things.,5
8154,They look longer on the picture but are shorter then I thought.,2
8155,Works great! Gave it 4 stars because it does not have a tool for each family member. It has tools for different types of jobs.,4
8156,Fit like a charm with good protection while allowing full functionality.,5
8157,"I ordered the color ""heartbreaker"" and it's more of a brownish color. Staying power is great though.",3
8158,The durag is probably nice asf but I never got it so...,1
8159,It's strong and taste fine but gives me a migraine when I use so I stopped.,2
8160,Love the product! Works well and is highly recommended for any rashes or redness. Really protected my son's bottom!,4
8161,Its the second product i have used that holds my hair.....the other one is not manufactured any more.,4
8162,"Seems like all replacement heads are too expensive. But even at that, these heads made my shaver cut like new. Overall a good purchase.",3
8163,"Does not work. Underarm odor after 2 hrs.
A complete waste of money.",1
8164,especially the container. Thought they were a bit bigger though. And the other display pictures it shows multitible size diamonds.,4
8165,"It's great. Cause skin dryness, hence needs to followed by applying deep moisture like coconut oil/butter.",4
8166,"Smelled like paint, but everything else was as expected for the price!",4
8167,Unit is not securely fassined to the base had to remove felt to tighten terrible :-(,1
8168,Great for hiding your piercing but falls out when your sleep,1
8169,You are better off going with cooled cucumber patch over your eyes.  This product is all about esthetics and lovely smell.,1
8170,Good Product but very expensive. Has helped problems with my eyes as doctor indicated it would.,4
8171,"I applied this in the morning, then around midday only the lip line was left.",3
8172,not as much abrasiveness as other products on the market. Might as well have bought a useless actual pumice stone.,3
8173,it is better than my last electri shaver but not as good as a blade,3
8174,"I like the fact that it's made with naturel ingredients, but the company should do sth about the fenugreek smell. It was giving me headaches",4
8175,I think this stuff really works. When wearing it I reactive more attention than usual. Hooray!,4
8176,These have a good price but the material is pretty thin.  Good for short term use but don't expect years of life.,3
8177,Nice product. Only complaint is that the nozzle sprays in a stream and it spatters a lot.,5
8178,"Smell really good, but don't taste like anything. Nice and silky though, perfect for a massage",4

8181,"Great product, I just wish the curling iron holes were bigger.",3
8182,This was a gift I gave my daughter and she is very happy with it.,4
8183,Pretty. Elastic is too thick. I cut out the elastic and just use the clasp. Great price.,3
8184,"love the scents, but have no way to identify which is which to reorder",4
8185,Just used it once till now and as of now it is good and I have no complains. So far so good,4
8186,This product caused a burning sensation. I do not recommend this product. Keeping dry should not be at the expense of burning parts!,1

8188,i just started to use and its not a full like i expect. it seem like half empty.,3

8191,I love the water pic however the button has got stuck so therefore NOT very happy!,1
8192,Not enough booty for my booty...bottle came half empty.,1
8193,The blades are a good quality and sharp enough for two or three shaves depending on the beard.,4
8194,THIS IS NOT MUSK IT HAS NO SCENT AT ALL AS A MATTER OF FACT IT STINKS PLEASE REPLACE WITH REAL MUSK,1
8195,Love this stuff.  Works great.  Definitely will buy again.,5
8196,I prefer the lavender soap but wanted to try orange too. It's very fresh. Def try lavender if you haven't.,4
8197,This product is awesome. no more razor burn or ingrown hairs. This is usually 20.00 each at the store. ok,5
8198,"This was worthless could do faster and better with a course emeryboard, I am returning it.",1
8199,"Great selection, comes off best when wet. Worked to get us through 4 hours a day of patching for my 5 year old's lazy eye.",5
8200,A bit disappointed with the blade as it gets blunt after 10 hair cuts. Not recommended,2
8201,"Products seemed ""dried out"".  Had to add water to use.  Won't purchase here again.",2
8202,worked great until the handheld part broke off from its hose.  now its worthless.,2
8203,Soothing and refreshing! My teenage granddaughters really like these too! Nice stocking stuffer,5
8204,Guess I am rather dense but cannot get razor clean unless disassemble like cheaper razors.,2
8205,They were not for the right razor.  I can't find the correct ones.  Perhaps they are discontinued.,1
8206,Beware.  It says pack of 6 but I only received 1 pack.  Definitely not worth $19,1
8207,Battery lasts a long time. Does a good job.,5
8208,I was very disappointed when I received the two sets in purchased in cheap plastic bags with no brush bag to be found!!!,1
8209,I've had this wax pot for years and it still works great!! Came with all the supplies needed for at home waxing. Great price,5
8210,Perfect compliment to my red dress for the Flapper party.,5
8211,Just opened the box the metal spokes are bent and broken.  Highly disappointing because it looked beautiful online... would not recommend,1
8212,"I need more of these.  A must have for anyone with allergies to lotion, fragrance",5
8213,Hubby and I are very impressed with this product.  Wished I had bought a waterpik years ago as my teeth might be in better shape,5
8214,"The wife liked it. She said it works fine. Her only complain is, it's too plasticky.",4
8215,Arrived on time. I am pleased with this product.,5
8216,Glad to have this on hand in my medicine cabinet in case I need it. Thank you.,4
8217,The Waterpic quit working after one year.  Bad investment!!!,2
8218,"this shaver does not trim well as it takes many times to trim a small area,& the attachment falls off easily.",3
8219,"this pill made me sick, nausea and headache, the smell is awful. If you pay more I would get stimulair.",1
8220,I use it with my GoPro cameras and I'm able to place my cameras and locations not normally accessible because you have to use a clamp,5
8221,does not stay sharp over limited time of useage - am considering other than Phillips razor for next electric razor purchase,2
8222,"AMAZING!  Great quality, great price, fantastic brushes!",5
8223,"The Jewelry looks kind of cheap, but for the price i guess you can't beat it.",3
8224,"It couldn't shave smoothly, and once left my skin bleeding...The batteries were used up after only three times. Don't buy",1
8225,"Works great, just needed to get used to turning the tip rather than having to twist my arm a little.",5
8226,I feel like it doesn't get you 100% clean unless you wash twice and the freshness wears off sooner than with other brands,3
8227,The battery life on this thing sucks. I have to charge it 3 times just to get in one full shave down there.,1
8228,"Doesnt help, purchases to help a blister and it makes no difference even after a week. Not recommended.",1
8229,The soap smells really nice upon opening it and does a really good job of keeping lady parts clean and fresh throughout the day,4
8230,Vitamin C cream is the bomb. It really works on my 3rd jar already. You can feel it working on you skin especially the forehead.,5
8231,"Easy to use, gets teeth really clean. First water pick that I did not spend 20 cleaning up after use.",5
8232,"I really like this caps, they keep your hair moisturized and don't strip it of its oils.  It is a good buy.",5
8233,It performed well but caused my tongue and mouth to burn after using.,2
8234,This really helps you digest your food better Worth a try!,4
8235,We reorder product.  Been using rejuvenate potent Jamaica castor oil now for a few weeks and I see good results,4
8236,CRAZY RAZOR BURN! I had to sleep in leggings for 3 nights because the sheets touching my razor burned legs was so painful...,1
8237,This item is created for a child size hand.  Very disappointed in the size of the item.,1
8238,Purchased these for a Kentucky Derby party and it was perfect.,4
8239,Nice and light. Only wish the inside didn't have corners and was more bowl like,5
8240,"I'm using tap water for drinking and cooking, but water tastes much better since I started this device.",4
8241,Too soon to tell for fungus seems very effective at keeping things dry.,4
8242,Fragrance is strong without being overpowering.  Good quality Rosewater.  Will purchase again.,5
8243,They are usable but probably the worst I've used over the past two years with my razor.,2
8244,LOVE this soap.  Used in my homemade laundry soap.  Getting ready to use in other homemade home cleaning items as well.  Excellent and natural product.,5
8245,It was a little to chinsey for my taste...but fairly priced for the quality.,2
8246,Came in quicker than expected but there's not 3000 gems in here! But for the price it was so worth it ! Id buy again(:,4
8247,"I  love this ring. It fits perfectly.
Paulina.",4
8248,The closure is a button that was not securely sewn on. Other than that it was ok for the price.,3
8249,"It works very well at blister prevention in long runs. I have used other lubes but prefer this one.
Highly recommend it.",5
8250,Just started using Aveda products and I have to say they are great!,5
8251,"Best thing you can do for your teeth and gums, is clean between, and this waterpik is awesome.  Many attachments and works great.",5
8252,I hated this product.  It is thick and melts off your face in warm weather,1
8253,It's definitely no false lashes but it really makes a difference! I use it every day- and the more you apply the better!,5
8254,I would have liked if the lining was a light color.  Its hard to see the products with a dark lining.  I returned the item,1
8255,These were for my daugter for her cos play out fit of Ceil on black butler Anamie. She liked the & they came in a timeloy manner.,4
8256,"So watered down, I didn't feel like it was actually shampoo. I tried twice then threw it away.",1
8257,"Smelled nice, but the sprayer didn't work well.",4
8258,"Does a fair job but to it's credit, does not nick my sensitive ""manly"" area.",3
8259,I have been using aquaphor for my little ones for years now. I love it for everything and the best price is on Amazon!,5
8260,Great color.  Wish it came with a shake cap so it wasn't all exposed.  One drop and you will have a huge mess.,4
8261,Color started to come off and I had to bend the metal piece because it dug into my lip. It's sort your money though.,3
8262,"Don't like the smell, it's very strong and unpleasant",1
8263,Not worth money...use any gloss will work same!,1
8264,The powder works ok for a few hours. probably should have went with a scent.,3
8265,Product is pretty good for the cost. The consistancy is a little off but seems to be doing well so far.,4
8266,"It was annoying. Itchy, and total waste of money",1
8267,It does the job I guess. Not the best.,4
8268,This a VERY very gross product!  I have nnnno idea what's in it.  But. I. Don't. Want. To know!,1
8269,I didn't care for these studs. The stones were not shiny and I found that the stones easily fell out.,3
8270,Bought to protect my hands against sun damage. Soft and comfortable to wear.,4
8271,Received quickly. Not an overly aggressive blade so great for beginner or sensitive face. Great price.,4
8272,They are easy to use and you see the results with just a few applications.,4
8273,My husband likes this product. Can't find in our area so always order from Amazon.,4

8275,It's really good I see a difference in my skin starting to tone out my less dimples,4
8276,They were not very sharp but will do the job.,3
8277,It's okay but rarely used. I rub coconut oil on me instead.,3
8278,"I always wondered how my doctor maintained that ""I just shaved yesterday"" look, now I know.",4
8279,Really oily feeling and hard to remove from skin. Not sure I'd buy it again.,2

It takes only few minutes to shave.",4
8282,"they got here, they fit, I had to clip some strings off but who doesn't? LOVE EM. Would buy em again.",5

C'est vident pour utilise cette dodorant .

8291,brush was way too hard.....I thought they looked flexible.,2
8292,The glue does not stick to even poly. It is not good quality.,1
8293,it works fine. takes some time to get used to. not close enough to my point of view.,4
8294,Such lovely little rings...wear one or two or all at one time...love them,4
8295,"Needs to be replaced every 18 months. Not available in stores. Only newer models of this shaver have replacement.
Please keep in stock!!",4
8296,"Manic Panic, amazing hair dyes and Electric Lizard is one of my favorites",5

8309,Wife said it is just ok. Some other less expensive products are better.,3
8310,Not quite small enough for two of them to fit in my light.,4
8311,The wig is petite or small. Did not fit a 18 year old head with short hair,2
8312,Excellent waterpik. Updated design that is very easy to use. Would recommend this to anyone who wishes a super clean mouth!,5

8315,I got this for my brother for Christmas and he said it didn't get a really close shave under his jaw area.,2
8316,Not as dark as I thought. Still kind of bright I could actually read  A book through the lenses on these glasses.,3
8317,"""Smooth"" means less razor whipping, made for sliding and hooking.. Sharpness gives clear tactile feedback, and good for 4-5 shaves.",4
8318,Great product... Will last a long time.. Will order from this seller again and again,5
8319,"The bottom was red so I used it. It didn't work for my baby, it caused more severe rash.",1
8320,Bought this years and years ago. Still kickin'!,5
8321,"Makes your skin very soft.
But cloth is very rough!",3
8322,have used bic3 for years and expect these to be as good,4
8323,I like that this set almost everything...but the set had a strong smell...had to was more than once before i used them.,3
8324,"I loved it in the beginning, but I've had it less than a year, and it no longer works!",3
8325,Strips are not like the whitener strips. They're super tiny. Not at all what I expected. But they do help a lot with sensitivity.,3
8326,The stone fell off in shipping but I will glue them back on with e6000.,3
8327,product to almost 2 months to receive - and it wasn't a great quality would not recommend it,2
8328,Doesn't break or shred. No awful sent or taste. Easy to get between tight teeth and gums. Does its job well,5
8329,This works very well with implants and crowns and has made the dentist visit much more fun.  Definitely recommend this product.,5
8330,Cheap packaging. Must assemble yourself. Had black marks on them when arrived. Positive side: Great bright color. Durable goggles. Work well.,3

8335,"Works great on wet hair, you will not want to nuse it on dry hair.",4
8336,This cape is so cheap. It barely covers the back. Hair sticks to it and does not come off unless washed.,1

8344,because i couldn't get borderland  game of the year serial key.  but other than that.. the rest was fantastic..fun game.,4

8346,"milky and has that definite Japense ""what is that smell?"" smell.",4

8348,"This product is wonderful for keeping the house smwlling fresh.
Thanks",5

8351,Love this product so much... very close to expiration date. Only negative FYI about my product.,2
8352,Very sturdy and sassy but huge! They are 2.5 inches from the clasp to the base of the oval. I sent them back,3

8354,Got it very cheap when the deal was going on. Liked it. Doesn't felt a lot better than my Mach3.,3
8355,Makes your hair feel awful and dangled and very dry.,1
8356,"It's hard to hide the bands in my hair and the tape irritates my skin.
It's just not something that I would use again.",3
8357,Not very powerful....wish I'd have gotten a Dremel tool instead.,2
8358,it is ok this item .not very special. same price  at walmart.,4
8359,I like these because they don't bind and restrict as much as the toe tapes. But I wish they didn't stretch so much,3
8360,This is easily absorbable and I hope tightens up my face.,4
8361,threw them away . . . soooooo cheap !!!,1
8362,It gave me a razor burn sooooooooooooooo bad my girlfriend asked if Satan grabbed my face!,1
8363,"My face feels tight and it does help diminish the wrinkles, however as soon as I put moisturizer on it begins to peel off.",2
8364,"I was in a panic because I had used this for years on my lower dentures. Glad I found it, but was way over priced!",5

8366,Great polishes but they do not stamp very well in opacity or over dark colours,2
8367,I didn't love this. It's ok but I wouldn't buy it again.,3
8368,It smells amazing but doesn't make suds like Dr. Bronnner's castile soap. I won't buy again.,3
8369,"got it last week and only used it less than 6 times, the button on the handle now stuck and will not work..junk!!!!",1
8370,This box will last forever.  Excellent shave and highly economical buy.,4
8371,Didn't see a difference in my skin actually it just burned... My skin made it dry and chapped.,1
8372,"Shaves well.  Not as sharp as Feather brand.  But, I don't have as many nicks and cuts, either.",4
8373,Because they broke as soon as i put them on.,1
8374,"Great unique necklace for the price.  Bright gold, flexible, and magnet is adequate for its purpose.  Would recommend to a friend.",4
8375,"Doesn't cover very well - I assume that like most one-step-wonders, you need the spot concealer that they seem to mention only at the end.",3
8376,Cute headband. Am disappointed as the material has already separated from the headband base. I have only worn it a few times.,3
8377,I could not use it by myself at all. Once I got it in it showed. It was hard to take my hair back out of.,2
8378,"PROS - These are wonderful colors, Cheap
Cons- Uncomfortable between my toes.",3
8379,"This product is great. It works wonderfully with all the parts and everything. Perfect, thank you amazon!",4
8380,Like it. The packaging of this product should be better in the near future to make it more appealing to customers.,4
8381,I purchased this item for my teenager; who has braces. She loves the feel of the Water Pik. She says it massages her gums.,4
8382,"I highly recomende using the Waterpick for oral care. Would not beleve what you miss just brushing your teeth.
Love it.",5

8386,"This is some Great  stuff,  only  sold online now. I will be buying  every bottle",5
8387,Havent needed to use yet.  But it is the solution for my new braun shaver and it keeps it clean and lubricated automatically.  I like that.,4
8388,"Didn,t work for me. used it for three weeks.trash can it",2
8389,"Smells great and works!!
With us having 3 school aged girls I will be keeping plenty on hand during the school year!!!",5
8390,"So much prettier in person, which I didn't expect. Seems well made and doesn't wobble. Will get one or two more.",5

8392,This product is so strong I can use it again.,1
8393,Very nice lotion just wish the apricot scent was a teeny bit stronger.  But overall it feels very nice on my skin,4
8394,I absolutely love the smell of this benzoin.  I am very happy with the value and will definitely be reordering.,5
8395,"One of the feet was bent in and my husband had to straighten it, but other than that it's been fine.",4
8396,"Be careful, it is very strong and made me feel nauseated.  Not sure what I can do to dilute it without changing the scent.",3
8397,The new formula does not go on as smooth as the previous formula.,2
8398,I wanted to hang it from my lanyard but the hardware did not hold up and I lost the pen.,1
8399,Nice design. A little awkward with trying to keep water under control in mouth while under higher pressure. But use at mid=level pressure is good,4
8400,I thought this was going to be a very good kit but it is missing some things yet the price is really good for starters such as me.,4
8401,This is a good moisturizer but there are many good moisturizers out there for much less money.  One and done.,2
8402,LOVE this color. Super smooth. I'll be buying this again. :),4
8403,"The new waterpik arrived in fine fashion, and my wife loves it even more than the last one.  What more can I say?",5
8404,"I still prefer my regular curling iron, although this is fine for a quick touch up.",3
8405,"Product arrived damaged with bottle empty.  Two bottles were fine, but I want a refund for the third.",1
8406,Wow. Love this and my hubby loves using it as a beard trimmer too.  Great product.,5
8407,It's not good product @all just waste of money  ! The shipment is fast & ok!,1
8408,This a very sharp blade and keeps the cut real smooth... I really enjoy using these razor blades a lot.,4
8409,These don't seem to be the same as the last I purchased....  Maybe not as sharp.,3
8410,Really good blades. I like them so far. Works very well with Merkur shavers.,4
8411,This is a good product.  It does what it is supposed to do without splitting.  I don't hesitate to recommend it.,4
8412,Color on the cool side as I was expecting warm happy colors. Disappointed,3
8413,Soooo...luminance color...brilliant enough... a brush must be matte..,3
8414,It over heats quickly... Not enjoying this purchase at all.,2
8415,I use it every night. It's important to give your skin these ingredients to help rejuvenate it overnight. Plus the lavender it calming before bed.,5
8416,"It serves its purpose, but I wish it had a separate heat setting.  You only get heat or the cool blast button, nothing in between.",4
8417,Little sort in the back and large in the neck. Otherwise good.,4
8418,ABSOLUTELY THE BEST THING EVER. Way better than the portable versions.  This waterpik will clean your brains dry without ever trying.,5
8419,I do not like thes roller. They donot stay on the hair.,1
8420,"I like my new Norelco shaver.  It does a good job, giving a close smooth shave and it does not make a loud noise.",4
8421,Very pretty but fragile. It would look stunning with fine blonde hair.,3
8422,A little flimsy. Shorter on one side than I thought. Does what it needs to.,4
8423,I like the powder better than the cream.  Works great under breasts and areas of skin friction and sweat.,4
8424,The box says it's quiter than earlier models - no ttrue.  This unit is very loud and annoying.  Works great otherwise,3
8425,"Too orange for me; I'm a pale redhead, more pink and white than orange skin",3
8426,This product is far from what is described I am very un-happy I will never recommend this even to my worst enemy!!!!!!!,1
8427,These aren't 'regular' razor blades. They are 'flimsy' and not great for cutting without a blade holder,2
8428,Poor quality. Several of the stones fell out in the package and more fell out after I opened it,2
8429,very upset this bracelet broke the first day my daughter wore it very cheap made product I would not waste money on this,1
8430,Dull blades.  Cheap single blades are better than these. Cuts my face more than my beard. Don't bother with theses.,1
8431,"I did receive mine coupleof days back. Only thing I gave 1 star was, the product expires next month.",1
8432,Poor bottle design it started to leak and I had to throw it out,1
8433,"Not bad for the price. They are cheap, but hey you get what you pay for!

Nothing a little clear nail polish can't fix!",3
8434,"I would go with the water flossers that you could attach to your sink or shower instead, much more convenient.",3
8435,"The product arrived on time and in perfect condition. I am very satisfied.
Art",5
8436,"Don't think I will use these on my nails, I will use them on my cards.",4
8437,decent soap but i felt like its odor was a bit strong,3
8438,"Love the scent, love the way it makes my skin feel and the price is great! All around an excellent product!",5
8439,The only issue is there aren't replacement main flosser tubes included.  It has more attachments than necessary for most folks.,4
8440,My dry cuticles soak this stuff up. I've been looking for something like this to include in my nightly regimen and this was perfect.,5
8441,Had purchased this set from another retailer and was looking for more. Glad I found it again and was exactly the same as my others.,5
8442,So what if it smells a little. It gets the job done and no more irritating razor bumps!,4
8443,"They are what they are, the only thing I did not like about it is you cant pick your colors",4
8444,"great product - color is no where close to my skin, so I mix it with my foundation and it works well.  Love it",4
8445,Wonder when someone will come up with a solution to tangled cords... this product is good the button is a bit stiff to release brush...,4
8446,I don't think this is a new one. The bottle is dirty.  There was only 3/4 cleaner inside,2
8447,The thick sides only worked on all my pens. Couldn't get any detail out of them,2
8448,"LOVE this! Great on toddlers, too. Its one of my go-to baby gifts.",5
8449,I don't know what exactly a toner should do but I can't see any difference between this product and water!,1
8450,CONTAINES INGREDIENTS THAT ARE HARMFUL TO MENTAL  WELL BEING.  IT CONTAINS ALUMINUM PRODUCTS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO MENTAL UNSTABLENESS DUE TO BEING ABSORBED INTO THE BLOOD STREAM.,1
8451,"CHANGED MY MIND, GOOD PRODUCT, SLIGHT WARM FEELING, GIVES FULNESS TO BREASTS, GOOD PRODUCT.",4
8452,"It is okay, but not as fresh as I expected",5
8453,Cheap product. Was only able to use it once before it stopped working.,1
8454,I have stuck with the Venus Divine razor because the blades do a better job of shaving than anything else I've tried.,4
8455,Item came on time. It does cover well but not on tattoos. Its not smudge proof. Comes off on clothing.,2
8456,"the make goes on think, it does last a while though. Would suggest does NOT cause acne like base minerals does.",3
8457,It does what it should.  They are very minty so right after eating is a bit of a shock but they certainly work.,4
8458,Color wasn't exactly as expected but it's still a nice lipstick.,3
8459,"Great mask, blocks light well.  Not made for larger noses!",4
8460,"Don't like the scent, don't find it better than lots of other products that smell better.",3
8461,This device flushes food from the pockets between my teeth unlike floss that frequently drives it in deeper which makes the situation worse.,4
8462,"I love this.  The bristles help ""grab"" the hair to curl it.  The only negative thing is that on/off button is really touchy.",4
8463,I revived the products and one of them was damaged.,4
8464,Love this product BUT at the end of the day my face is a little greasy price is great 2 cheaper than walmart.,4
8465,Not sure if the product has changed its label but the product I received was not the same as the photo.,3
8466,"I did receive 21 nose rings. However, most were of a yellow color.",4
8467,Sharp and well made.  Also has a handy protective holster.,5
8468,Still waiting patiently to see results with only 1 pill left:(,2
8469,Huge improvement has been made to this appliance.  Many options and adjustable spray are welcomed additions for us.,4
8470,"Small, but effective. A little bit noisy, but it does the job. I recommend this model. Works well for the cost.",4
8471,"The thigh lifts work for me. They stay in place all day, even in summer heat and and help eliminate sagging knees.",4
8472,Its on for temporary use but doesn't hold for very long on white girls scalp,3
8473,I love this product and think it is a great value for your money.. I will definitely buy again from this supplier when this runs out.,5
8474,It kept falling off! Then when I actually got it to stay it would crinkle up! It was annoying. ugh,2
8475,"the inside isn't really that good, they come off easily, and the product is hard to clip on, but i still enjoyed these.",3
8476,It is nice just a little thinner than I expected.  A little high in price and should be a little lower.,3
8477,"Great soap!!! I used to get it at Costco, but no longer available there.",5
8478,Finally found the size that I need for quick touch ups.,5
8479,I LOVE this and so does my man. Highly recommend. It smells like flowers and happiness <3 haha,5
8480,My wife and I enjoy using this.  Looking forward to shorter dental visits.,4
8481,Its good you have to use with water it is thick like Vaseline witch I think works just as well,3
8482,I received facial cleansing products instead of silver shimmer hair spray by Jhirmack!!,1
8483,"great hair product, doesnt leave any flakes. arrived on time and secured. overall, for the price it is a good deal.",4
8484,"This shaver is definitely worth what I paid for it . but it does seem a little lacking in power , but shaves decently",3
8485,"This bath soap is refreshing and invigorating.  The price is a bit much, however, so I use it sparingly.",5
8486,serves purpose well. only thing is that it fells of from its strap often .,4
8487,"Ok, I guess, but no substitute for a Waterpik.",3
8488,"Initially the wrong product was sent, but when I complained the correct one was mailed.  Thanks for fixing the problem!",5
8489,Really very good quality for the price... was an awesome finish to my She Ra Halloween costume.,4
8490,Not as durable as I imagined they would be but definitely does the job.,3
8491,Didn't work well for me. Smells good but didn't keep me smelling good all day,2
8492,"Great price!  Product received exactly as described, in perfect condition and  on time.  Thank You",5
8493,This product really didn't work on my child's acne.,1
8494,"They flatten out wrinkles for a while, but it doesn't last.",3
8495,Dry lipstick. Not good coverage. Feels yucky!!,1
8496,These were to small for my nose. Probably about a 20G size and i'm an 18,3
8497,looked super fake and also fell out of my nose when i wore it and i lost it.,2
8498,BEST OIL EVER!  this product smells great and works like a dream.  I love it.  I would definitely recommend this to friends.,5
8499,"Definitely not worth the price, store brands or cheaper salon brands do the same job. Works fine, evaluating without considering the cost.",3
8500,I don't think it has had enough time to work,3
8501,"Bs , bought a 3 pack already on the second one since the first ripped only my second time using, won't be buying again",1
8502,"Over powering smell, doesn't feel like it treats the skin as well as some other products.",1
8503,"They are fun, but a little heavy to stay in thin hair.",4
8504,not like my old one...does not seem to be as well built....curls hair different too,2
8505,My hair is softer with less frizz after blow drying.,5
8506,"This glove is good. Fingers just s little bit long for me, but I am petite. Serves its purpose to protect from UV light.",4
8507,It comes with all of the grooming aids that most men will ever need and is very simple to use. It is a very solid razor accessory.,4
8508,"Reasonably priced, shipped fast and works as described. Pleasantly scented.",4
8509,works very well.i thought it would stay charged longer though. it takes so long to charge.,4
8510,Do they still make this floss?  It's my fave - strong yet thin.,4
8511,This is a wonderful product and I found it here at a great price!,5
8512,It does the job. It is a bit more sheer than most of the ones that I've purchased over the years.,3
8513,The color is very metallic and cheap looking. It more looks like a 0.99 version from the dollar store.,2
8514,Very poorly made.  I ordered 2 and both came in broken.  Center jewel not even attached.  Didn't even get to wear them once :(,1
8515,Didn't really work. Maybe my polishes were too far gone?,2
8516,Don't know how this product worked because it arrived practically empty! Zero stars!,1
8517,Super sticky and hard to handle. Came with a bunch of lotions and creams except  wax remover.,1
8518,"Tiny, terrible. Just a lump of cloth, impossible to get a lather.",1
8519,Saved a few dollars over the local discount store prices. Was exactly the right set.,4
8520,The price was much better buying it on line and my dentist thinks using it daily has been very helpful.,4
8521,"The expiration date was October 2010!!!! They don't make this product anymore, and it should not be sold to anyone!",1
8522,"simple color & great for everyday use.
Update:
It gets loose so, when I opened it the whole lipstick flew out of the container.",3
8523,We got the waterpik for my daughter who just got braces. It is helping her to help her teeth clean before she brushed them. Great product.,4
8524,believed flosser would produce a higher pressure stream  also body shakes when dialing up pressure past 5  does an adequate job of flossing,3
8525,It's pretty & all but feels very cheap. Other than that it's nice,3
8526,nice belly rings. was upset to see that not all the ones in the pictures came in.,3
8527,this nice eye shadow lots of shades very good product for the price,5
8528,"It is what it is, works, what more do you want?",3
8529,The worst thing on planet earth. Please don't buy it!,1
8530,The product received is like the one described and works properly for its use. My wife is very happy with it,4
8531,VERY NICE FRAGRANCE AND WORKS VERY WELL SO HAPPY I  BOUGHT IT!!!,5
8532,"Don't buy these cheap, dull razors. Worst razors EVER",1
8533,"no issues - got what i wanted, simple to choose & complete purchase, received within time specified, less expensive than other sites",4
8534,My chain came in pieces. broken. I was really looking forward to this and now I just want my money back.,1
8535,So far this oil makes my natural ethic hair soft when applied to my dry hair and scalp. So far....still being reviewed by me.,3
8536,Unlike anything I have ever used.  I use the soap on my face in the shower and the oil at the sink to wash my face.,5
8537,"Bought this to use with an acid peel. It's like a thinner Vaseline, and seems to work OK. Would buy again.",4
8538,Couple of my friends loves it. It's time to try it,5
8539,I purchased this for daughter when she got her braces.  Invaluable tool for keeping her teeth clean. Easy to use.,4
8540,Wonderful product. Works splendidly and does a great job at cleaning between your teeth. I highly recommend this product. worth the money,5
8541,Actually keeps matte finish to skin for long periods of time. Still suggest oil blotters as well.,4
8542,"Seems to work 95% of the time. Per reviews, I only take one pill daily.",4
8543,They came on time and they are adorable! I love them.,4
8544,its ok but not for me. it doesn't last long on my skin.,3
8545,Smooth and easy to use. I like the long lasting 40 meters.,5
8546,Screw the burn. I can live with that. I can even live with the weird foam. Its the bad taste that drives me crazy.,4
8547,Not the quality I was expecting based upon previous purchases.  I will be returning to my old vender.,3
8548,"I needed what was in the photo, not just the blades.",1
8549,"It was exactly what I was looking for it works great, no tangles",4
8550,Works fine except the tube that feeds the water is too short! I would NOT recomended for a tall person.,3
8551,Very very bad.dont use this.this leaves wax residue which does not go away with anything and leaves a black mark on skin.,1
8552,Product was received promptly and delivered the medication well.  Patient did receive positive results with medication delivery.,4
8553,"This is a great product to use on skin especially for bedridden patient's.
It is the best bang for price and its utility.",5
8554,"cheap good razors, blade spacing is enough that cleaning is easy",4
8555,Can't seem to find DentoTape anywhere.  My Dentist recommended I try Amazon and he was right!,4
8556,Stuff it very hard to use because it dries really fast. Drying as soon as you take it out of the bottle.,3
8557,"Colorful and pretty - easy to spill, though. I prefer the wheel arrangement-
glad I bought 2 wheels.",5
8558,This stuff is great!!! Cuts the healing time down at least 25% on my new tattoos and almost no itching!,5
8559,"Broke on first use, as in the nuts and bolts holding together fell apart and the whole thing fell apart. Super cheap bad quality",1
8560,"So far, so good. My daughters love the smell. It came properly packaged and on time.",4
8561,It is only good for a second time shaving on the same day after shaving with a much more expensive electric shaver.,3
8562,"Bad design, It is not giving a close shave, but hurting the skin. It is even worse than disposable razors.",1
8563,"Since I ordered all four, I was expecting one of each color. Instead I got 3 purple and one blue. Bummer.",3
8564,It's just like all the other products I've bought and didn't work well.,2
8565,"This really is the perfect blush.  Just the right amount of pink and peach.  Plus, it stays on all day.",5
8566,I used it once-it worked ok. I will use it again,4
8567,I thought it came with the wax off. Had to buy it separately.,3
8568,Literally fell apart into pieces within minutes of use. Clicked the light on and it all fell apart.,1
8569,"This is very nice the chain is just right length, and the pendant is so pretty!",4
8570,It did not hold my pack of 100's too well.  I gave it as a gift.,3
8571,"it has a strong smell at first, but now it is ok",2
8572,Didnt have any issues but recommend taking the patch off before bed. Sticky residue for a couple days,4
8573,"Used it right away. Honestly ""A size above"" and a must buy for those who want their whole body covered and protected from hairs.",5
8574,Only giving it four stars because this is a gift and not sure of performance.,4
8575,Have followed all instructions and cleaned after each use. it is not working well and does not diffuse to cover the small room.,2
8576,5 months and it no longer works. Flow nozzle on the end would not stay on. Great dryer when it worked.,2
8577,It fits my trio stealth g4 10.1 the clamps are tight but because it slips easily from the corners it may not be that good for carrying around.,4
8578,Disappointing. I expected the jet to be more powerful than it is. But it does remove food particles lodged between teeth,3
8579,"I got this for free from a Gillette sponsored program.

The handle size and shape make it very easy to control.",4
8580,"Although I did not notice any hair-growth, my hair seemed to have gotten thicker and stronger after taking the supplements for several months.",4
8581,"Very nice, but turns stomach green after a little.",4
8582,You can't expect something like this to solve already existing toe problems that may be beyond the help of this device.,3
8583,Got the order earlier than expected. Recommended by pediatric dentist.,4
8584,i bought this as a gift and it was well appreciated and seemed to work really well.,4
8585,Pretty decent. Brush become very hard very quickly. Did not come with brush cleaner although it is listed in the products needed in the instructions.,3
8586,I love this product. It is gentle on the skin and smells fresh. I've used it for years.,5
8587,Just did my nails so I'll see how they look in a week or so.,3
8588,This candle doesn't stay lit long enough to even be used. Disappointed.,1
8589,Beware this item is useless in my  opinion. Too small for hair clipping. Shaver doesnt cut. Do not buy. Too many parts for nothing.,1
8590,"Awesome Product. Like it so much, I bought some for gifts",5
8591,Not what i thought they would be reminds me of disposable feminine hygiene products,1
8592,Fine as presented.  Bulb is small so make sure you know that.,4
8593,"Excellent pigmentation, great nude color, like all Wet N Wild lipsticks is very drying",4
8594,unhappy. not what I had planned for. too small.,2
8595,Haven't noticed anything different. People still act the same towards me. But I love the smell. The smell is enticing.,4
8596,Nice sounds fun to use! Stick it but don't lick it!,4
8597,"The power was not so good.

But in all, I like this product",4
8598,I like the item it took like two weeks but it was worth it.,3
8599,"Works pretty well, not as good as another brand i normally use. Seller does great though",4
8600,The kit is good but the Creme Wax is terrible/ impossible to work with. I had to order the Honey wax seperately.,3
8601,"Can this be used for thighs too
Plz reply. (:",1
8602,Excellent shaver. Holds a charge for at least a dozen shaves.  Trimmer works well.  Easy to clean.,5
8603,I should have read the reviews and not purchased this item. The kit is way too small for the price.,1
8604,Doesn't seem to do anything. My grey hair with dull yellow sections still has no shine,1
8605,Wonderful product I cannot do without it! My hair is manageable and shiny!,5
8606,Brush holder could be a little better made to accommodate wider brushes.,3
8607,Worked well at first. After one year the rubber gasket has worn out and won't hold water in reservoir.,3
8608,"The scent wasn't original, kinda like a knock off!",1
8609,"This is easy to use and good for your healthy teeth!!! If you want to keep good teeth, you can click and buy it.",5
8610,LOVE IT. I WILL RECOMMEND IT TO ANY ONE. GREAT VALUE FOR THE PRICE.,4
8611,This renewal cream makes the face seem more hydrated. I like it.,4
8612,Smells great but it the smell doesn't last more then 10 mins.,3
8613,This razor seemed to work well but irritated my skin. I will be returning it to Norelco.,1
8614,"I received 1 Tool, for those wondering about the quantity.",1
8615,it isn't silver its white and its alot larger than i thought it would be. But for $2 what do you expect,3
8616,Does everything I expected it to. I have used floss in the past but this waterpik ultra water flosser works just great.,5
8617,Small toy like brush.  Completely unlike the original and unable to clean the shaver head. Don't waste your time on this product.,1
8618,"Could be a bit thicker, but they do the job.",4
8619,its oily but makes my face soft after wearing it over night i love the orange smell,4
8620,"Works great and looks great, what more can I ask for?",5
8621,Toilet tissue rolls drop right in. The details make it pretty. It is not flimsy and very sturdy and dresses up bathroom.,4
8622,These were a little cheaper and didn't work in my tight teeth as other floss stick have in the past...... more flossy and less glide ribbon,3
8623,TOO GOOD.... our dog did eat them both :-(,5
8624,This is more for contouring. More dry feeling..It is very dark even on olive skin try blending with a lotion etc,3
8625,This wonderful fragrance is light and airy.  Lovely aroma that many ask what is that you are wearing. Hope you try it.,5
8626,I love love love this the honeysuckle honeydew and sweet mint or the only flavors i like but its way over priced,5
8627,"If you use this every day, your dentist may have to sell his Porsche. I do have to set the pulse power up fairly high.",4
8628,"There is no game that can compare to this! Is so complete as a game and history!
Love it indeed!",5
8629,Very nice product.  Great quality! Package arrived on schedule.,5
8630,"This has always been my favorite after shave. Not too strong or weak. Just right, and a good price as well.",4
8631,Love this stuff!! My hair is also thinning in the front so it works to hide the thinness as well as the grey!,5
8632,Doesn't work ... very expensive and doesn't work.,1
8633,Not good for thick hair bit felt sturdy and well made for thin hair,3
8634,It smells ok to me but I haven't had anyone following me around because of it!,3
8635,"This was awesome for a beginner of make up i'm 15, and my friends thought I had a make artist! lol!!",5
8636,Arrived quickly. Exactly as advertised.  That's all the needs to be said.,4
8637,Poor material.  I have average size hands and they are way too big and stretched out.,1
8638,"Fragrance is okay, leaves my son's fine blonde hair very soft",4
8639,"great product and works better than cheaper brands. However, it's expensive and the is quantity is low.",3
8640,Stays on for a while but it's hard to take off that's really the only bad thing.,1
8641,Perfect! So nicely made and love the compact design! ^i^,5
8642,Did not like this product I had this item sitting up in my make up organizer and my liquid foundation completely ran out of the bottle,1
8643,The case looked great but it did not lock and that was the only reason for the purchase so we returned it.,4
8644,Used entire bottle per directions and never saw reduction in dark spots.,1
8645,It's ok...I use it in addition to flossing. It is noisy and messy.,3
8646,"the brushes didn't have enough hair.. even though the selection is great, the quality isn't great... wish i got something better.",2
8647,way too heavy for fine hair. perhaps would work in thick kinky hair,2
8648,Don't waste time or money.  It does not look like picture at all.  You cannot tell what it is from more than 4' away,1
8649,Smooth easy application. Felt like I wasn't wearing any foundation,4
8650,"Used for a month, can't really see any difference",3
8651,Don't waste your money on this.  You're better off buying a hair clipper for less and using this with it's attachments.,2
8652,Need these tapes to just pull my neck a little tighter....Feel so much happier when I wear them.,4
8653,I did not care for it!  It smelled  and felt strange & I usually love Camille Beckman products.,1
8654,I love these brushes! I was a bit nervous but once I used them I was very pleased. They grab the makeup nicely!,4
8655,Price is good but probably will go with originals next time.  Will see how long they hold up.  Worth trying.,3
8656,Right out of the box this is very dull and does not compare to the job that my previous Panasonic had.,2
8657,This is a great little mirror.  It stands up with your choice of strength of mirror showing.  Works well. Go for it.,5
8658,I've been using this for weeks with no noticeable improvement.  ,2
8659,"love this product, but it fails to control oil. clarifies really well, shrinks pores and draws out impurities from skin.",4
8660,"It worked as describe once it is used properly.  Especially in cleaning between  braches, however one need to work with it slowly",4
8661,"No spray nozzle like the picture shows,  and the scent only lasts a few minutes. It's nice otherwise.",3
8662,Not silent actually a bit loud. Other than that it does the job very well in a short amount of time!,4
8663,I just love the smell of this Thieves spray.  It is perfect for neutralizing smelly odors in the bathroom.,4
8664,"Didn't work for me, not saying that it's not a good product but as I stated it does not work for me.",1
8665,I LIKE!!!!!!!!!!,4
8666,"Misleading name. This is not Tape, it's just Floss. :(",1
8667,Brush clumps up; not sure how to clean it.,3
8668,"Pretty wimpy.  Not hot enough, not better than hair dryer and brush.  Still looking for a winner.",2
8669,Product is great but the bottle has changed. Very hard to pump out as it has a safety guard on it that often clicks on.,4
8670,it's okay not quite what they picture it to Be,2
8671,Arrived defected. Was not sewed together. Just kept and sewed myself.,1
8672,It doesn't stick at all.  Falls off.  Want to return it,1
8673,"It is good for trimming and controlling a beard.  Wish it had a bigger shaving head, still using straight blades to shave stubble.",3
8674,I was not as satisfied with this product as I had hoped. If I put the pressure higher than 2 it is hard to control.,3
8675,Clasp broke very quickly and is cheaply made. It's easily fixed with jewelry replacement chain. Love the look and the charms!,3
8676,Works well. Very glad it's made in USA!,4
8677,Very oily and not as effective or as nice a finish as the Salley Hansen quick dry.,1
8678,"Just as advertised... It is very convenient and easy to use, my dentist recommends it too. So far it has meet my expectations.",5
8679,does not flow when putting it on and then I don't find blending it to be easy.  I gave it away,2
8680,its work to keep clean and to use it enough to warrant price,4
8681,These will run all day all week. Totally rips through thick hair. I would buy these again and highly recommend to any stylist or barber,5
8682,"Dissappointing from previous Norelco shavers owned. Very slow charge, simply acceptable performance. Go for the upper mid-level price shavers.",2
8683,Doesn't do anything to improve shaving experience.  I just shave in the shower without this. This was a waste of money,1
8684,this is a good product and if you feel that you want to loose a few pounds then this is good for you,4
8685,"This is good pigmented color and the best blush I've ever owned. Sleek, small case is a plus as well.",4
8686,"Heavy, sturdy and looks great in the bathroom. Husband really likes this, great upgrade from his previous plastic brush holder!!!",4
8687,"Simple, basic pads suitable for use in a jump bag. I've seen better and worse pads but I have no complaints",5
8688,for an electric razor it cuts close and fast. recharges well and lasts.,4
8689,"Didn't last long at all, pulled on hairs as well.",1
8690,"blades are good but only received 95 blades, not 100",3

8693,"If you like coffee with lots of body, this is for you.",5
8694,"Have skin feeling soft and refreshed, but it don't really deep clean like most toners. Good to use after bath or shower.",3

8709,Easy to use. Doesn't cut you when you take the cap off. stays sharp.,5
8710,These work okay but not as great as the original brand that came with my pedi.,1
8711,Product is as described and would not mind recommending to friend or wouldn't mind purchasing some more in the future,5
8712,"excatly what i wanted ..fits my hair perfectly ,was searching for something like this for a very long time .Happy with the purchase.",4
8713,Terrible.  Causes my gums to bleed whenever I use it!!  And regular $.97 dental floss works better than this electric flosser.,1

8720,"Much shorter in length than it appeared to be in the photos, but the Amazon price was good enough to keep it anyway.",3

8725,Arrived early!  Surpassed my expectations!  Will order again!,5
8726,The divider between big toe and other one is thick.,3
8727,It was way too short in the back pertainig to hair. Did not cover my scalp. Would not order again.,1
8728,I wish that I could not give it any stars. The little box thing that the oils are in was all ripped and taped together.,1
8729,"These are great quality.  The price is a bit high, but the supplements are good.",4
8730,Tube connecting water reservoir to the hand handle is leaking.,2
8731,I personally enjoy my 3 way poncho. My husband says its a sin against humanity and refuses to let me wear it out in public with him.,4
8732,I am sure this would work on short hair better than long thick hair.  Disappointed in product.,1
8733,I keep this on a small shelf in the shower. It's compact and very stable.,4
8734,The part where the blade is suppose to be held is loose and multiple times have come out while shaving.,1
8735,"It doesn't give the pink hue I was going for, however, it does smell deliciously like rose and grass.",4
8736,I don't think this product works to attract women. But it definitely has a very smell to it..,4
8737,This is the most expensive WATER I have ever bought.  Absolutely no smell whatsoever.  Very disappointed.,1

8744,Pokes the inside of my nose and constantly falls out but that's what I expected. Pretty visible though..,3
8745,"Nothing wrong with blades, but they do not like to shave more than a one day growth. I would recommend buying feather blades instead.",2

8747,Fits my Muhle safety razor and art of shaving brush perfectly.,5
8748,Was unable to properly utilize product as bottle was leaking when arrived.,2

8755,"This is one of the best product lines I have found for my skin.
I would recommend this to anyone whom skin needs extra moisture.",5
8756,"Works very well for body exfoliation- I don't recommend it for the face. Also, kind of hard to clean.",4
8757,I am not too satisfied with this flosser. as it leaks from the handle while flossing,3
8758,"The bracelet arrived damaged, but because of the great price I kept it and replaced the fish that was damaged, now I wear it often.",4
8759,Works well as a setting lotion that helps keep white hair from turning yellow. Doesn't add much in the way of body though.,4
8760,The dentist said to buy it. People plagued by plaque will find this an easy way to remove it and save their teeth.,4
8761,This is an excellent product for mature skin.  The price was also very competitive.  Ulta sells the product for $48.00.,5
8762,I love love love this product. I use before i workout and it does have a stinging sensation which helps push me through my workout,4
8763,These are beautiful. Strong little clips. Super decorative. Great buy.,5

very dissapoined and had to replace with other pump",1
8769,"Made my hair brittle and dull looking, didn't do anything for the itch or dandruff.",1
8770,It feels and acts like a normal 5$ Comb. I don't see the benifit of it being handmade.,3
8771,Like similar reviews the Brush fell out of the metal canister after a few uses. Do not buy!,1
8772,This is not 48 ounces. Don't waste your money,1
8773,"This bracelet was exactly what I was looking for, love it!",4
8774,These products are nice and smell great. I have fine hair and find that using all 3 products together is just a tad heavy.,4
8775,Love this stuff in a warm bath. Very relaxing and makes my skin feel awesome.,4
8776,I really like the stove.......only thing I do not like Is that it stays extremely hot giving off a lot of heat.,4
8777,"Very small , cute but glitter falls out even if the lid is on",2
8778,"Burns like it should, the only thing that needs attention is the cheap cap it cracked on me like the second time I used it.",4
8779,After I have I have to go back and use my $ 29 Norelco to remoive the stubble.  Overpriced JUNK would NOT recommend.,1
8780,good product but does not fit electrical (vibrating) shavers,4

8786,"Did not dry hair at all, just dried out the ends. Returned it.",1
8787,"I love the fragrance and it leaves my hair very silky.  Combined with the Bvlgari Conditioner, this is my favorite brand.",5
8788,I LIKE THIS PRODUCT.  I WRAP MY WEAVED STYLE EVERY NIGHT WITH IT.  THANK YOU FOR A VERY INEXPENSIVE ITEM.,4
8789,The stitching on the velcro came loose. But it is an easy fix. It is good for the price,3
8790,"This is a really good, well made flosser. It gets the little bits of food even after you brush and use dental floss.",5
8791,"I spoke to Norelco on what this model might be and they stated emphatically, that there is no such model as the 7110XL.  Strange.",1
8792,"Works perfect for any type of hair. Dry, greasy or any other. My whole family is happy with results",5
8793,"nice color. not as ""moist"" as I thought, therefore comes off very easily.  my other 12hr lasts longer and is more moist.",3
8794,The bristles are firm yet soft enough to scrub without being painful. So far the base has withstood mild soaking and being dried afterward without noticeable wear.,4
8795,Worked fine but eventually broke.  Bought another on Amazon just like it from a different seller/manufacturer and it broke after about 5 months of use as well.,3
8796,Nice looking small surgical steel nose studs. I especially like the different colors for changing upon mood or dress.,5

8800,You must soak feet every night for the first week to make this work.,4
8801,"Item was delivered fast and is perfect, thank you!",5
8802,this is just a jar  petroleum jelly!!!  vaseline is cheaper,1
8803,I just couldn't get over the old lady perfumey scent.  I have the product away to someone who didn't seem bothered by the odor.,1
8804,They came just as I thought they would. The brushes are soft. It's a very good product if your looking for some new brushes.,4
8805,"Its is smaller and the color is dark and opaque.
It does not look like the image provided here!",2
8806,"Very, very cute. Unfortunately made very cheaply and the large rhinestone fell out the first time I wore it",2
8807,"Not as ""wine"" colored as I'd hoped it was be. I was looking for a darker shade.",3
8808,"fast shipping but smaller tahn I thought, still will use and helps fill up empty space in my BIG purse and holds lots of items.",4

8816,only 3 lights lasted in a week and one more without a month be blind my light.,1
8817,I don't like this product. Not easy to work with.,1
8818,Could hold a little longer but the best I've ever used.,4
8819,Water reservoir does not completely empty and needs to be wiped out after each use.  Other than that a good device to assist with oral health.,4
8820,The smell is terrible. I used it for a few weeks and finally threw it out. Back to Vitalis.,1
8821,Really enjoying all the brushes in the set. Very very soft and the eye brushes do a fantastic job of blending.,4
8822,"Can be very drying, make sure to exfoliate your lips and moisturize them with using this product.",3
8823,"Very low heat at max, not effective for my short thick hair.  Tangles easily in hair. I should have returned it",1
8824,"This beeswax works fine in the lotion I made but stinks and doesn't have the ""normal"" nice smell of well made beeswax.",2
8825,The pen doesn't stay in the cap. Using it as a keychain is useless because it falls out too easily.,2

8827,"It's a very beautiful product, only had a tiny detail: one of the edges was a little twisted. The rest: two thumbs up!",4
8828,Too small for Quran. Size is good for Norani Qaida.i wish it would be big enough to hold Quran securely.,2
8829,Basic grooming kit. It looks like Conair's and you could probably find it at the drugstore but it seems to work.,4
8830,My husband says this is an Extremely uncomfortable shave. He said these blades shave almost like an old dull blade would.,1
8831,"everything has a hint of broze, which is good for cheap bridal packs. the pinks are really pink and good for highlighting and layering.",5
8832,I'm used for more that 3 month and not see different ...For me not work..,1

8836,Excellent product to keep handy. Very rich and non greasy.,5
8837,This deodorant has helped my 8 year old stay smelly free. He likes the scent and I don't have to remind him to put it on.,4

8839,The button on the handle sticks making it very difficult to use without spraying your bathroom with water.,1
8840,"....this jelly is like all aloe jells, but much more expensive....",3

8844,The product was as described and worked well for me.  I would buy from this seller again.,4

8846,Wrinkle free. Not. Came delivered very wrinkled washed it hung it up to dry..still wrinkly. Very disappointed.  Even my husband disliked it.,2
8847,this product did not do anything for me. I wasted my money. I doubt I will buy from seller again,1
8848,easy to use -can adjust pressure like the storage area that is located in the top lid that holds the extra use tips,4
8849,Smells awful!  I went back to using the lavender baby oil! Much cheaper and smells wonderful!,1
8850,"Almost 5 stars. These work really good for me. Thick beard, medium sensitive skin. I use Creamo shaving cream which is awesome.",4
8851,Great tool for healthy teeth and gums. Love it.,5
8852,"Very long and pops out the top, but skinny and small",4
8853,"Does not seem to do anything. I mean, nothing at all. Leaves hair with a weird texture.",2
8854,Irritates the skin.  Vitamen C serums are much better. Tremendous effect and nonirritating.,4
8855,"Did not know this product was similar to Vaseline.  It is clear which is okay, but it is not very moisturizing.",3
8856,"it tastes too sweet, which I did not like about it, the color is nice though... and yeah, it is very moisturizing.",4
8857,"I was expecting a heavy cream; instead it's heavy Vasoline. However, it is effective for soothing, but very greasy as should be expected.",4
8858,"Smells nice, scent doesn't last. Made no difference in how I felt or was perceived with regard to attractiveness.",3
8859,It feels very high quality and has an amazing shine. Fits both my safety razor and my brush - works perfectly!,5
8860,The wife loves it. Yes she's appropriately soft.,5
8861,Use this daily and I find it powerful and that it really cleans between my teeth.  Hopefully it is also doing a good job on my gums!,5

8863,"Great shades. Easy to put on, wraparound, just what I wanted.",4
8864,This works well as a sun protectant but I don't think it stays in place as well as the Babyganics stick.,3
8865,This paste is thick yet washes off quickly in the water. I had to reapply yet my kids still got a slight burn.,1
8866,"It is pretty cute. It is somewhat flimsy, but cute.",4
8867,"Much smaller than the picture makes you believe it's going to be, but still a beautiful piece of jewelry. Perfect for a gift",4
8868,The water pressure is too high even at the lowest setting.,2

8872,Thought this was the one with glycerin but it's not. Worked okay but the one with glycerin suited my needs more.,2
8873,Norelco is a good name and this product lives up to its reputation.  Easy to use and gives a good shave.,5
8874,This is my second waterpik. It tends to last a little more then 3 years with two people using it daily. Its worth the cost.,4
8875,I was really hopeful that it wad going to get rid of my strawberry legs but it didnt.,1
8876,Very cute activity. Everyone enjoyed it and was impressed with the idea in general.,4
8877,I love the rosemary mint combination but this one was a tiny bit harsh smelling... but that is more a preference than anything wrong with it.,3
8878,My husband love this product. It is very effective and makes your teeth white in short time.,4
8879,I absolutely love this product. I have long hair and this works great without being heavy. And it smells amazing!,5
8880,"The kids love the pump design and the flavor.
Very easy to use.",5
8881,"I have used Olay products for years, and do like them.  This lotion is light and easily absorbed into my skin.  I like using it.",4
8882,Every blade has a sticky feeling from the wax wrapper. The edge doesn't last at all and they become very uncomfortable to use quickly.,1
8883,"Adorable, the lace flips over a little on the collar so that's annoying but it's not for comfort",4
8884,"Fine product,shaves well and holds it's charge for eight to ten shaves. Hard to beat at the price.",4

8896,Waaaaaay too loose on my head!!! Kept falling off!,1
8897,Very nice castile  soap product and an excellent price point.,5
8898,"I bought this for my granddaughter, who is a teenager, and she loves it.  It is very light weight and gets the job done!",5
8899,"The curling iron works okay, but it takes a very long time to heat up. When your in a hurry, it seems to take forever.",3
8900,"i like my razor, I think it does a great job. Everyone should get it.",4
8901,Its beautiful but doesn't last long.  My daughter put it on and it broke 30 minutes later. Very cheaply made.,2
8902,"The clasps have broken on the first use, so I had to use my jewelry tools to fix it and prevent it from happening again.",3
8903,"Your product  just leaks all over the sink----I should probably return it, because I find I don't use it..too messyl",1

8909,Love them! But the string doesn't stay on right!,4
8910,"Good product, great for someone who is just getting into special effects makeup!",4
8911,The bottle came with only about 40% of the cream... it was almost empty. Very disappointed,3
8912,They are very thin and could break easily in thicker hair. I really don't expect them to last too long.,3
8913,I returned this because the quality was sub par. It came with a slight malfunction due to material.,1
8914,i love my brushes  had them for a very long time a few broke. they are worth their price and great for beginners.,3
8915,"Its a lot smaller than I imagined, so I gave it to my hubby and its perfect for him!",4
8916,Works ok but not alot of detailed scale of colors so can't do preceise measurmenbt of ph but good for general idea of your ph.,3
8917,"Very nice looking, sturdy and at a great price!",5
8918,"A bit  disappointed with the assortment. No pinks or light colors for little girls. Functioned well, though.",3
8919,"Has a nice, fruity-like smell... but doesn't really last. Still like it though. However, not sure I would but it again.",3
8920,Have used this product for the past 7 months. It has proven to be a great shampoo by improving the overall health of my hair.,4
8921,"Bottles are really small.  I don't think I would order again,",3
8922,this stuff works great. smells good and keeps my skin moisturized all day. I need to get a bigger jar for sure.,5
8923,Perfect fit for our pulse ox. Nice quality for the price.,5
8924,I just started using this product. The only issue I have is that it is too loud. Hopefully it works since my dentist recommend it.,4
8925,"Some of the brushes don't work or apply makeup as well. But for the price, it's a good 'backup' to turn to.",3
8926,We can't charge the product because the voltage isn't the same in the USA than in France.,3
8927,"I received my order on time, and the products were not broken which I was afraid of.....the smell is heavenly Caress body washes never fail",4
8928,Can't use it on my face. A huge bump formed on my cheek hours after I applied it and it hurts and looks awful.,1
8929,I returned the razor within the 30 day period.  It was too noisy and did not shave as well as I expected.,2
8930,"Performed fine the first couple times.  Then nothing, it doesn't work anymore. Not worth the purchase.",2
8931,"Did absolutely nothing for me. Waste of money
:-/",1
8932,This necklace is really cute for the price. My daughter loves owls and she thought this was really cute.,5
8933,kinda scratchy....great price  but not as sharp as others with similar pricing.,3
8934,Nice for the price paid only thing is to be careful with glue or top coats since the pearlescent coat comes off easily,4

8936,"Light and airy, not too dark and does not look like heavy blush",5
8937,"was a gift for our granddaughter, not sure how she likes it",4
8938,"The only complaint I have is they are really short, if you have a thick nose they won't work. Other than that they are nice!",3
8939,"Pretty bracelet, very stiff, and didn't hold up well.  Considering the price, it was fair.",3

8944,"This scarf slides right off, this isn't the answer for wild sleepers sadly",3
8945,"these are listed as soft, but the handle flexes more than the bristles.  These are very bad for someone with soft gums.",1
8946,This is an excellent case not only for make up but for much more!,5
8947,"Too much alcohol content, and size like a lip balm",1
8948,Great product! I saw my hair felt healthier and stronger for sure!,4
8949,Great - can be closed up and there are air holes in top of cover so brush can dry out,5

8958,I love this to spray on my face after applying moisturizer.,5

8983,"This is the only brand my husband uses.
He tried a different brand & he said it did not work.",5
8984,I think is the best one i've used so far.,5
8985,Did not like the left over white residue on skin.,1

9005,"Not made as well as the one I used to have, but it does the job.",3
9006,I really like this but I think the water container should be larger. Sometimes I have to fill in twice.,4
9007,Color is as expected but I do find it to be a matte-I'll be using a clear gloss over it,4
9008,Thick and great for night time. I like the smell and it seems to be very moisturizing.,4

9013,Color is a little different then what is pictured. Not really feeling it,3
9014,One head worked and the other (2nd head) did not work.,2
9015,Handy and healthy natural tooth cleaner. I keep them in my classroom and use them as a quick way to freshen my teeth after a snack.,4
9016,I did not care for these gloves. They are not as soft as others I use.,2
9017,its no good. The wax is like taffy and doesnt come off of anything and it hardly holds to the hairs,1
9018,I do alot of children face painting.  This kit worked out well to do multiple faces.,4
9019,"Works very well, good smell if not a bit over bearing in scent.",4

9026,"I wanted a color that was a bit different than my normal nude color. Its bright, but really pretty.",3
9027,I must not have thick enough to use it. Some instructions on its use would have also helped.,1
9028,"my son didn't like it, he said it doesn't work",2
9029,"It smelled weird, it was like putting clay on my face. Returned it so fast and switched to Nars.",1
9030,"This is the best smelling of the eos lip balms, but I find my lips dry even after using it.",2
9031,Color is too dark and it takes kinda long to apply...but it does as described.,3
9032,"Goes on a little sticky but is fine in about 5 minutes, All day color!",4
9033,The forms were way too small to do anything with. Im starting my return today,1
9034,"This is hard and dry cocoa butter that rattles around in the container, not smooth enough to go onto your skin unless maybe you microwave it first",1
9035,Too large for my head.  It does OK with helping keep sweat out your eyes.  But it was simply too big.,2
9036,"This is quite effective, but it burns for a few minutes and leaves the skin extremely dry.",3
9037,THESE ARE CHEAPER DOLLAR STORE LOOKING I WAS EXPECTING SOMETHING DIFFERENT WOULD NOT RECOMMEND TO A FRIEND AT ALL...SORRY THIS SUCKS.,3

9041,"Good for sensitive skin, maske skin feel smoother, not sure how much of an impact it has on age defying.",4
9042,It can slip right out if you don't grab it right and that gets ridiculous.  Otherwise offers good protection and well worth it.,4
9043,The slivers of soap encased in the terry cloth bags didn't get up enough lather to be useful.,1
9044,It's a shiny double-edged razor and brush stand and it works.,4
9045,got it for grandson he loves it'. It's quick and easy to stay groomed at all times Stays sharp too,4
9046,"Not for everyone, even though everyone is saying they are great.  They are a ok.",2
9047,Very cute and fit well. Some screw from front so can be difficult to get in otherwise get a lot of compliments on them,3
9048,Great build quality. My razor an brush look great on this.,5
9049,Didn't know how to work with it. The substance in the jar is to hard.,2
9050,"The item was covered in mold. It cleaned up ok, but that should have been discovered before it was shipped.",2
9051,"these were very thin and my husband did not like, so i am stuck with this big box of bad blades.",1
9052,"So far so good.  I've been using the razor a couple of weeks now, no problems.  At this point I'd buy it again.",4
9053,Still contains salycilic acid which I cannot use in pregnancy. Its sitting under my cabinet.,1
9054,"The blades on this are not very sharp, and the length adjustment collapses when in use. I would not recommend this trimmer.",2
9055,My teeth feel clean after using.  I don't have room on my counter otherwise I would use it more.  Was delivered in the time promised.,4
9056,Great product to keep the dentist bills down.  I would buy again,4

9059,"Very clean, fresh & light. Great when using Pecksniffs Grapefruit & Citron Bath Gel & Dry Body Oil together !!!",4
9060,Product gave a comfortable and close shave and would recommend to anybody. Easy to install and order was received promptly.,4

9062,"Good product, but not as good as the really old all metal ones",4
9063,Doesn't seem to generate the amount of suds I would like.,3
9064,"We get these delivered once a month, love them!",5
9065,This spacer stays in place and protects toes from rubbing.  I am very pleased with it and will order more.,5
9066,"It's cute and I've received lots of compliments on it. I can tell it's not super fantastic quality, but definitely worth the price.",4

Bought two, second still working. Would not recommend.
Expected a lot more from Phillips product line.",2

9075,"They work ok, but they don't get as close as the Gillette Fusion razor I used to have. Won't be buying again.",2
9076,I'm usually not picky on smells and perfumes..  But thus one smells bad to me..  I don't even dare  to put it when my husband is around..,2
9077,Not as good as the reviews say but still a decent comb. Blades definitely need to be longer.,3
9078,Clasps fell apart on second wear... looked nice but not durable at all buyer beware,1
9079,In general it is ok! It takes a long time to warm up. The wax is very sticky and it's easy have a big mess,3
9080,Loved the colors. Loved the price.  But it's not very moisturizing.,4
9081,Love these. Super cute and small and a lot of different colors,5
9082,"Noticed nothing. Smiled back, made eye contact, walked by slowly.... Nothing.",2
9083,"Nice size, and smells good. Good quality and fair price.",4
9084,Seems strong and sturdy. The edges of the hooks might scratch the finish of your razor if you care about that sort of thing.,4
9085,"Its a great improvement, but l'm still experiencing some foot odor. Do you have anything that's fights odor better?",1
9086,"They work pretty good for the price, but when i washed them they kinda became flat otherwise it blends okay",4
9087,I don't get a lot of glitter on my eyes the Glitter stays on brushes.  The colors are great tho.,2
9088,"Absolutely love this product! I usually get bumps after a hot wax, but not this product! So amazing!",5
9089,"I have olive skin and this is too light for me - so, I would probably not use it.",2
9090,Again wouldn't stick to my glasses. The adhesive got in my eyes.,1
9091,Absolutely my favorite scarf. It is the perfect 2 loop length.,5
9092,"My favorite floss that is kind of hard to find in stores... That said, it's definitely not my husband's favorite.",5
9093,Crappy product. Dried out within a week and didn't work that well before hand. Save your money and find something better.,1
9094,The smell isn't bad its ok I like it it helped my hair grow,5
9095,very good....working without problem for two years..and still using it.,5
9096,"tubing thinner than I thought, not much use for it.",2
9097,Very opaque. Easy to put on and easy to wash off. Blends well too.,4
9098,"It does the job, but is awkward to hold in the shower/tub.",3
9099,"Works great for bunion toes .Overlapping and too close is very annoying, causes chafing , these work great.",4
9100,The two big ones worked great but the the three smallest ones snapped. I would not rec. these brushes. they are not great!,2

9106,Dont buy !! All my jewels fell out before i got it in my nose .,1
9107,Needed a replacement for a damaged part and this was just great.  Will look at another when the blades loose their edge.,4
9108,I bought for my wife. She was using the yellow and now she wanted try this new one. She loved.,5
9109,"its not much bigger than 5cent match box, but for it's intended purpose it's good
to lather and doesn't have much scent.",3
9110,Nice bottles but you can keep the corny gold pen.,3
9111,They fit and seem to keep the razor very clean.,5
9112,I agree with Laura that the previous formula was way better because the new formula has too strong of a floral scent.,1
9113,It works great until the hose breaks. I'm looking for a replacement now.,4
9114,Burns like crazy and smells harsh. I don't even think it helps the razor glide better.,1
9115,Try tea tree oil instead of this. I would say it works better. This dries out the skin way too much,3
9116,WORKED AWESOME. Saw a tutorial to apply this to stretched out cotton balls to create realistic looking wounds and it was awesome!,5
9117,IT HAS A GOOD HANDLE GRIP TO IT BUT WORKS NO BETTER THAN A GOOD WOOD HANDLED STEAK KNIFE.,3
9118,I bought this to try and combat my dry skin. It helps during the summer but in the winter I still have the problems.,5
9119,I am amazed at how well this works. Thank you,4
9120,Bottle came half empty and is missing the top cap.  Looks like cream has already been used.,1
9121,Very rough and tuggy blades. Not like the GEM PTFE blades at all.,2
9122,"I like the spray, but the sprayer does not work well.",2
9123,My favorite. The best for dry skin. I use it day and night. Absolutely amazing on its' own or under foundation.,5
9124,Really to don't have ingrow hair but you have to put gloves because it's might expoliate your skin un your hand,4
9125,I wish the gems were a little smaller and actual stones.  these are those cheap glue on gems!,3
9126,it's pretty good but doesn't do the job that I needed. also it is not scentless.,3
9127,Taking this along with other supplements.  Hard to tell which are working and those not being a success.  Been on in for a number of months.,4
9128,Product arrived quickly in an easy to dispense container. It's so hard to find regular razor blades so really happy to get these.,4
9129,Its not pink AT ALL. This is orange. Very deceptive,1
9130,I buy it all the time...best for Brunettes that I have tried.  Covers my scalp where my hair is thin and makes it look better!,5
9131,This formula is thick and one needs a little dab for your whole face. It has not caused break outs! Should last a long time.,4
9132,"It's hard to say- the containers were not sealed, and there was product dried all over the outside of the packaging, but not much inside.",1
9133,"I like this very much, have not had an issues with it yet.",4
9134,"Love, love, love this product!! Great coverage and very easy to apply...highly recommend!!",5

9137,Love the sent. Wish the fragrance lasted longer after the shower was over.,4
9138,"it worked great until it broke down yesterday, blowing a fuse in the house at the same time. I used it twice a day, everyday.",1
9139,I LOVE the tingly feeling I get when I use this product. It's smells so good and makes my skin sing.,5
9140,"I have been using it and it does OK, the bristles are a bit too long for short hair.",3
9141,I love the headband kit. They were easy to make at the baby shower. Everyone enjoyed.,5
9142,These clippers were very dull. They are not sharp enough to cut fingernails let alone toe nails. I would not recommend them.,1
9143,"Quantity is enough, hasn't begun to use, if there is effect will continue to purchase, looking forward to the effect.",4
9144,This shampoo lathers up great and I swear it makes your hair thicker!,5
9145,you really get what you pay for. the brushes were stiff and coarse. irritated the skin.  i would never recommend them to anybody.,1
9146,it works wonderful : it keeps your mouth clean very quickly : and i cant live without it: works amazing after a meal,5
9147,Looks masculine and fits my blades/ brushes from different manufactures just fine!,5
9148,"Love the scent, however for the price I wish the sizes were a little bigger.",3
9149,"Seems expensive to me, but it is a nice comb. Evidently handmade costs more.",5
9150,Love the smell of the tanning lotion and the fact that it has glitter. Came wrapped in plastic and in great condition.,4
9151,Smells like a dream. Did seem to lighten some areas up. It just didn't quite produce the effects I was seeking personally.,3
9152,I really wanted to like this product based on tutorials I have seen. But there are cheaper styling puddings and custards with better scents and moisturizing ability.,2
9153,"Amazing quality, my only problem is how long it took to ship.",4
9154,"I was expecting more from this moisturizer.  It goes on well, but it seems to be no different than any other moisturizer.  Kind of disappointed.",3
9155,"Broke down after 5 months, very disappointed, too much trouble to ship back.",1
9156,Ouch!! Dull worst razor I've ever bought.,1
9157,"Would not turn on when I got it, so returned it. The digital on and off did not work but once.",1
9158,"It's a beautiful cloth; smaller than expected, but it works perfectly as an alter cloth or to do tarot readings on.",4
9159,Very happy with my first time using it my hair was manageable,4
9160,"Rusted out pretty quickly.  The opening for the razor was also too narrow.  Looked nice when new, though.",2
9161,"Not the best, not the worst. Worth the price and shipped in reasonable time.",3
9162,Excellent product and really enjoying to use. The entire mouth feels excellent after each use.,5
9163,"I've had this product for about a month, and it works just as described.  Much easier and less time consuming than flossing.",4
9164,"They seemed big enough for me, and very cute and worth their price! :3",4
9165,Like this cream so much I bought some for my sister. It haas great coverage and is easy to apply. Gives your skin a uniform appearance.,5
9166,"falls off easily as I sleep and toss about, oversized. just buy a silk or satin pillow, it's so much easier!",1
9167,Anothere great Conair brush that you won't hace to deal with the bristle tips falling of after a few months.,5
9168,"I don't know, do you want to burn your face first or after you shave? It is good stuff for the right person.",2
9169,"I like it and have no complaints.  However, I am not sure about it durability over time.",4
9170,love these brushes! The eye ones are especially soft and perfect for blending! Would definitely purchase again,4
9171,Happy with it. No negative remarks. One important feature is to use it both with and without the charger.,4
9172,"i don't like this product
i hate the consistency and smells horrible",1
9173,I have come off hormone patch with using this product.  So glad!,4
9174,"Smell is okay everybody, but there is no sex attraction and anything like that.",3
9175,"Good sharp blades gives you a nice close shave with out nicks if your careful, it is a single edge
Blade after all.  Blade life, acceptable",4
9176,"works great but not a long life on the batteries. Wish it came with a wall adapter for the hand held device,  Works good though",4
9177,"i love it ! the brush is soft and does not sheds like some people had complain about.
wish it had more brushes like for foundation etc.",4
9178,"When i revived the package, there were NO gems in the container/s all in the bag!",1
9179,"More comfortable than I expected. Doesn't put pressure on your eyes. Little bit of light comes through, but it's very minimal.",4
9180,My wife liked it. It's very nice. Could have added more colors instead of same color 5 times.,4
9181,"The brush too  thin for me. The polish is  a great consistency, so I'm  able  to use one coat.",4
9182,"They're nice, I like wearing them in my nose, but the gems do pop off at times, but still great",4
9183,It did not performed the way it was supposed to.  The blade wasn't sharp. It did not trim the side burns.,1
9184,"Arrived quickly..however didn't like smell...smells weird sweet like caramel but also like medicine, like burned sugar...not for me",3
9185,Pretty poor product.  Wouldn't purchase it again....Rip off.,1

9217,It's not for blackheads cleanse. I do not think it's useful.,2
9218,if these are still $13.00 then it's a great deal. You buy them at a store and they're twice that,5
9219,"I've tried every grey hair color coverup, this is excellect.  Doesn't get on the pillowcase",5
9220,"reading all the good reviews for this product made me purchase this, but it did not work for me. i took the capsules and nothing happened.",1
9221,It's beautiful but some pieces were broken off in the packaging when it arrived.,3
9222,This marks the third time for me to buy replacement heads. My 7+ years old Norelco shaver is still spinning.,4
9223,"Ive been using this mouth wash for awhile. It tasted okay, keeps my mouth feeling fresh, and my teeth stay pretty white",4
9224,Just what I wanted.  Used as a young girl.  These barrettes are grat!,1
9225,This product leaves a film on your under arms and stains your clothes.,3
9226,"This is a great scent, but it seems to fade more quickly than I would like.",4
9227,They run small n I suggest it be posted in the information about the bras,1
9228,Love this blow dryer/styler.  Wish it also came in 1/2 barrel since I have short hair.  It would give me a bit more curl.,4
9229,I you put your cell phone near your credit cards it will deactivate the magnetic strip!,1
9230,"Braun Clean & Renew Cartridges

The cleaning fluid is dirty, leaving a brown stain on my shaver.  Cartridges are totally unsatisfactory.",1
9231,This makes shaving a little less cumbersome. The item can get a little pricey but seems to be worth the product considering the value I receive.,4
9232,"Tried it for about a year, didn't work. Male pattern baldness is continuing right along.",2
9233,"great color for brunette who want a natural look.  The product is a little on the dry side, so I apply lip gloss over it.",3
9234,No good quality at all. Not worth what I paid.,1
9235,Fast delivery. it smell good. I don't know if is really works but worth a try that is for sure.,3
9236,Works great on the face.  It cuts very close.  It doesn't work too well under the chin.  It just doesn't cut it.,4
9237,"I love them! They are so nice, makes my nails pop with shine and color, they look like nail jewelry :)",5
9238,Love this brush set. There is a brush for each area of the face. The brushes are soft and durable and easy to clean.,5
9239,The product is really nice but it just arrived on Janyary 3rd?  Missed the date this was ordered for Christmas.,3
9240,Product arrived in a timely manner and was as described. The actual box of the product itself was a little damaged but the product was fine.,4
9241,My shaver is a washableplain water. But that can rust out the screen. Works as advertised. Good price.,4
9242,"Doesn't work for my intended purpose, but has other stated applications as well. and eh.. Kind of leaks once in a while",2
9243,A good product and good price. Easy do handle e shave well,4
9244,So chinsy and cheap and tacky!!! Broke so fast.,1
9245,"Works well, but the motor is too loud. I would use it more often if it was quieter.",3
9246,It does absolutely nothing for my brown spots.  Nothing at all!,1
9247,This is a great moisturizing body wash. Leaves skin silky soft for hours. A must buy who wants soft skin.,5
9248,This is not the real Manic Panic - Do not buy it,1
9249,This is my first time using the product and It makes my breasts itch and sting a little . Hopefully it stops after I use it for a while,3
9250,"It's a nice stand. Well built and good foundation. But does not fit the ""Art of Shaving"" badger brushes.",2
9251,Really didn't like the color. It looked different from the picture .,3
9252,Love it! Works ony cracked feet & nothing else has!,5
9253,"Even though it says it's for partials, mine popped out during dinner. Don't get.",2
9254,It is only 2 inch long looked really big on Pic,2
9255,I noticed no difference in eye brightening or intensity of dark circles. I ended up using this as a face cream just to use it up.,1
9256,"Brush is very nice, good large diameter for larger curls. I like the clean white color. Will order another in the 1/2 inch size.",4
9257,GREAT PRODUCT. GREAT FOR TRAVELING WITH.  I WILL RECOMMEND IT.,4
9258,Well it works well with the shaver's cleaner so how could it possibly be better than that.,5
9259,"This is great, especially in winter when you have an icy back;)  Reaches where a scrubby can't.",5
9260,"The problem with this kind of razors is the price of the blades. However, this is a great product bought on sale",3
9261,Product seem to work but the strips are too flimsy and the gel is to hard.,2
9262,"Very disappointed, all of the gems fall out of the stud",1
9263,"I really, really like the color and the matte finish, but it does leave my lips a little dry.  :/",4
9264,"Work very well, just like in the old days.",4
9265,"These are perfect for wearing with a wig, but they were hard to attach to my normal hair",3
9266,"Doesn't fit ""Latherwhip's Best 100% Badger Hair Professional Shaving Brush"".  The brush side is just a tiny bit too narrow.",4
9267,Excellent product.  Easy to apply--men will love it and look good wearing it.  Buy it now or else you'll be sorry.,5
9268,not a strong smell of argan oil but this lathers up well with just a little bit. leaves skin really clean,4
9269,The pen's tend to fall out of their caps.,3
9270,The brushes were suprisingly okay. Great for there cheap price,4
9271,I love it beside the ball didn't want to stay on and so I'm using a colorful one,3
9272,"Good product, but will require cleaning every few weeks to prevent mold buildup",4
9273,So happy with this syrum. I use it before bed. This will make your skin more sensitive to the sun so make sure you use sunscreen!,5
9274,"I dropped it from small height, the top has become separated from the body and the shaver can no longer be used.",3
9275,Feels great. Doesn't hold much soap and you have to keep adding but that probably applies to all sponges. Very durable and useful.,4
9276,This curling iron is the right size but my hair does not slide around the barrel like it does with other curling irons.,1
9277,"Nice but thought I was getting 2 of them, one with Logan and the other with Wolverine. But still over all very nice and good delivery.",4
9278,The only trimmer I've bought that won't cut me. Great buy,5
9279,I purchased this razor based on Computer Reports evaluation.  It was not as good as the review,1
9280,Hard to latter up and too small of a tin. Once you you get a latter this product works very well.,4
9281,CD was cracked and does not work. I have to search through YouTube to find the workouts.,1
9282,I need a stronger moisturizer for aging skin. I don't not want anything with a strong scent and this fits the bill.,3
9283,Once again I read hundreds of reviews that state it feels great. I want to hear about deep wrinkles and tiny wrinkles.,1
9284,Great quality. All the pieces are stainless steel. I like the case too. Fits perfect in my bag with all my polishes.,5
9285,"Smells lovely, and works well.  The rose scent is just enough to make me smile, and definitely not overpowering.",5
9286,I was very pleased with this transaction and would deal with them again. A+,4
9287,the color was really good! but it was hard to squeeze to get the product out if you leave it somewhere cold it will harden=P,3
9288,"I bought 2 different styles of these nail wraps and both are pretty, but they're narrow and don't cover the nail horizontally.",2
9289,I will not buy again .I found them to not be user friendly .I am very dissapointed with this product,2
9290,"Does what it needs to, but it's a little tough to wash off your hands.",4
9291,Shipped fast looks nice 4stars cause the lid cover was broken when arrived. Other than that seems to be ok,4
9292,Didn't work on my tooth. Couldn't keep it on my gum around my tooth.,1
9293,"If you fall for this com, you deserve to get ripped off.",1
9294,It came broken. It didn't have the honey wax I was expecting. It was a pink wax.,2
9295,Works great for covering you gray roots between coloring roots again.,5
9296,Watertight cover to switch fell apart and shaver takes too long shaving under neck.,3
9297,"Very pretty... Size isn't comprable to scarves I buy from retail, but it looks nice!",3
9298,Looks great on my bathroom vanity next to my razor :),4
9299,Its doing good so far I highly prefer to have my own kit because of prices of tattoos . I love this item,5
9300,Good waterpik overall. Minus 1 star because the button on the handle sometimes get stuck. The newer WP-660 model replaced it with an on-off switch.,4
9301,Very pretty. Well packed/wrapped. Pretty peice for the cost,4
9302,"An excellent, well-made product.  I am happy with my purchase.",4
9303,received this item two months later then the date of delivery... the brush was ruined after one use and the nail glue was dried out,1
9304,I enjoyed the coverage and the ease of using it . I should have also purchased light to mix both together for a better match for skin,4
9305,Used one full bottle in about 3-4 weeks and i have not seen any results. This stuff really sucks. I do not recomend it.,1
9306,"These are ok. They will stick to your skin though, and aren't too absorbent.",3
9307,"This trimmer is awful. It pulled out my hair, made it thinner and has a horrible battery life. Do not buy this.",1
9308,PFPPColor is perfect. Just the right consistency and fair value.,5
9309,"feels great- makes your skin glow, and is a nice treat in the morning to spray on your face.  I also use their other lotion on top",5
9310,This is the perfect soap for anyone looking for chemical free soap or who has sensitive skin!!! You will not b disappointed!,5
9311,Much better than my old one and my wife likes the look of it.  Works well and is not too loud.,5
9312,These pills work very well for cleaning out the gall bladder and have saved my girlfriend from a needless surgery.,5
9313,"works amazing for my dry skin ! i always use it on my skin before i go to sleep :)
its a must buy !",5
9314,I bought it for my wife and she seems to love it.,4
9315,"While I received them on time, they are a very poor quality.  I can hardly cut any cuticles with these.  I am disappointed.  Barbara Berman",2
9316,great value for money but not so convenient process of refilling water (bulky). the design needs to be more efficient,4
9317,"These are so skinny, they won't hold half my hair.  Totally useless.",1
9318,Not very good quality. They don't apply my makeup as I had hoped. Better off using my fingers,1
9319,It's ok doesn't provide hair growth not for me at least but it helps with my daughter dandruff,2
9320,Number 28 is a pretty red color I will be ordering more for myself and as gifts,5
9321,I bought this for my cousin and she loves it!,5
9322,Its a very strange consistency and sticks in your blade - I have definitely gone through blades faster than before. Wouldn't buy it again.,2
9323,"Good quality and nice scent! A little pricey, but good product.",4
9324,"Lasted longer than I thought. But once it got a rip, I knew this kofi was no longer going to last. Very comfortable and stylish.",3
9325,I don't feel like wearing these makes much of a difference... They're ok...,3
9326,"Color is perfect! Powder stays on brush, so all goes to your cheeks.",5
9327,Kinda pricey.  But this is part of a nice electric tooth brush that keeps the kids interested in dental hygene.,4
9328,"Works great, narrow profile gets behind the knees and other areas really well. Recommend!",5
9329,"Counterfeit item. See picture, real Braun packaging on the left.",1
9330,I love this soap. I have really sensitive skin and this does not irritate it at all.,5
9331,"cleaning cartridges are difficult to find, so, to get them in a few days without having to go store to store is
terrific",4
9332,I have another of thier soap bowls. I am giving the bowl 2-stars as it arrived damaged and it is non-returnable.,2
9333,Has a weird flimy after taste that I don't like.  Otherwise does the job.,3
9334,Not very good quality and most bags came in wrinkled.  The ties broke on 25% of the bags.  Would not buy again.,2
9335,"it is too big need a 1/2 inch instead, use to get that size, now cannot find one",2
9336,This is the most offensive thing I've ever seen.,1
9337,I love this product.  Matte eye shadow is all about apply a little bit at a time.,4
9338,"A lot lighter than it looks in picture, but had no problem with return",3
9339,They turned out to be much longer than I thought.,3
9340,"This was a replacement for another one that I had, got old & would no longer work.  I'm pleased, heats up fast.",3
9341,"I use these every time I tan, work just fine & are better quality then the other pair I purchased actually at my salon.",4
9342,An absolute must. If I used this years ago I would still have all my teeth.,5
9343,"Good product, but will require cleaning every few weeks to prevent mold buildup",4
9344,"leaves a gross foam in your mouth and i lost my sense of taste, i can't detect salt!! horrible product!!",1
9345,I've gone through many of these razors and I must say they keep my face and body quite smooth. I'm but a beginner though.,5
9346,Easy to use.  My hair is on the shorter side so it works well but I doubt long hair would dry easily.,4
9347,The capsules are darker than usual and the taste is horrible.,1
9348,Shipped faster than I thought. Brushes are cute. No problems whatsoever. Great price!,4
9349,The sticky part came off after only having it on for a few minutes to try for size.,3
9350,"Works, but MUCH noisier than the last one I had.  Sounds like a machine gun.",2
9351,These do maintain the razor but they are over priced.,4
9352,"I was very disappointed with this knife, It was dull and would not cut. Don't waste your money.",1
9353,"This is a decent product, but you can get Tom's for kids at Target at a better price per ounce.",3
9354,The added stroage for tp is nice as it ensures you don't have to duck walk if the current roll runs out,4
9355,The cheapest material possible and black of course- looks like a rubber tire on a bike. Not even smooth rubber. Pasty. Cheap.,1
9356,This was for my 96 year old mother.  I didn't fit and came off when she slept.  May have been just too large.,3
9357,They arrived broken. It wasn't worth the hassle of returning.,1
9358,"Sturdy, easy-to-put-on, and effective. A longer middle piece for separation nearer ends of toes would be a welcome improvement.",4
9359,I bought it for my mum as she suffered from itch scalp and she liked it.,4
9360,"smells yuck, but it makes the face so smooth, its worth it",4
9361,Every recipe I have used this in has failed.  Not impressed.,2
9362,AWFUL! Does not work with liquid makeup at all!,1
9363,"Worked on some nails, not on others. Not sure what I did wrong. Maybe underlying coats were too thick?",3
9364,Hated this hairdryer.  It stopped working after 2 months.,1
9365,"Does a good job of hiding the gray between dying, but the stuff is expensive and the container is small.",4
9366,The motor that powers the trimmers was not powerful enough. When applying it the motor almost stops. Set it back for a full refund.,1
9367,Loved it and so did my son it has a very fresh scent and it definitely prevented lice,5
9368,Haven't tried these yet but they look way too big for my boobs!,2
9369,This product is a joke! It is a cheap piece of soft plastic. A rubber band could do the job better!,1
9370,"Love this!  Has saved having to color my roots every 2 weeks!  Plus the best, it fills in those thinning spots on scalp!!",4
9371,"A really good gentle cleanser. Always leaves my hair feeling clean, and soft. Also virtually eliminated dandruff issues where other bigger named products consistently failed.",5
9372,not that great. smells like peppermint but the scent doesn't seem to linger on the skin.,2
9373,Product is what I was looking for in a flosser. I dislike the noisy pump and the wrong power supply voltage.,4
9374,There ok nothing to special. I really like the pink case it comes with though.,3
9375,"Started using a few weeks ago and with excercise I have noticed results, will buy again.",5
9376,"It works but gives me break outs every single day, after using it for almost 2 months.",3
9377,"Love using this cleaner. If you use and then don't have access to it, you really miss using it for sure!!",4
9378,I received my order and NONE of the packages had any patches in them. Requested refund.,1
9379,If you're on accutane you will want this for your entire face!,5
9380,"Very cheap, feel like it will shatter if it falls out of my hand. Seller shipped quickly and no complaints with them though!",3
9381,It was time to replenish my supply and it came quick and shipped properly! I love rosewater and this line is the cheapest and most reliable.,5
9382,Great product for that all day lift but on the expensive side. For the same effect I would suggest the got-to-be glued version at half the cost.,3
9383,"These smell very different than the sticks by same manufacturer.  A lot more ""soapy"" and less ""creamy.""
They are a bit overwhelming.",3
9384,Good product - I replaced my old Phillips with this one and am very satisfied.,4
9385,"its good for mattyfing the skin, even in humid weather",4
9386,Really cute but was a different material than I expected it to be. I think it's satin.,4
9387,Excellent.  Color does not stain face.  It does not smell.  It is permanent.,5
9388,"Not working for me, but it might work for someone else and I know it did for a few people I know.",3
9389,The lipstick is great but it smells a bit weird. I hope that's normal :/,5
9390,Love this body wash!! My absolute favorite! And very hard to find.,5
9391,These eyeliners are honestly very crappy and have no pigment at all! They are like trying to use crayons!,2
9392,"REALLY love this lotion! Great smell, goes on smooth, and really hydrates my skin.",5
9393,Wasn't crazy about my first oil I opened but the rest I liked.,4
9394,I LOVE these noes studs they are amazing for a small nose,5
9395,"Came quickly. Brand new and as pictured. I gave 4 stars because the brushes smell like glue, but smell wears off.",4
9396,"OK, so I feel a little picky when I use it. But if this is a bad product, I'm all wet!!!",4
9397,"Takes a little time to get everything even, but works well.",4
9398,The machine is very good just a wax is Sticker i bought another wax from gigi,4
9399,"Horrible! These gloves are so small, they are toddler size!",1
9400,I used this for awhile I think it's not authentic since I bought the stores's bb cream and get better results.,4
9401,Very well crafted and aesthetically pleasing product.  Very satisfied customer,5
9402,"This product does not work, the charging light never endsand battery charge does not work, can get my money back?",1
9403,Bottles received but NO REUSABLE cotton pouches received!  What am I to use to store these beads?!?,4
9404,Very hard to keep on and uncomfortable to wear. You CANNOT return this item if you don't like it.,1
9405,I have long color-treated hair and the argon oil improves the brittle tips.,4
9406,Size and colors were great however there was only one shape,4
9407,Beautiful and functional so I'm very pleased and a fair price.,5
9408,This made my head itchy. A friends kids had lice and I felt extra paranoid so ordered this to use before going there.,2
9409,I thought that this was the Oil of Love Body Oil still very nice scented and has quanities that it claims to have,3
9410,I like the covered it gives. It just doesn't last and by the mid day it leaves my skin feeling very oily.,3
9411,just a piece of plastic. didn't work on me.,1
9412,Dind't like that is very dry on my lips. The color is pretty.,3
9413,Beautiful Wig.  Looks more expensive than it was.  Love it.,5
9414,AWful. Blade did not even stay connected in the razor.,1
9415,have not used these as with my long hair I see no use or value ...maybe good for a child,1
9416,"The product was great, but the bag it was in was old and torn.",4
9417,Very cheap brushes that she's all over the place one of which actually completely lost all of the hair without any use don't bother,1
9418,The worst setting spray Ive ever used. Its sticky it burns and it leaves blotches on my face.,1
9419,This product did not do anything. I use it as directed with plastic wrap! Totally shame! Do not waste your money!!,1
9420,"haven't seen the changes, guess it is slow improvement.",3
9421,"It's okay, good deal for the price but you get what you pay for.  The stand is heavy but it looks cheap to me",3
9422,You get what you paid for. It's easy to use. Less irritation. I would recommend this product.,4
9423,My husband received this as a gift.  He traded it for a waterproof model.  Too time consuming he said.  Other than that a good product.,2
9424,It doesn't smell like mandarin! Other bar soaps from Seventh Generation smell better than this one.,1
9425,"Positives: Quiet. Charge lasts two weeks.
Negatives: No major weaknesses. But the cutting performance is only good, not great.",4
9426,ordered hq 55 as pictured and came hq 56. boy can;t trust anybody any more just will buy offline at walmart or so.,1
9427,"They wete all silver and gold, no colors. :(",3
9428,Bottom tray did not always adhere to teeth. Tended to collapse and not hold its shape. Did lighten teeth.,3
9429,it fall s off the toilet easily when trying to get on it if you are handicap,1
9430,Thank goodness they went back to the longer bristles. Much better! The last one I bought was a disappointment. Love this one.,5
9431,This replacement for the 2 in 1 is a major disappointment.,2
9432,Very watery... it does hold tho once u can get it on,2
9433,Great quality  cimb period. You'll  feel  the difference.,4
9434,Fit true to size. Very cool with mesh on back! Would recommend to anyone!,5
9435,It's okish......i would buy this if i had to protect my nails.,3
9436,WORKS GREAT I HAVE USED IT FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS  IT REALLY HELPS GET A BETTER SHAVE.,4
9437,I use this every day  I live on the gulf coast of Florida and this is the only sun protection I use,5
9438,"I liked it, I always prefer natural products I don't use toothpaste I don't like the fluoride that's it good",4
9439,Covers pretty well but I don't like is the feel of my hair with it on there.  I will purchase it again.,4
9440,"Hard to glue on, fall off easily, doesn't come with glue. These are very okay. Cheap tho so can't really complain!",2

9445,"too loud.
it sounds like the motor is going to explode.
I'm not sure how long it's going to last.",2
9446,Blends in well and does not show any appearance it is there. but after several days helped skin tone and overall consistency of skin color,4
9447,I have not noticed any results in the passes 2 weeks as mentioned by other supposed customers... Don't waist your money.,1
9448,"Holds my razor and brush nicely. Looks good, nice quality.",5

9453,"Smells wonderful. Feels great on hands and arms, etc.",5
9454,"It was not for me, therefore I can not rate it.",3
9455,Great for pores but definitely dries skin out. I've taken to selectively using it only on problem areas to minimize drying.,3

9461,"I read that colorless iodine helps problem fingernails.  I've been using it for a few weeks now, but have not yet noticed any improvement..",2
9462,This stuff is really amazing on  tooth pain. I wouldn't try it on an infant but we use it while waiting to get to the dentist.,5
9463,The stand looks great and feels sturdy.  Fits my blade and brush perfectly.,5
9464,The product works fine but the bristles are a bit stiff and I wished it were possible to get softer bristles.,4
9465,They had a plastic smell and aren't good for blending eyeshadow. They also don't wash well. Wont buy again.,2
9466,Inferior to the older model with square water holder. Why was it abandoned? It should be brought back. The redesign is not better.,4
9467,"Love it.  My dental hygienist recommended I get and I haven't missed a day using it, so easy and better than flossing.",5
9468,"I bought these years ago and loved then, Has the formulas changed? It did not do the VERY nice job it did in the past",4
9469,"Completely died after only five or six uses, and wouldn't power up again at all.  I'm not at all impressed.",1

9472,Derma e has some if the best products for skincare at a reasonable price!! I use them exclusively!!!,5
9473,It has a nice shine. It is cheap looking jewelry but you can't tell from afar and is perfect for one time use or costume wear.,3
9474,This is very flimsy and has trouble even staying on my refrigerator... better to spend a few more dollars and get one at walmart...,1
9475,Love the Idea of the attached flap to help hold separator in place but the separator itself is not soft enough to add any comfort relief,2
9476,I wouldn't buy this product again. It keep slipping off my head.,2
9477,I shouldn't have ordered this.  I wanted a lighter colour and this colour gets darker as the day goes on.  I would not order again.,3
9478,"Well, I had gone around places searchin for a reasonalbly cheap trimmer. This product indeed is the lowest price you can get in the market.",5
9479,Haven't tried it on yet but it looks pretty good for the price.,5
9480,I used it once. It works. I don't have much else to say yet. I'll come back if I have any issues,5
9481,"As mentioned in other reviews, the black paint rubs off of the blades, but they cut well and feel good in the hand.",3
9482,"A very good product, except that the housing is very thin plastic.  It needs to be handled with care. It does everything as advertised.",4
9483,Not as big around as I thought they would be from the looks of the pic but pretty nice in all,4
9484,very nice bows .The hold a large puck of soap just right,5
9485,"Color way off for me, thought would be more pink than beige.",3
9486,"Did not meet expectations at all.  Pockets too small, craftsmanship poor.",1
9487,Dullist razor blade I've ever used. Buy Feather brand if you want a true razor sharp blade.,1
9488,Too slimy for my liking. Seems like petroleum jelly.,2
9489,It's been a good groomer taking care of my grooming needs.,4
9490,I have a chronic sinus infection that would become acute 3-4 times a year.  Using this nasal wash daily pretty much eliminates the problem.,5
9491,Some of the bristle was falling out the first time I used it .,3
9492,This oil caused an itchy rash on my skin.  I do not usually have sensitivity so I was surprised.,1
9493,Very helpful in healing my tattoo up. My artist recommended this product and my new tattoo healed quickly.,5
9494,Not very soft or satin feel.  Very thin.  Large size tho.,4
9495,Rosallini Silver Tone Metal Round Handle Pedicure File Trimmer Nail Clipper is okay.  Will do for what I want it for.,3
9496,FINALLY got the size I wanted!  THANKS!!  IT IS GREAT!!,4
9497,Love my make-up completely happy with it and was delivered earlier then said,4
9498,Smell is not my favorite. My girls didn't care for it either.,2
9499,"I AM PLEASED WITH THE PRODUCT----IT DOES THE JOB I BOUGHT IT FOR.

Philips Norelco 7140XL Cord/Cordless Rechargeable Shaver (Purchased on 09/06/2007)",3
9500,"I like the fact that it is small/compact
but wish it was more powerful.
My old waterpik was too big but flow of water was much stronger.",4
9501,They don't stick at all! They're also way too small.,1
9502,"Not bad but it could have had better vacuum, or at least it could have sucked in hair better. Over all it was decent.",3
9503,The razor was straight awful a waste of money.you shouldn't even sell this on your site pure crap,1
9504,Best feminine wash I have used so far since the brand that I'm used to is not available in local pharmacy.,4
9505,"It looks cute in your hair, but it broke apart the 2nd time I tried to put it in.  Pretty cheap design.",1
9506,"They whiten OK, but are difficult to work with, particularly the bottom.  While the results are mixed, I wouldn't purchase them again.",3
9507,"great little trimmer! Isn't very loud, does not snag hairs!",5
9508,it does what it suppose to do - flosses your teeth. Very easy to use and teeth feel great. I definitely recommend this product.,5
9509,Doesn't have that little shimmer that the first bottle had.,2
9510,As advertised. Does a very good job cleaning up those little nicks.,4
9511,Love this shade. Glides on smooth. Very little goes a long way! I will always buy this brand from now on!,5
9512,"Nice looking, heavy,  but be careful that you get a brush that fits or can modify your brush handle to fit",4
9513,It's a relaxing bath that leaves you feeling differently afterwards. Be careful with the powder. It chokes you if gets in the air,4
9514,"This product gives my S-wavy curls great definition without being crunchy or looking like they have too much ""goop"" on them.

Witchy",4
9515,I like it but it can be very streaky if you are not careful with it. so it can be a bit difficult to apply.,3
9516,"Unfortunately, it has no effect, good for nothing.",1
9517,I much prefer the sister products 'My Chocolate Starfish'  and 'My Purple Helmet'. This really is poss poor on comparison .,1
9518,"Since having foot surgery, these help keep them separated and toe wraps keep them in place.",5
9519,Got a hole in the back of it after two uses.,3
9520,Very watery. Completely different consistency from what we see when we purchase from Target or Walmart. Safety seal was also broken. Will not be using.,1
9521,Very softening. Wish the aroma would linger a little longer.,5
9522,Does not work. I have been wearing this for weeks but my penis is not getting a tan. And it is a bit uncomfortable.,1
9523,It is working OK for me. I do like that I can remove the spokes and clean the barrell. It does heat up quite quickly,4
9524,"My blood levels lessoned when I switched to this product.
I will switch back.",2
9525,love this cream makes my skin feel amazing.. and I love the smell.. it reminds me of old memories with my grandma very comforting smell..,5
9526,"They were worth a try... but, as I had worried, they lose hairs too much.",1
9527,didn't order it and ticked off it came to my house!,1
9528,"Some of the brushes are low quality, but I've had this set for almost 2 years and it's still holding up!",4
9529,"Been using this product for over a year.  Liked it so much, bought it for my father as a Christmas present.",5
9530,If you have crooked teeth like me - be alert - it really doesn't work because the strips won't stay on the whole 1/2 hour.,1
9531,"Pretty wimpy.  Not hot enough, not better than hair dryer and brush.  Still looking for a winner.",2
9532,I expected better results.  At least as good as dental floss. So far I am disappointed with the results. bnot as good as expected.,2
9533,thx for this its great but i don't know what else to say too many words. ok ok ok ok..,4
9534,Brush doesn't work very well so I had to order a  higher end brush but the acrylic was good,3
9535,"This product was a waste of money,  try ultra bond.  It was thin and dripped down her face.",1
9536,Good for use dry before a shower or in the shower. Arrived promptly.,4
9537,This is a gift for my manager. Their family love it so much! I will purchase again! thanks so much,5
9538,I have thick hair. This product helps control the frizz and does wonders with my straightener.,5
9539,I don't do my makeup often but they're pretty.,4
9540,I have wide spaced teeth from having had braces and this is a fantastic floss for me.  If you have wide spaced teeth try this floss,5
9541,Most of thet gems were misplaced and every one had the black cushion stuck to it.,3
9542,"It is excelent for styling the hair. It is easy yo use, i am happy with it. I recomiend it for all women",4
9543,This is a good product.  I would recommend this to friends/family.,5
9544,Doesnt work at all! Dont waste your money!!,1
9545,"The application is very soft and the color is lovely, I was expecting a little more stronger tone, but I like it anyway :D",4
9546,Worked well before recharge.  Useless after the first recharge.,2
9547,"Love this waterpik.  Only lasts about a year or two, but still like it. This is our third one.",4
9548,"Wearing these goggles was like wearing no goggles in the tanning bed... So bright, felt like there was no protection",1
9549,"This is a great little machine, not quite as strong as my old water pick
and the storage department for extra picks is just ok",3
9550,Not as great as I imagined. I've used other brands before that worked better.,2
9551,Doesn't work at all and if you have a toothache you are better off trying to find some clove oil instead.,1
9552,"It's a decent cheap brush set. Nothing special, but it gets the job done.",5
9553,Not a great product for bikini trimmer. I got it wet in the first week and it died instantly.,2
9554,Very good quality and price of kid's flossers. I just wish they had an unflavored variety to avoid artificial flavors. These are still pretty good.,4
9555,It's good but it started peeling within a couple hours.,4
9556,Very average product. Smell is ok but quite weak. Also the cream is way too runny. Works fine though and doesnt dry the skin.,3
9557,"Good for taking out bulk, but still doesn't get close enough or even enough for me. I need something more for side burns.",3
9558,"Only lasted 3 hours before the the adhesive stopped working, I found the shield hang at the bottom of my shirt",3
9559,The product seems to work. I can't give any revelations or huge testaments to it though.,4
9560,"soft and clean up all body. can use bar or liquid soap, feel so clean after bath. and also long life",4
9561,These were a gift for my son. He loves them. They are a thicker sock and of good quality.,4
9562,Does not lather well and have not noticed a difference in my hair,3
9563,I like that it goes on more or less easily and won't run to the children's eyes but the smell is terrible.,3
9564,This product works exactly as expected. Smells great and doesn't leave a yucky residue on your hair. Also works as a detangeler,5
9565,My Boars Bristle brush is too big to fit in this ... be warned,3
9566,Very disappointed.  The wig doesn't completely cover the hair.  I can't ship it back to China so I'm stuck.,1
9567,Too expensive and uselless attachments. I just wanted a simple flosser,3
9568,"works great to moisturize but my face breaks out.  I have sensitive skin, might not bother everyone.",3
9569,I use this as my evening skin serum.  It has helped improve the appearance of my complexion.,4
9570,The only problem is that hair tends to stick to the area that is applied! Sticky,4
9571,"I like the smell, soft and not so strong. It doesn't work as good as I expected. it's an ok product.",3
9572,Loved the coverage. This color ended up being too light for me.,4
9573,"Good quality scissors for the money. I'm not a professional, I just cut my son's hair and have used these for two years.",5
9574,Good facial cream but not heavy enough for my skin. I mix this cream with the Mad Hippie Antioxidant Oil and it works great.,4
9575,These are very ideal when a woman goes to the nail salon. Excellent and I use them every time I go.,5
9576,"barely sticks to clothing, ends up bunched and then unattached",1
9577,This product seems old. I've purchased this product before and the consistency is different.,1
9578,Thank you for the comments. I was going this product thanks for saving. I don't going to buy this product thanks again!!!,1
9579,"I really like them, awesome product. The shipping was very quick. I was surprised.",5
9580,"Perfect size, and they're easy to remove and clean without causing pain. The colors are bright as well very cute",4
9581,making my skin dry and fucjing the oil . Ud better not use it day by day,4
9582,Too bulky with no battery. I much prefer the small portable one I purchased. It also has a battery.,3
9583,My daughter loved this present for her birthday. As soon as she opened it she dressed her Dollie,5
9584,"This product has done all that a beard trimmer should do. Good battery, sharp cutter. I would recommend to a friend",4
9585,Works like expected.  Wish we didn't have to write X number of words when three can do the trick. ok,5
9586,Works well with razor and brush combo.  Nice weighted base too.  Nothing fancy but quite useful for storing the razor and brush in-between uses.,4
9587,"ordered the product, which is difficult to find in stores anymore, received it very quickly! Amazon does a great job, and I love this product",4
9588,Didn't glow maybe like the first time I got them but didn't glow.. /:,1
9589,"Excellent product with a great scent. However,the scent declines as the day goes on.
I still would recommend this product.",4
9590,I liked the almond scent and the way it cleaned our clothes and us on the river!  The fact that is nature friendly was what was required.,4
9591,"What a super deal.  Wouldve had 5 Stars but the containers aren't easy to open at all.  For the price, who really cares :)",4
9592,Does the job well. Does what it was made for.,4
9593,It fit my tablet just the way I wanted a case to fit. Have no complaints. Would buy again if needed,4
9594,"Works well, just didn't expect so much spray all over my bathroom counter when doing my front teeth.",4
9595,"Items received was opn and seem as if they were filled with oil. Also, appeared as if it was used already and then sent to me",1
9596,"yellow/ red light need blue for makeup mirror :( , fyi blue is hard to find in this size for some reason",1
9597,I'm still experimenting using the plastic wrap 'technique'.,4
9598,"First time trying this brand of lipstick, I love the colour. And I would buy again.",5
9599,I found the waterpik ultra too large compared to the apprearance in the internet. And it makes a lot of noise.,3
9600,The tint is well matte and is very pigmented. It was a bit of a long wait however.,4
9601,This product works well for dry and chapped feet. It leaves my feet super soft!,4
9602,Unfortunately it is quite too small. Like. I had a regular 14 gauge liprings and this was like a needle going thru :(,2
9603,"The label says its water + rose water essential oil.  This is NOT rose water, nor is it digestable.  AVOID!",1
9604,"Found it hard to find something as much as I like Cranley Clinic creams, but this does the trick.",4
9605,"Works well, although haven't had much use for most of the attachments.",4
9606,I am still using the cream and have not had any positive compliments as yet but I see great changes,4
9607,These are cheaply made! They broke the first time I used them! The lenses fell out while on! It was a waste of my money!,1
9608,The spray was awful. The color way to dark.,1
9609,"Maybe it's me, but I think these hold an edge longer than stainless",5
9610,Dont use as a belt it doesn't hold on but makes a great neclace,3
9611,"good for people with sensitive ears, just wish there were cuter ones!",3
9612,I had to add more lemon to this bc the tea tree was a bit overwhelming. Smelled a bit medical but hey some folks like that scent.,4
9613,"It doesn't work that well.
Very bad design.",1
9614,Prefer the pump because my kids don't make as big a mess. Bought the 6 pack b/c its the only option I could find.,4
9615,"Very cute and as described, but broke before I even put it in my hair which was disappointing.",2
9616,"It is cute and gives you an idea of what it would look like, but when you breathe through your nose if falls off.",1
9617,Hate it. I ordered two different ones and both of them would fold over in my purse and would not hold the items.,1
9618,"Clean with no fragrance,  the pastilles melted easily. I can see these as an improvement over my former brand. excellent!",5
9619,thank you - didn't notice much effect on my white hair!,4
9620,grandaughter who uses it in school drama class said it was o.k.,3
9621,"I bought this for my girlfriend, but she never used it. Otherwise it seems like its pretty amazing!",4
9622,"This waterpik makes a huge noise.

 I don't recommend this product.",1
9623,The bags have no closure to hold the soap in.  Want a refund.  Very bad product.,1
9624,"Great concept and design, but you can actually get this cheaper at Wal-mart. I should have shopped around.",3
9625,"Verdict still out on this one, not sure yet, as wear it on top of vCserum.....",3
9626,Color matches perfect. Well done ' Elastic is a bit small so I have to use an elastic first then put the scrunch or on.,3
9627,"There is nothing special about the shaving heads, they are what they are, no more, no less.",4
9628,"It is not what I was expecting, is a chip imitation of the original",2
9629,Not super powerful but it's delicate and works pretty good. Prepare to use another razor in the shower though,4
9630,I picked 218 and I was so excited and it was FAKE and the foundation came out white. Very disappointed,1
9631,"Good razors, though I would say every  1/10 or so is a dud",4
9632,"A purchase that has saved me plenty on blades, but has increased my spending on fine, vintage safety razors and accessories.",4
9633,"Color is white not ivory or off white. It's functional and good to heal my dry hands.
Easy to wash.",4
9634,Super cute product but mine came with the big stone off.. i just glued it n now its fyn..,3
9635,Great to have a super sharp fresh blade whenever you need it.,4
9636,"I bought it for my daughter, she apparently loves the set.",5
9637,I look forward to my evening bath partly because of this shower gel.  I love the smell and how it makes my skin feel.,5
9638,"Don't love the water splashing everywhere but perhaps I'll get used to it eventually. Does the job it's supposed to do, however.",3
9639,"The wax was not wax but probably was some synthetic cement, horrible experience. Never again...",1
9640,I have tried it twice - it makes it better - I wouldn't say it was amazing...,3
9641,i quickly noticed it results probably because i have very dry skin,4
9642,"Picture shown is different than the bottle what we received. Name is same,however.",3
9643,Polish chips too fast for my liking and that is even with a top coat on it.,3
9644,It's a great product. Looks nice and fits the dcor of most bathrooms.,5
9645,"This is the version with Elvis on the packaging, not the classic packaging.",3
9646,"Ridiculously tiny. Probably my mistake. I thought I would decorate Christmas ornaments with them but no, they're way too small.",1
9647,Not 10 days yet.. but already seeing results. Looks like my lashes are fuller and longer already. Would buy again.,5
9648,"delivery was super fast, this is  my favorite soap , great smell and cleans super awesome.. try it you'll like it. guaranteed.. and it's cheap",5
9649,"So sticky

Edit- works well if you wait a minute before applying and only apply minimum amount.",4
9650,"the system unit Is very noisy and cheaply made in my opinion, i've seen better made units many years ago",1
9651,thick .. not comfortable .. very dark and matte in not a good way,2
9652,It was okay but WAY too expensive for what it did.,3
9653,"this just feels like water, doesn't do anything, don't waste your money; the vitamin C serum is better",1
9654,It broke down after a year. Don't buy.,3
9655,It's good but I don't like the smell  I do recommend this product though because it does what is said,3
9656,Happy with replacement Clean and renew.  Received in timely manner.,3
9657,Very cute stars are not as crisp but I still love it,4
9658,not the best dried my hair out. glad I only bought the starter kit.,3
9659,"it is simply as it is described,
the wrap is of good quality and it was carefully packed,
i would definitely recommend it to others",4
9660,Doesn't work to hold wigs down. It just makes a sticky mess. Pretty much worthless for my purposes.,1
9661,"Did not work at all - product was melted and didn't spread, only clumped together. Would not purchase again.",1
9662,"Works perfectly well, lights aren't uncomfortable to see trough.",5
9663,"I am pleased at the Norelco Razor, it is quiet and effecient.  Comfortable ant quick.  Would recommend it to friends.",4
9664,"It is mild, foams well, is minty, does the job. Purchased the watermelon flavor too. Will definitely be purchasing this again",5
9665,"Done with bottle and I see no difference , really disappointed :( . I put on twice a day and it didn't work",1
9666,It covers beautifully but it broke off on second use so very frustrating to use right now,1
9667,Best floss ever.  Glides through the teeth effortlessly. Does not break or cut your gums. I will only use this floss from here on out.,5
9668,I am very diapponted. It is ver difficult to open the clasp. It doesn't open enough to grasp fabric. Completely worthless to me..,1
9669,"The cup leaked after a couple of months, causing discoloration of the granite counter top under it.",3
9670,It's okay but rarely used. I rub coconut oil on me instead.,3
9671,Best product ever use ...just love it too much already done with 3 bottles running on my 4th,5
9672,"Dynarex is a great brand. if you buy this from BP Medical you will get a cheap Chinese off brand, NOT Dynarex.

Stay away from them",3
9673,It gets the job done but pulls at hair if you aren't directly on skin. It isn't loud so that's good,4
9674,It doesn't grab my hair so it's kind of useless!,1
9675,Over priced..... Still had problems with chemicals in it but could be just me.... Buy at your own risk.... May like it,3
9676,This is the second one we have purchased. It works well and does the job advertised.,4
9677,I love it... could tell a huge difference in a few days!,5
9678,haven't noticed anything magic.... everyone else loves it but didn't do anything for me,3
9679,smells AWFUL really synthetic 1st time i opened it it made my head hurt ALL DAY. theres NO almond oil only almond fragrance...,1
9680,WORKS LIKE THE REST I HAVE OWNED.  THIS ONE IS QUIETER THAN MY OLDER MODEL AND CUTS A BIT BETTER.,4
9681,"It's really nice but some of embellishment had fell off.  Needless to say, it's cute!",4
9682,Easier to use and works better than Vaseline. Good product for tough and rough skin.,4
9683,Great coverage.  awesome  colors . The tubs are a little  small to work with but so far love it,4
9684,"Looks nice, brush holds on well but not the shaver. Husband uses Gillette",4
9685,Best feminine wash I have used so far since the brand that I'm used to is not available in local pharmacy.,4
9686,I don't like false advertising. Seller pictured the jar of manic panic color and it was actually the bottle.,1
9687,"Good product, but the label of the bottle wouldn't stay.",4
9688,"Did not work at all. Waste of money in my opinion. I used apple cider vinegar with mother, that got rid of my black head.",1
9689,"I tested the product for two weeks and I did not find any result

Skin color is still the same, and it showed no improvement",2
9690,"There was no heat or power to this ""hair drier"". Don't waste your money",1
9691,A co-worker referred me to the Waterpik and I have to say that I works great. My dentist was amazed at the difference,5
9692,Left scars on my skin not too comfortable :/ broke after I wore it 3 times from the bands,1
9693,these razors left me little cuts all over my legs idk why. also gave me terrible razor burn. never buying these again.,1
9694,the battery goes dead. I have to keep the cord plugged in. it works good with the cord plugged in.,3
9695,I like Clubman stuff but this simply wasn't my favorite.,3
9696,"my son was not impressed,, I bought it once and never buy it again,,,,",1
9697,"I bought the new 5 blader from Gillette, but went back to this one. More is not nessesarily better",4
9698,Nice product not as many big ones as I wanted but it's not bad for the price.,4
9699,Great product the only thing is I was missing a lid on the bottom jar. Other than that love the product.,4
9700,"Good product and quick charge, does a good job for not a lot of money, that we need to save.",4
9701,I've been alternating using this device along with flossing.  It does a good job keeping plaque off my teeth and loosening stuff caught between them.,4
9702,The glasses came with only Eye protectors....no band to keep on your head...are you kidding me? Seriously disappointed,1
9703,"This is perfect in many ways, fragrant, light, and clean.",5
9704,Everything about the razor and the transaction worked out very well,5
9705,This was great to send as a gift.  Served the purpose well.  Would recomend Norelco to anyone interested in an electric shaver.,4
9706,"Was expecting to get an ugly color since ""they choose color""  I received a
cute pair of purple!",4
9707,Love the way it works on my arms and legs - getting old skin off. I am so glad we finally found something.,4
9708,"you can't marveled with this polish nail, the drops sung. very nice colors do",2
9709,"No need for the vibration. Takes a lot of time and work to buff hair off, especially if it's any bit coarse.",3
9710,It is just fine.  And the price was good.,5
9711,"been using it fro a while was prescriped by my doctor,",5
9712,I's expecting the bottle to be made of glass(as it was some 50 years ago) this is why not 5 stars!,4
9713,"Quiet compared to a whal I had owned, many attachments although it seems a little slow cutting but nice for the price",4
9714,"These are among the best razors I have used, and while they may not be as fine as Feather razors they certainly provide a fantastic everyday close shave",5
9715,Works great for hair thats thin.  Wish Walgreens kept it on the shelf.,5
9716,"it is a good cream but it is not the best cream I ever used, it has nice texture, do the joob",4
9717,These covers were perfect for my kids. They are very basic so easy for them to get the tablet in and out of the cover.,4
9718,Works well wish it lasted longer.seems to loose adhesion after 2 weeks..,4
9719,Wife liked it but said she didn't to buy more.,3
9720,"I prefer a to wear little darker.  Easy to apply, but need to reapply often.",3
9721,I used this probably twice before the stick just fell out of the tube.,2
9722,"Expensive, fake looking, and hard to control. Do not recc",1
9723,Pretty moisturizing but a little more pink tones than I would like,4
9724,purchased for someone as a gift as they were considering cosmetology. still works well even though she changed here career,4
9725,I like this soap because it makes your body clean without make it dry,4
9726,These were very soft they were just as I expected them to be they get the job done.,3
9727,"Shaves pretty well, holds a nice charge and gets the job done",4
9728,"Good for dental flossing for implants, it's strong and is a very good bargain at 30 per box for daily flossing.",4
9729,"This is a very good product and works very well for multiple trim levels even very short not quit shaven smoot, but good.",4
9730,It's a very soft scrub - you can barely feel the beads. Otherwise nice.,4
9731,It's an oil and not a mist like it states. I already have oil. Thanks a lot amazon,1
9732,NOT WORTH THE MONEY. THE GEL FILLS THE JAR ABOUT 1/3 FULL.,1
9733,"Its not Noisey, its powerful,well though out nozzles!",5
9734,I had bought some like this before. Very comfortable.,4
9735,Have a tooth that has a little root exposed at the gumline. Been about a month & no pain yet!,5
9736,"Nice pure soap but, its drying to my skin.",4
9737,Its a metal stand. It's priced right. What can go wrong?,3
9738,It has now been a couple of months and this still ha made no difference. Not at all impressed for what it's advertised for...,1
9739,For the price you really cant ask for more they are oversized for my cpap but easily cut to match with scissors,4
9740,"Unit motor is giving out in less than 2 years - poor product!
Purchased this in Feb of 2015.",2
9741,Absolute waste of money.  Will not stay stuck in the long term.,1
9742,It broke literally the first time I tried to put it in my hair.,2
9743,I have bought better but this one is still very good for its price.,4
9744,I have a very sensitive skin and thought these would be kinder to my skin. I was wrong. They are kinda doll.,2
9745,"It's a bit noisy, other than that, it's a good product, I am using it everyday and it became my daily routine now",4
9746,"it is my first electric shaver.it works well . it's easy to use,and gives a good shave. i'm pleased with this product.",4
9747,Chains break easily. Caps don't hold pen well. Pen often falls off my hospital badge.,2
9748,Shaves much quicker than anything I've used.  It has a hard time getting a couple spots on my face though.,4
9749,Works well for removing oils and dirt. Great for blackheads. Leaves face feeling clean and fresh without being over dry or oily. Highly recommend.,4
9750,Try it.  It holds and leaves shine without being sticky even though it's called sticky business. Amazing control and look,5
9751,These are great when it's time to replace. Like that they come in packs of multiples. I do my wife's feet with these.,4
9752,"A great pillow, but the color is not a match.  It is nice to never recline on a cold plastic surface.",4
9753,love this brush perfect for mid length hair I use mine every day ! No more hair dryer needed for me,5
9754,Saves so much time to add a little curl at the same time as drying.,4
9755,Great product! Glad to be able to purchase it on Amazon after it was discontinued by its company. Thanks!,4
9756,"it is softer, but it gets all tangled up in it's self!",3
9757,"not a fan of the soap, due to the smell and harshness of the soap. the soap got into my eyes and caused severe irritation.",3
9758,It is such a good color but is not lasting and does not get absorbed. I recommend it for the color,3
9759,Great product!  This is a wonderful addition to any dopp kit to keep your face lettuce looking sharp.,5
9760,A friend told me that we could get this item on line as we hadn't been able to find it locally.  It's great.,4
9761,Ordered this on accident but tried it anyway. Make me look greasy and sweat more,1
9762,I've been using H&S for a long time and I'm very happy with it. The entire purchase experience was great.,4
9763,"I thought it would come in the red or blue color, but I received 4 ugly grey colors.  Not impressed.",2
9764,"I really haven't used this brush that much, but I am satisfied the times I have used it!",5
9765,"It is nice, but as nice as it is somehow it doesn't smell like the cologne does.  I'll try something else the next time.",4
9766,Works very well in trimming long hairs that my electric shaver misses. Works well in trimming nasal hair. I highly recommend the Norelco G370.,5
9767,"Like all Waterpik products the water squirts around, but it works.",4
9768,My third Norelco over 40 years...they just keep making them better. This one will likley out live me. But maybe not,5
9769,I really like this cream.  You don't need a full pump either.  The smell well..... it could use some improvements.,4
9770,"Smells good.  Works well!  A little greasy and does seem to ""stain"" your skin a bit until you wash it off.",4
9771,"Not much power and brush gets caught in hair, unlike the one I had formerly",1
9772,I love this product. It helps your body produce its own HGH and helps you feel more vibrant and energetic!,5
9773,"It's okay and I like it. However, it is cheaply made.",4
9774,"The color is super light, you can barely see it. My lips feel soft and goes on easy",3
9775,"This fragrence smelled horrible, it makes it difficult to breathe. May work for some people, I have Asthma so am very sensitive to strong scents.",1
9776,You can't beat the price. It's a great choker.,5
9777,Not even had it  year and it is rusting. Unhappy! It does not get wet.,1
9778,I love it. Use it every time I shampoo. The best there is. Also other products work well too.,1
9779,"Gave to granddaughter for Christmas.
After couple of uses. The brush fell in two pieces.
Not recommend.",3
9780,I have a chronic lung condition and I could tell a positive difference in the first week I took it.,5
9781,Adds body and shine.  I like the fragrance and feel of the product.,4
9782,"A little difficult to use, but practice makes perfect.",4
9783,I love these bath gloves. They have a great feel and exfoliate wonderfully!,5
9784,"rip off!!!
wrrrrrrrrrr

guys do not be fooled by the price, at walmart you get that way cheaper - 4.60$",1
9785,"I have not been using it long enough to see if it makes a difference for me, but it was highly recommended by a nutritionist I consulted.",4
9786,I used these in a blazer and they come off halfway through the day.  Will try them again on other garments but so far no success.,3
9787,"Very nice, however, one issue the claps are very hard to open and someone with arthritis might have a difficult time opening the claps.",4
9788,Love this little thing it's perfect it comes with a little travel case can't live without it my husband even tries to use it LOL!,4
9789,Awesme to get in a four pack - came as expected and faster than expected! I will definitely place this  same order again when I run out!,5
9790,The price was great but the stone r so chip u get want u pay for sorowkis r way better,1
9791,I worked at this company years ago and fell in love with this scent!  Loving it!,5
9792,not silk! this is polyester which is absolutely horrible for your hair especially when trying to get waves!,1
9793,I like this lotion after swimming. My skin is not getting dried out. The smell is very nice.,4
9794,It doesn't get rid of anything & it smells like candle wax.,1
9795,Very rancid. Bought for lip balm. Not putting this anywhere near my mouth.,1
9796,I really love this shampoo.  It only takes a small amount and it always leaves my hair looking healthy and clean.,5
9797,"Pretty good detangling spray. It smells really nice, but I feel like you have to use a lot to really get it to work.",4
9798,"not happy with the shave,so they sit in the closet",2
9799,I am a regular use of this product and must use it because of the closeness of  my teeth.  Glide is for me,4
9800,It's OK...may have to update the review after using it a little.,3
9801,water down....do different from the others I have. same brands,1
9802,Seems to do its job well.  like the adjustment for power.  Have not used all the attachments that came with it.,4
9803,its very good to get this product with the green tea ingredients will be so nice to my face thanks,4
9804,"Great price, great delivery, and works much better than my old water pic.",5
9805,"I found what I needed. I ordered, it arrived. It works as expected. No problems.",4
9806,"I like these brushes , It took a little while to get here but that's okay",4
9807,Beautiful shimmery color that last a long time. It did not dry my lips out. I think this is pretty good product.,5
9808,Great sleeping cap. I didn't experience the bleeding problem some others had. It stays on all night and holds all my hair.,5
9809,"I wish the scent would last. It is great initially, but fades out entirely within a couple of hours.",4
9810,each bar is good for maybe two washes and it crumbles apart.,2
9811,The earrings stem was bent to the point of unwearable. When I bent it straight the earring broke. 0 stars if I could.,1
9812,i hate the mess of flossing this saves me the headache get one and you will know what im talking about.,4
9813,The gems are cute but the segments on the end are impossible to open. So I haven't used them yet.,3
9814,Make up is really good but color is lighter then expected im usually medium in most shades this is much lighter .,4
9815,"The picture shows several soap bags which appear well constructed.  But, this is quite deceiving.  I sent the one bag received back.",1
9816,Didnt work out of the box! My hubby had to take it apart and rewire it!,1
9817,It's not that bad but with a terrible lock.,2
9818,"Stylish, well made razor stand. The chrome finish makes for easy cleaning.",4
9819,"This cream turns my face red, so I'll have to look for something else. Bummer.",1
9820,"They are okay, for the price. I have no complaints. Other reviews are pretty much in line with my observations.",4
9821,Too pasty. Guess you cant expect much for $3.,2
9822,"Although this product gave my hair more body and made it appear thicker, it tended to be very drying and caused some dermatitis around my eyes.",3
9823,"Very good floss and works perfectly, It is smooth and goes through the teeth easily. This mint smell very good.",5
9824,I see no results...even made my skin weird...like wrinkled.,2
9825,Very nice quality. Base is heavy enough that it does not tip over when just the brush or razor is hanging on it,5
9826,Have had zero issues with.  The wand is a little large but is manageable,4
9827,Couldn't use because too small.  For very tiny head.,1
9828,JUNK JUNK JUNK!!! Not worth any money.... would have been better off with hello kitty jewelry.,1
9829,"I thought it was organic, but it is not. Shipped in a BPA free bottle. Very cool!!!",3
9830,This is a standby for me and has been for twenty years. Love it for so many body parts.,5
9831,Yes. My teeth were sensitive to the peroxide. Using Sensodyne toothpaste helped. Going to buy another package-hoping for a little more whitening.,4
9832,Wonderful.  Doubt if I'd have my teeth without a water pick.,5
9833,Pretty good but i can see it off and not real,3
9834,"Operates great, highly recommended. I really like the color changing and the auto-shut off. I would buy this again. My wife loves it.",4
9835,"Wasn't what I thought it would be, metal is cheap looking",3
9836,Not effective. This infact shield to Lice and aggravated  itching,1
9837,"This is the first time, I need a month to judge.",4
9838,This stuff has been the worst. It dries and cracks before even normal wear lipstick does. Discard.,1
9839,not too heavy and has a very nice scent and the price is very reasonable . I would purchase again.,4
9840,Fun seeing my wife's giant boobs wiggle with these on!,5
9841,Not thick as regular mascara.  Have to keep applying!,3
9842,I love the feel of my skin after using the Avon Skin So Soft Fusions Dual Softening Body Wash.  My skin was amazingly smooth!!,5
9843,pretty good scissors!  it would be better if they had a sharpener to accompany.  pretty good purchase for the price!,4
9844,Very thick and noticeable.  Hard to use with other makeup,2
9845,"Rings are extremely too small, better to just go to a store that sells real ones like hot topic or Spencer's.",2
9846,Super messy. Hard to use the wraps. The clay was real soupy the directions could be better. Waste of time n money.,1
9847,Good but I don't notice a big difference with the matte and when you use to little it leaves little white things,4
9848,"Great blades.  Stay sharp for at least a week, sometimes more.",4
9849,Does a great job of volumizing and is gentle on my hair.,5
9850,Very hot. If you are not skillful may hurt your hair.,4
9851,These were exactly what I wanted and cannot buy them in retail stores anymore.,4
9852,It works as stated and expected. Got what I paid for.,4
9853,Works really nice in the winter. May be a little heavy in the summer but I'll still stick with it.,5
9854,I am very dissapointed in this. It smells so good at first but the smell goes completely away after 5 mionutes.,1
9855,This was bought for our son as a gift.  He has only used it a few times but he likes it now.,5
9856,Hard to use; takes time to fit to teeth.,3
9857,Another great product by Derma E. This is a good nighttime cream that will moisturize your face.,5
9858,Electric razors don't get a closer shave than standards ones so I got this.  This did not do the trick just smells bad.,1
9859,Not enough hair. The fabric cloth was showing through the hair in some spots.,3
9860,Recommended by our dentist and they have a nice grip and just right head.,4
9861,This product did not do anything. No peeling at all which is what I was expecting.,1
9862,The quality of this product is terribly made was not happy at all,1
9863,"It's a nice looking bracelet but it is way too fragile. The first day of wearing it broke. Wasted my money, lasted no time",1
9864,Because it's 3D it pokes out a little bit but it's a beautiful piece of jewelry.,4
9865,"Legs arrived bent so item was wobbly. Once straightened out, it was fine.",3
9866,I bought this for my diabetic father after he had some problems with his feet. He's 6 foot 4 and it works great for him!!,5
9867,"Nothing fancy.. just does what its supposed to do.

I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who doesnt want to shell out much for a trimmer.",4
9868,The Didn't Say What Size They Were So The Bar Was To Small For My Lip,2
9869,Haven't found a waterpik yet that lasted more than a year. Too bad they don't make a product that lasts.,3
9870,I make my own saops and love your castor oil! My skin says thank you !  Gail,5
9871,A bit harsher feeling than some mesh sponges Ive used but not uncomfortably so. Does a decent job exfoliating dry skin. Ill use it often.,3
9872,this bubble bath makes an lot of bubbles and the bubbles last a long time but i wish the smell was a little stronger.,4
9873,"They don't look like fake diamond gems.
Most are deformed.",1
9874,"I hope to use soon, to see if this will work with what I had intended to use it for.",4
9875,fell apart immediately.  Sad as it is cute and one gets what one pays for.  Maybe attached it on an immobile item...??,2
9876,Thick and great for night time. I like the smell and it seems to be very moisturizing.,4
9877,way too small of a bottle for the price!!!,1
9878,Doesn't hold a charge after 1 month.  Doesn't work well plugged in.  Already been replaced.,1
9879,"Falls right off.. the 1 inch is fine this is no good
 I doubled this up because the 1 inch was out of stock..waste of money.",1
9880,Don't expect it to function out of the box. Good price for the contents though.,3
9881,"great for e-juice recipes,,,, on my second bottle now. will buy again",5
9882,"Considering I paid $35 for the complete shaver, paying over $20 for just the foil and cutter seems a bit steep.",3
9883,"Cheap junk, by the end of a shave it's already dragging. Don't buy these unless you have peach fuzz for a beard boys.",1
9884,Material wall thickness was thin and was broke in the threaded area when  I got back from my first trip.,1
9885,"This stuff is okay. If you want something that really works, I would use the Aztec Indian Healing Clay. That stuff is amazing!",3
9886,This product made me under eye worse. Puffy and red,1
9887,Good deal for the price.  Does not compare to the more expensive brands however.,3
9888,Leaves my skin soft and well nourished. Will buy again.,4
9889,Very good product for fine/thin hair.  Does help with texture and thickness.,4
9890,I bought this to use on my stomach for itching during my pregnancy. It works great! It did however arrive with a cracked lid :(,4
9891,I bought this as a gift so I can't tell you how well it works.  The person I gave it to seemed very pleased with it.,4
9892,"Features are a little cheap looking, but it works fine",3
9893,Love it .My face feels like silk. Works on hands too,4
9894,gave me a headache. I bought a different brand.,1
9895,"first time I wore it and it ripped the owls out of nowhere, but the rest look very nice after all",3
9896,This will work for anyone.  It has setting for the most gentle of mouths and one hard enough to clean the paint off of the wall.  LOL,4
9897,The top ball wouldn't even screw on. This was a waste of money n I would not recommend it to anyone,1
9898,"This is a great compact water pik.  Has many heads , functions well. serves its purpose.  Happy with this purchase.",4
9899,They all came in dark blue. I was hoping I would get the different colours as pictured.,3
9900,"Great birthday present. Only thing I love better than reading. Lets
everyone know my greatest passion. Sorry, wife is the first.",5
9901,I like it a lot but the tail is cheap looking.  The chain is also very nice and long.,4
9902,I purchased this product when I was in California and liked it.  That's why I purchased it again.,4
9903,The most unsanitized and unwarranted as description is false and nothing like the used up item shipped without explanation seller emails back in vulgar mannerism and tone!,1
9904,It`s oxy tubing doesn`t leak what else can i say other than a bit pricey for what you get.,4
9905,The stuff crumbles and falls out within a very short time.  You might have better luck using softened paraffin.  What a colossal waste of money.,1
9906,"Very weak and flimsy. If you're eating anything sticky, these don't get the job done.",2
9907,Pretty worthless in my opinion.  I'll just use my blender for Bullet-Proof Coffee.,2
9908,"It gets 3 stars for the case which I'd pay a dollar for anyways, but there are NOT 3000 in there",3
9909,"So far so good, I use it on my skin as a skin mask... it leaves my skin feeling clean and doesn't dry it.",4
9910,I wished it came with an instruction on how to use it. otherwise its pretty ok,4
9911,"So excited to receive it but unfortunately it's a FAKE!
Sending it back!!!!",1
9912,"The listing reads 6 oz, pack of two. But I only received one.",1
9913,This worked well on my face after a bad allergic reaction.,5
9914,"However, I love them. The case, colors, everything were good,except if there are more size would be much better to use.",5
9915,It irritates the inside of your nose and it falls out.  I do not recommend this product.,1
9916,It broke after a year and it turns out the limited 2-year warranty is pretty useless. Maybe that's just what you get for $20.,2
9917,My favorite scent for personal care but out is not sold in retail stores anymore. Would order in bulk but cannot justify the marked up price.,4
9918,"Good color, not too heavy, and not too curly. Just right for my current cosplay project. Definitely a good purchase.",5
9919,"Have only used a few times, but I get a decent conditioned feel and HOPE its good for my ""silver"" hair.",4
9920,Use it everyday. Doesn't break like regular floss.,5
9921,"It's not that great! Don't send the money on this, it's not worth it",2
9922,"Not as pictured! Only one pair, not 3 as pictured",2
9923,Not helping fade dark spot but it's okay so far.,3
9924,Love the smell and its soothing as a face toner. I even put it on my baby.  Great! I wish the rose smell last longer,4
9925,Do not buy!! Not silk! And strings are short as hell!,1
9926,"Lovely color and similar to the MAC equivalent. Quite nice, but smells a bit waxy.",4
9927,This did not work well for me. Would recommend buying a Norelco or something nicer.,2
9928,"Already own a colored one, was expecting the sage green color like in the photo. :(",1
9929,II had a Waterpic flosser in the past that was better than this one but this is OK and meets my needs,4
9930,Great product. It's soft and comfortable and easy to inflate. It's much more comfortable than all those plastic bath pillows.,5
9931,Container are not as filled at all as it appears in the picture,3
9932,"Puts out a decent stream, doesn't take citrus oils and the water warms up. Overall I like it but had better.",3
9933,Everyone said it would make me sweat been using it for a week and it has not done that :(,1
9934,It is very good product and has helped me getting rid off tooth sensitivity,4
9935,my wife says I look better when using it. There is not much out there for men. this one works for me.,4
9936,In the description it says it comes with other size blades but it only comes with the attachment combs. Very disappointed,3
9937,"only enough nails for one set, ran out of monomzier very quickly.",3
9938,"Kids love it, helps them brush longer and more thoroughly.  I would recommend to any parent that wants their kids to have healthy teeth.",5
9939,This serves it's purpose but the small legs weren't even. The product wobbles when using it.  It is Kind of annoying.,4
9940,It was first time I tried. Not work. Not working at all.,1
9941,All I can say is they work as advertised. They works as replacement heads for this particular shaver. Cheap and easy order.,4
9942,There are better ones out there.  I'm still looking for ones that are the balanced cost vs price.  These are one shave and dulled.,3
9943,Really makes my hair silky. It's light and does not weigh my hair down or give a greasy appearance. I love it.,5
9944,"The product was a good buy as it was a lot more expensive at stores around here...
Works well keeping my teeth cleannner..",4
9945,This stuff smells disgusting. Does not lather. Don't waste your time or money. .,1
9946,"i like having the option of so many brushes, but they leave little hairs behind when i used them, so that was a bummer.",3
9947,Item is exactly as it states however the actual packaging was instensely cracked when delivered.,3
9948,Went to open it on Halloween for the first time and the liquid latex was already solid.,1
9949,As described-Good packaging-Fast Shipping-I am very happy with items & Seller-Would deal with again!!! A++++,5
9950,"I was concerned with the satin material, that it would slide off; however, it is great and stays in place",5
9951,The soap is great but the fragrance is mild. Sill an excellent product especially for sensitive skin. I prefer the bars to the liquid any day.,4
9952,WEAK!  VERY DISSAPOINTED.  WISH I HAD M MONEY BACK,1
9953,I love Andalou products. They work and they small fantastic.  Reasonably priced. You cannot go wrong .,5
9954,Not sharp enough for a moderately thick beard.  Handle is slippery when wet.  Delivers a very poor shaving experience and will not recommend or buy again.,1
9955,The wax is a straight-up mess. I am very dissappointed with this purchase. Unfortunately this was a waste of money.,2
9956,This is also another great product that i will surely recommend. I observe a lot changes when taking this product. It works,3
9957,"It gets everything done without any pain or discomfort. That said, it broke down completely (stopped working) in 3 years of moderate use.",3
9958,Smells kinda funny.  Not like other rosewater I've used.  Sets my makeup well though.,4
9959,"Works, the finish is a little different from the top to bottom and the bottom has a bubble in the finish.",3
9960,Has a wierd smell and didn't work as well as I had hoped it would.,3
9961,"Holy thick strap.... jeez.  I love Rasta colors and haven't had an issue with the button yet, but the strap is so thick...",4
9962,My tangles are less when I use this together with hair dryer. Satisfied with my purchase.,4
9963,My wife and I both use this unit. It is small enough that it is out-of-the-way yet does everything needed.,5
9964,Easy to use. No itchy scalp afterward.  Smells good.  Much darker color than expected!,3
9965,I really like this line.  Will move to full size once I am through the samples.,5
9966,"The size is too small for the price, needs to be larger!",1
9967,Stones arrived in their own compartment and are a good size which makes using it for nail art easy and simple.,4
9968,i'ved used this for over a year now and absolutely nothing. it certainly has not decreased the amount of hair loss as it's been getting worse.,1
9969,"Fabulous! Goes on smooth and not greasy at all, absorbs wonderful.",5
9970,"The razors are not sharp enough for my liking.  Personally, it was a poor shave.",1
9971,They test on animals meaning this product is officially ruined for me,1
9972,This product healed my cracked skin over this terrible dry winter.  I highly recommend it.  It works wonders without a greasy film,4
9973,Rated 1 by EWG. Smells great. Does sting if gets in eyes though.,5
9974,I used to use wilkinson before. These are much sharper. My favorite!,4
9975,My daughter didn't like this product.  Only used it once.  Doesn't leave your hair feeling smooth.,2
9976,It was well built and just as advertised. I returned it as it was larger than I imagined. Excellent service returning and refunding also.,4
9977,"Feels a little lightweight and not the best quality. Oral-B is usually good, but I wouldn't purchase this particular product again.",3
9978,Really great shampoo. It smells good and leaves hair healthy. Amazing to feel that I've finally found a suitable product,5
9979,Great water flosser! But LOUD! and makes a mess!!!!,3
9980,"Bought this for my wife, she said it did not look like any concealer had been used at all. Definitely not worth the cost.",2
9981,Total waste of money. It looks nothing like the photos.,1
9982,"Works well, looks good, rubber / foam base is a good idea.",4
9983,It's cute the only thing they do slide a bit maybe I'm not putting them on right but they are adorable,3
9984,"This soap is amazing, refreshing and very good for the skin.",4
9985,"its not much bigger than 5cent match box, but for it's intended purpose it's good
to lather and doesn't have much scent.",3
9986,"I am new to a safety razor and am still testing blades; however, this is one of my favorites.  It is sharp and forgiving.",5
9987,Works but is extremely loud. We can't use it if anyone in the house is sleeping.,4
9988,Love this I just let my hair dry natural to just damp then style with this,5
9989,"Its a wooden bowl, buy it! It fits the standard glycerin soap puck I bought on Amazon as well. Done and done.",4
9990,I ordered 2 items but I don't see 8 cool dpesign stickers + 2 bonus sticker sheets for a fun and customized brush in both of them,1
9991,The eye whip is very soothing.  I like it's creamy texture. It really does help to lighten up the eyes.,4
9992,"good product, best choice available, we have used this for several years and always pleased",5
9993,they r soooo small but good to review for cheap to give my honest review,3
9994,"Let me tell you, Don't bother.  I can not even get the stuff out the tubes.  No wonder it was so cheap.",1
9995,Cheap plastic comb! You can finds better ones at Walmart. Not possible to return as well.,1
9996,"I have used this product before and I think it's great, not over powering, I highly recommend this
to the guys...............",4

10050,Great variety but brushes feel too rough for skin. Blush and powder brushes especially .  Pouch and selection are great. Shipped fast  also,2

10068,Good product. One of the lenses came loose after a month but I can push it back in.,3

10135,I got it for my 8 yr old kid and he enjoys flossing everyday. It's real good for kids with the berry flavor.,4
10136,It got the job done. Smells a little funny fresh out of the bottle but once on it does the job.,4
10137,"I wish it was waterproof, but it does the job!",4
10138,So far i haven't used any blade better than Astra only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I haven't tried every other brand yet,4
10139,"The product broke immediately before I could even try it.

Don't buy this.",1
10140,The product itself looks good but it didn't get a carrying case. I'm pretty bummed about that.,2

10142,The gloss is just perfect on my lips! Loved the smell and didn't feel it sticky at all. The taste was good too ;),4

stings on burns, cuts.",4
10166,"I think it is good, but it is a little expensive for me. ... it's the patch of word lock",4
10167,Only use double-edged razor.  Hard to find blades.  Reasonably priced and probably won't need any more for a very long time.,5

10173,The manufacturer has changed this floss from its original thickness to something much thinner. I will be discontinuing my use.,1

10186,Is it working??  I think I got the smallest size available and it is a lifetime quantity for me.. Very Fragrant.,4

10189,"My boy very like it,he is loving this toothbrush.",5
10190,"I use this cape when I cut my husband's hair. It works well, although it could be longer in the back.",4

10192,"It's reliable, last for weeks without needing a charge. Sometimes it takes an effort to get a smooth shave though.",3
10193,Gel Bunion Spreader help very much. They were very easy to clean & no problems in wearing them in my shoes.,4

10221,Works great! Gave it 4 stars because it does not have a tool for each family member. It has tools for different types of jobs.,4
10222,Really helpful when I'm in the shop. No need to turn around and waste seconds that I need to finish up a cut.,4

10233,"Works as advertised. Strongly recommend it. Wish it came with two standard tips. A little noisy, but a good product.",4

10249,These fit nicely in my triangle swim suit and are high quality well made. I'm sure I will have them a long time.,5
10250,"Thats the smell I wanted! I dig this product, wish it would last longer, its an aftershave not a cologne and its classic!",5
10251,Did not come with the colored sleeves and the brush head is larger then our adult sonicare brushes ...,2
10252,I love how they spread the awareness of autism!! I have  a problem with the stickers they are very small and they easily break.,3
10253,In my opinion Norelco razors are the best of the electrics,5
10254,"Beautiful color, but it is not only flavored with vanilla, but perfumed. Tastes horrible and burned my lips.",1
10255,too dry for my lip. not easy to apply. I had to put lip balm before I use it,3
10256,Smells nice. I would have liked something with more 'sting' but this is okay.,4
10257,As expected I use it as a mixer to make my foundation more full coverage,4
10258,"made my old razor liike new...
getting a close shave again, just like the old days
didn't know if they were available any longer",5
10259,My favorite scent for personal care but out is not sold in retail stores anymore. Would order in bulk but cannot justify the marked up price.,4
10260,my husband has been using this for about 6 weeks so far no change as him or I can tell..,3
10261,Works well for detangling but not a fan of the smell,4
10262,Quite cheap. And very little variety but for the price it's expected,3
10263,"Ahhhhh mazing Lip Balm. I have them all over my house and at my desk at work, just in case.  LOVE EOS.",5
10264,This is a rip off at 38.99 Suggested retail is 8.99 what are you folks doing,1
10265,"Wife says it works great on her soar swollen feet. . She is happy with it. .
Strong smell though. .",5
10266,The button gets stuck which is annoying.  Otherwise the product works as intended.,3
10267,"I like this product ,,, it works fine ,,, easy to carry ,,, I recommend this product for people who travel a lot",4
10268,"keeps my gums and teeth clean, a little noisy, but it works fine.  apparently I need to type more words to submit",4

10286,Great price for the razor's that are harder to find at the local shops.,4
10287,"This product has a pleasant smell and works fine but I probably won't repurchase due to the price. Regular moisturizer does fine, or coconut oil.",4

10289,I like this unit. Easy to use but would like to have a longer cord.,4
10290,"Great item, easy to use and very clear on your phone. Wish I had purchased these before my $50 one from the mall kiosk.",5

10296,"These are very comfortable, but kind of a pain to put on.",4

10298,"Gives a good close shave. I have been using these for several years, never had any issues. x x x",4
10299,I resently went on a cruise and I recived many  complements on this belly ring!,3
10300,"Razor works like new. Close shave and easy to install. My 90 year old father did it himself, no problem.",4
10301,"i am a classic man, i've prefered to use the blade shave and philps is an alternative for me, execellent.",4
10302,"Has a slightly off smell, though it's been stored properly. Seems to do the job though.",4
10303,Very good product.  Have been using Aqua Velva Musk After Shave for years.,5
10304,"it's OKAY, BUT I AM CHANGING TO HEMP PRODUCTS FOR MORE HEALING!",3
10305,Quality is very good. Arrived quickly. They are smaller than I really wanted.,4
10306,Just didn't really care for color but that's my preference,1
10307,The information says a booklet would come with it but it didn't.,3
10308,Awesome product. The blades come in 10 blade boxes I think and stay sharp for a long time.,5
10309,So far it helps reduce the cysts or brings them to a head quicker. I like it.,3
10310,"It works well; however, not fond of the cost.",3
10311,I love the scent and the natural ingredients.  Minus one star because it can be a bit harsh on my skin at times.,4
10312,Four out of four bottles received with under-cap seals broken. Product unusable for that reason.,2
10313,Definitely a good buy!  Chain needs to be longer and a second dog tag to be more like Wolverine.,4
10314,Have used this product for over a year and it works great to hide my roots!,4
10315,Was not the item pictured on this page. Fits but does not shave as well as the correct model. Avoid!,1
10316,"Worth the price, vibrant colors and good size gems. Box is not to big or to small for easy storage.",5
10317,too large and heavy.  they fall forward.  posts are too long,2
10318,I have an Airbnb.  This is perfect for guests.  The price is right and I can provide shampoo with little waist.  I appreciate this product,5
10319,"This stuff really works.  It allows me to get a close, smooth shave with no burning or irritation.",4
10320,"Smaller than expected, I thought it was a regular size comb.",3
10321,Awesome product! We've been making our own household cleaners and tea tree oil is great for disinfecting. Fast shipping!,5
10322,AWESOME PRODUCT SUPER FAST SERVICE OMG I think I may have had the money in the account still when we received the product,5
10323,"It is not giving a close shave, but hurting the skin. It is worse than electric shavers, even disposable razors.",1
10324,"Several misshaped and bent, package opened in box, spilled all over and through edges of box. Otherwise, work as expected.",3
10325,One of the best seasons of the best cartoon I've ever seen.,5
10326,This is more peach color than pink. I was hoping for pink.,3
10327,"Much harder to use than I thought, but it looks so good when you get it right.",4
10328,perfect for my eczma they heat my hand very well just remember to put your spa cotton mitten,5
10329,Works great I've bought two. I stepped on the first one.,5
10330,This is not a makeup foundation first of all. Ageless ultra max is a supplement.,3
10331,Works well for stamping. Some of the lighter colors do not work as well as the darker but overall a good product for this use.,4
10332,Works well but wish I could find one with a smaller barrel,4
10333,"Very similar to the Diva Cup, but much cheaper.  Worth every penny. The stem is filled in, not hallow like the Diva cup.",5
10334,This product is excellent.  I use it every day.  It makes your hair feel and look thicker without any heavy residue.,5
10335,The colors are lovely and it is easy to use.,4
10336,Pretty cheap. Doesn't trim my beard very consistently and now the battery is no longer holding a charge. I wouldn't recommend it.,1
10337,Excellent soap with a great smell.  Tha ladies get close to me more often when I use this soap.,5
10338,This is better than anything else I've used to conceal roots.  Love it!,5
10339,To tiny for my nose can't even see it.  Way to small,1
10340,Smells good - love this product.  Good for your natural hair!,5
10341,"Used only one time & so far, it's made giving myself a pedicure a whole lot easier than ever before.",4
10342,Slightly thicker than normal blades makes them sturdier and last longer.,5
10343,Love this product. Cleans hair quickly and leaves hair soft.,5
10344,"Would not recommend. I used it as a trimmer a few times and every time I did, I got ingrown hairs.",1
10345,I received it broken and couldn't put it back together. It started turning colors after the second day I had it. I'm very disappointed,1
10346,"I recieved the brushes quickly but they smelled really bad,they were poorly put together. The brushes started to come apart as I used them",2
10347,"They work alright,  little hard to get a good shave the first time, but once used once, they worked fine .",4
10348,"This is my favorite type of make up, and my favorite color pallet!",5
10349,bought product before...it works great no more razor burn,5
10350,I bought these refills with the Braun razor for my husband and he loves the razor!,5
10351,"I bought 180 at CVS, and it was great; yet this one is a huge disappointment. The texture was terrible.",1
10352,"Amazing product, very simple to use, and a million times better than the hassle of flossing. I especially love all the attachments",5
10353,looks nicer in picture.  This was cheap and looks cheap,2
10354,Doesn't get very hot...maybe my hair is just to thick.  Doesn't seem to do much for me.,3
10355,This broke as soon as I got it. It was huge and not resize able.,1
10356,Easy to use and great color....will continue to use.,4
10357,COST OF THIS IS CONTINUNING TO RISE HAS MORE THAN DOUBLED IN LAST YEAR OR SO. A GOOD ITEM FOR ME JUST HARD TO BUY.,3
10358,Started coming undone after one week.  The dove brand are much better quality.,2
10359,I have been using this product for 6 months now and see no difference.,2
10360,"Took this for a week, had watery, painful poop from the very first dose. Quit taking it and the next day I pooed solid again.",2
10361,No noticeable effects.  I recommend going with a traditional cologne of your personal preference.,2
10362,Cant live without item! My naturally curly hair loves this oil and I loves the price an quality.,5
10363,"Very cumbersome, impractical and painful to use. Does not work.
Keep your  money or buy Rogaine or some other product.",1
10364,This necklaces and earings set is just simply beautiful i love it!!!!!,5
10365,"They work that's all I can say, because the colors are basically all the same. They're not super pigmented as well.",4
10366,"Would have loved to try it, but I received and eyeliner instead. The eyeliner is ok, I would have preferred what I had originally purchased.",3
10367,"This just did not work for me.  Maybe it would work for people with short hair, or men who do not need conditioner.",1
10368,"This product softens skin. It clears up wrinkles and gives the skin a glowing texture.
It makes your skin look younger.",5
10369,Cute crown not great quality but will work very nice with my princess Halloween costume!,3
10370,Not a great product but an average product. A razor will work just as good.,3
10371,I was hoping it would work for my hair but it didn't as it left too much residue.,3
10372,It was not clear what I was ordering.....I expected something else,1
10373,I love the colors they give you. They are the perfect size and they give you so many of them! Love doing nail art with them.,5
10374,I got the black ones and they came with gray scratches all over them and material was very cheap,1
10375,I liked this very much and it washes out easy!,4
10376,"I enjoy using the product, but don't squeeze the container at all....mine split on the bottom and made a huge mess.",4
10377,I only just started using this product and it definitely cleans well.,5
10378,Very moisturizing but too greasy for the face in tropical climates.,4
10379,Not sure why this wasn't recommended earlier in my life but I am glad to have it now. This machine works wonders.,5
10380,Love this product. Have used it off and on for years.,5
10381,Best value I've found for this product.  Stores have only 2x or 3x packs.,4
10382,It does not have or leave the scent of the home fragrance. Disappointed.,3
10383,I made my own magnesium oil with this and now I have more than enough flakes to make other magnesium based products with as well.,4
10384,The electric razor blades were delivered in record time and the product was in excellent condition-as advertised.,4
10385,This Item needs replacing ever-so-often because it does wear out.,5
10386,Great ways to clean your teeth and your gum. It really helps me clean the area between my teeth and prevent gum diseases.,4
10387,my friend thinks it is hard to use and the hand held pumps work better.,1
10388,The shades are awesome but very sticky..if applied with a moisturizer it stains,2
10389,Not really a matte like colour pop. Still smears but it's a great color !,4
10390,"They say random color and I received pink and the band is cheap, breaks and you ha Ebro loop it yourself no thanks",1
10391,Superior customer service from Rock Ridge Sales!!  Key Enablers are excellent tools for house and work keys.,5
10392,I wore them attached to my lanyard. After less than a week the pen didn't stay in the cap. The fit isn't tight enough.,1
10393,"Not a total ""clean"" shave but pretty darn close. I would buy again.",4
10394,decent soap but i felt like its odor was a bit strong,3
10395,Visco-Gel toe buddy was not effective as the right foot triple toe straightener.,3
10396,"Using this to shed water weight with a neoprene waist belt...working so far for this purpose, helps me to sweat.",4
10397,I like the fact that I seem to walk better while taking this product.,4
10398,"Sharp, get about 4 cuts before it starts to nick you up.  Solid razors.",4
10399,"Just what the doctor ordered, literally. String flossers just didn't do it for me. The Waterpik  just works much better.",4
10400,"These pins stay in the hair well and are easy to use, but I still much prefer the old bobby pins.",3
10401,"After using them, I can feel that I have less hair falling off. They seem to make your hair softer also.",5
10402,Great brush.  But it's pink.  They didn't say exactly what color it was going to be.,4
10403,Very noisy so I returned it and bought a different brand. The shaver works great I just didn't like the loud sound that it had.,2
10404,"Has zinc oxide in it, which is used on all kind of skin conditions.  This is a helpful powder.",4
10405,"DOESNT COMPARE TO THE BRAUN 9595, NO MATTER WHAT CONSUMER REPORT SAYS; I HAVE BOTH.",3
10406,These go for a lot more in the Store. No Tax and Free Shipping always helps,5
10407,Doesn't do a good job. Not worth purchasing.,2
10408,Very cute but it loosens up all the time. It even fell out a couple of times.,2
10409,Works great.  Easy to follow directions.  Kit comes with pretty much everything you need.  I would recommend this product.  It pays for itself.,5
10410,Great!. I love this dryer  so powerful  and fast..recommended  friends,5
10411,"Not the greatest, but it does a decent job.  Horrible when wet.  Easy to clean.",3
10412,These are nice brushes for the price but I have had nicer ones. But I paid a lot more for the good ones.,3
10413,Excellent waterpik. Updated design that is very easy to use. Would recommend this to anyone who wishes a super clean mouth!,5
10414,Totally not anything like I have purchased before.  If it wouldn't cost as much to return it as it cost I would definitely do so.,1
10415,These brushes are made of plastic. They are very poor quality. I guess you can't expect more for the price.,2
10416,Purchased this for my oldest. He loves it! Modern scent. Large bottle and a little goes a long way,5
10417,Cheap.  Seams came apart within  a few weeks.  Smelled really bad too but that finally went away.,1
10418,"It works well! A little bulky but the storage of the supply line is a good improvement on previous models.
No regrets!",4
10419,I did not like the smell of this and was fearful to use it on my hair line.  Thinking it would dry out my skin.,1
10420,"Cute toothbrush to encourage brushing.
Stickers come with it and you can customize the toothbrush.",5
10421,"It is nice for the price, The color is much more blue in person. Daughter loves it.",4
10422,I found that the color polish went on streaky.  I also think it is more pink than peach.  Keep in mind this is just my opinion.,3
10423,My favorite fragrance.  Subtle but wonderful scent.  Unfortunately can rarely find here.,5
10424,I like this product and continue to buy it. I recommend it to anyone who wants a natural breath fresher that works internally.,4
10425,Product is too drying on sensitive skin. Doesn't have a nice rose smell. Overpriced considering what you get. Would not order again.,1
10426,I like the product is perfect gift for my sister... My sister loved the product and liked it a lot.. Happy Holidays :),5
10427,it is shimmery and for me i have acne so i feel it makes the acne show more for a high brand i thought it would be nicer,3
10428,its too hard .....you cant move the fingers or nothing,1
10429,It works. I use it every night before going to bed as a preventative treatment.,4
10430,Just doesn't get hot enough for my hair.  But I use it everyday just the same.  I love that the tines don't get hot.,3
10431,I find it clumsy to use and the shave not very close.  A regular razor works better.,3
10432,arrived earlier than expected I am very pleased with my rings,5
10433,"Used as directed and noticed no diference, also bought a new one from a local saloon and same thing..",1
10434,This product does not do anything. I used the whole thing: no difference whatsoever. Spend your money on something else.,1
10435,"After maybe a year these start to wear down. They're soft, but didn't pick up a lot of product",3
10436,"We have used a Waterpic for years. This products is better than the others we have had,",5
10437,It worked well until it stopped working. I had the thing for only 3 months. It's really a shame because I really liked it.,2
10438,Nice product - covers well and leaves the skin with a smooth texture,4
10439,Not for those with very fair skin.  Must be applied with a very light touch - a little goes a long way.,3
10440,they work ok although I felt they are uncomfortable.  I bought them to wear while using the Aurora Light Therapy System.,3
10441,Didn't expect much for $2 but I liked this ! the earrings are cute and comfortable,4
10442,Use it several times a day and keep well shaven all the time.,4
10443,Broke after one use.  Don't waste your money.,1
10444,"I thought I was purchasing the silk wrap in the green package,  but this works just as good and arrived quickly, Thank you!",4
10445,Makes my life easier. Perfect color as it blends with my lips its just slightly darker.,5
10446,This is NOTHING like the previous Helen of Troy curling brush.  It tangles hair terribly and does a terrible job.,1
10447,Product is ok. Wish is were stronger as it will sometimes break. Not as good as the better floss brands.,3
10448,"Very easy to use - and the 1 inch diameter. useful with my short hair-do.
Easily cleaned and electric cord long enough for ease of use.",4
10449,"A little hard to get used to - squirts all over until you get the hang of it, then it's easy.",4
10450,Does make it easier and comfortable to shave with this product,4
10451,Totally sucks. It takes a lot of effort to hold the handle. Not sharp enough to cut hangnails.,1
10452,So far so good. It doesn't irritate my skin.,4
10453,Best eye cream you can buy and it's cheap.,5
10454,Covers roots very well. Can make it possible to go extra two weeks before coloring roots. Makes hair look thicker. Easy to use.,4
10455,It's very easy to use.  I used mostly on my face.  It was a little greasy,4
10456,Came with everything except for the needle. Fantastic. Came on time though haha,2
10457,"love these two together or separately. no strong ""statement"" odor. feel so much more comfy on hot days.",3
10458,has a nice smell but it doesn't last long.when you put it on your skin be careful it does cause a minor skin irritation.,3
10459,"Even good at cleaning other bathroom nooks & crannies - around faucets, drains & handles. Oh - works on teeth too!",4
10460,Does leave you teeth a bit brighter but you will feel a sting!,3
10461,"Nice for a pickup between shampoos.  Rather expensive.  Does not spray well, liquid kind of pops out.",3
10462,"Absolutely fits the bill, keeps my razor and brush stable, secure and avoids mess. What else could I want?",4
10463,"This essential oil smells like tiger balm.
Tried to return it but the company doesn't refund shipment",1
10464,"Great product, great instruction, very professional for the home",5
10465,I loved the texture and the way the paints went on with vibrant color.,5
10466,"I buy them from american amazon.com, the products very good!",4
10467,never saw a bit of difference so did not order again for all the reviews i read i was hopefull,2
10468,"Don't like the color, how it goes on, and how little it lasts.  You get what you pay for.",2
10469,"[[ASIN:B0009MMKSY Eagle Brand Medicated Oil 0.8 Oz.]

Great product I use it just about every day for my pain!",4
10470,The plastic was opened when I recieved it and all the needles were missing.,1
10471,Conditioner was not sealed and had spilled in package ! Can not review if it works or not .,1
10472,This item couldn't keep hair off because of design.  Waste of money.,1
10473,Leaves a little bit of residue in my daughter's hair but does the job well otherwise!,4
10474,"still doesn't seem as good as the original mach 3 razor, but good overall...best with a good shaving cream and some sort of scrub beforehand",3
10475,"Very cute, but the chain turned black after I wore it 3 times.",2
10476,It was great exactly what was said in the ad. Thank you,5
10477,looks great has a good weight to it is working well with my new razor,4
10478,I got a pink one. Not thrilled about that but It does say a random color so I cannot complain.,4
10479,"Look very nice, but left hairs on my face during application. Do not recommend it.",1
10480,"At first it stung a little, but after using for a few days it seemed to have gotten better",3
10481,Smells amazing but I just want the scent to last longer after I put it one.,4
10482,Don't know why but this doesn't last as long as the same brand I purchased at Walmart last year .,3
10483,The tape works great but for $26 I thought I was getting a case of these no justification for such a price and I returned it,1
10484,"Wish we had know about the Thieves Spray at least 10 years ago, love the scent!",5
10485,Excellent reference material for analysts or those interested in the subject. Detailed diagrams and great information.,5
10486,Only option for makeup mirror. Can't find in stores .  Cant beat the price.  The only choice if you want to use the mirror.,5
10487,This product is very poorly made. It riped after only 1 use so I'm very dissatisfied with this product & wouldn't recommend it to anyone.,1
10488,It's good at detangling and it doesn't have an overpowering scent. It works well on my 8 year old's long hair.,4
10489,very small unit. This is not what I got & my curls don't stay in very long,3
10490,"Very dark lipstick, but perfect for fall and looks really cool. I got compliments on it.",4
10491,Good value for quality/vial capacity. The skin is not irritated.,4
10492,Received the wrong item. Ordered the oil free moisturizer and received the soothing moisturizing creme,1
10493,"Tape doesn't stick very well, starts coming loose after a few minutes.",1
10494,Looks great.  Good quality product for the price.  Matches my Merkur razor perfectly.,5
10495,Texture is nice but does not smell like roses. Smells like old medicine...,3
10496,"Works well, just keep it away from water when not in use, the battery area got messed up.",4
10497,I'd lost a lot of weight and needed these. They helped but I wouldn't want to use them in Texas in the summer*L*.,3
10498,"Good. Easy to use, of good quality, and it was sealed.",5
10499,Very cute but I have a normal size head and the minute I went to put it on it snapped in half!! :(,1
10500,"Pretty color, just what I was looking for! :)",4
10501,Purchased for my spa treatments....hope it does works on my clients!,4
10502,I really like that they're flexible and they can give form to my face very well,4
10503,"This piece of jewelry is awful. The cheap paint started peeling off within 2 days, and it irritated my piercing. Don't waste your money.",1
10504,Very a good product a quality exceptional has to recommend has all the easy world of employment and very correct use and a good redu on the skin,4
10505,"Don't work as well as originals. Even after break in, I don't get as close a shave as I got before.",1

10508,works but not as strong a jet as I would like,3
10509,Did not work. I bought strips that really work wonderful,1
10510,I did not see any results from using this product.  I can only imagin that it requires long term use.,3
10511,I received the wrong product so I haven't actually tried this one.  I reordered.,3
10512,So stupid to waste my money on this junk stay away. Its Not even worth for free.. no don't think twice.. just ignore,1
10513,"Love the style edit.  Easy to apply, covers well and color is good.",1
10514,"I wasn't sure this clear thick ointment would work, but it is doing a very good job at retaining moisture and healing",5

10519,"When you fill the container with water, the water runs out the bottom, leaving a mess from the sink to the water flosser.",2
10520,It's not what I expected.  The emory for filing is very small and very slow.,2
10521,"I have had good results with this shaver.

 I would recomed to other people if they would like to buy one.",4

10527,Love the pink goggles for my tanning bed. They are great and come with a stretchy cord so they don't fall off my face!!!,5
10528,"Not fragrant, weird consistency - only positive thing I can say is they lather up",1
10529,i use this every other day so far no complaints besides the battery life.. could be better next time around.,3
10530,Worked well at removing blackheads but the tingling became a burning sensation before the allotted time was up. Be careful if you have sensitive skin.,3
10531,Packaging not great at all. When it arrived it was melted.,1
10532,Love this lipstick. Nice color. Super pigmented and very moisturizing.,4
10533,I've had one of these before and I remember the older one being much louder.  I wish the cord were a little longer.,4

10545,Really love this diffuser for my doTERRA EO.  My only wish is that it would last longer ...,4
10546,This did not work at all.  I could not get it to stay up on the tile or the glass in my shower.  Completely useless!,1
10547,Lots of blades. Don't know until when I will run out of them. But these blades are pretty good.,5
10548,Pretty Good While It Lasted. I got in the pool & it fell apart. I probably could have fixed it. But I didn't bother.,2
10549,No peeling ever occurred. Very annoyed considering how expensive this product is.,1
10550,This works great for kids. It is easy for them to use.  I will see how long one bar lasts.,4
10551,I thought it was suspicious that the seal on the lotion was broken.  If this was a new product I would have expected a closed seal.,3
10552,"A classic. I use it as a body cream after a shower. Fresh, powdery smell. It is a light cream for the face.",4
10553,Hurt like a muther when I pulled it off my face. Lesson learned; buy the remover and primer.,3

10556,Great moisturizing lipstick but it broke off at the base after a short period of use.,2
10557,Does not lather at all.  I think it cleans ok but am still debating that.  I will stick with Dial or Dove.,1
10558,This scuttle is too thick to actually keep anything warm.  It does work well as a simple shaving soap holder.,3
10559,This works wonders if you have any area that is extremely dry.  It is definitely more of a consistency of vaseline than a lotion.,5
10560,They r very thin and bend easily it is a disappointment,2

10571,Bought it for my wife and she's using it regularly with good results.,4
10572,Puts out very little air. If you have thick hair this will not work for you.,1

10580,"I love it, but my order was incomplete, I just received one hair band of 8",5
10581,While they are stuck on they are fine.  'the adhesivegives out in a week or so.,3
10582,They look just like the picture and for the price I would buy again. They are alittle stiff at first but overall pleased.,4

I have used this product forever but it does not last long before replacement is necessary.",3

10588,These blades cut well for around a year or so.  I like this e razor,4
10589,Really does the job. One of the best. Quality of the product is excellent.,4
10590,Received item today and some shades are cracked/broken. Not happy about it.,1
10591,The brushes came right off at the handles the first time I tried to use them. Just proves you get what you pay for cheap and poor quality,1

10593,I love andalou's other products but this one made my skin break out in hives (I have exceptionally sensitive skin.),3

10595,"These are great, they smell and taste nice, but they are lip balms, not glosses as the description says .",3
10596,Luxurious wig. Super pleased. Hairs don't fall out and it lays with nice curls.,5
10597,Product too small around the chest and back. Couldn't wait to get it off.,2
10598,"For the price it works great, and the plastic is super clear, it does sound cheap and plastickie but aesthetic and function work all around.",5
10599,"Basic mirror, serves its purpose, cheap price, cheap plastic. The first orde came broken, return was easy and at no charge.",4
10600,Extremely hard and depending on placement on the frame may cause a very uncomfortable feeling.,1

10602,"great quality, great package, consistent shave. not the sharpest, but among the most well balanced ones.",4
10603,This Pressing Oil works beautifully on my hair and I get lots of compliments.,5

10606,"We purchased higher priced irrigators for many years, but the Water Pik model meets or surpasses those other brands!  Will buy this one again and again!",5
10607,Don't really see a difference. Doesn't ever seem to absorb and rubs off on everything regardless of how long I wait. Smells nice though.,3
10608,Does what it promises. I use this when I wear my support hose.,4

10612,Does not squeeze out of the tube easily & dull color. Would not recommend purchasing,1
10613,The neck is too big for anyone in my family. I have to use a clip instead of the Velcro.,3
10614,"it's great for the price and there are many of them of different colors, the picture does not mislead anyone",4
10615,Skin did not improve. Felt like using scented water.,1

10618,Gets heated up for couple of minutes of trimming. Didn't like the noise too.,1
10619,"This product is very, very small!  Also, I think that it will not work over crowns.",2
10620,This is the ticket if you're using a shaving soap. Keeps the water out in the shower.,4
10621,"I continue to look for mini brushes.  I thought this was it, but it's standard size.",2
10622,"I purchase another brand last time and I ended up ordering that brand again. This one does not stay on properly, doesn't stick well.",2

When I scratch it discolors my nails.",4
10633,"you could get 100 blades for such a cheap price? Very cost efficient, good for the budget. Couldn't ask for better.",5
10634,"Pretty much a vasoline type  petroleum product , Works fine for that purpose.",3

10636,They're not the best product to use but I guess it's okay for beginners.,3
10637,Doesn't last for weeks. It lasts as long as your next shower. And do not try on kids skin.,3

10645,Razor is everything I expected.  I haven't used an electric razor in 30+ years.,4

10647,item is very helpful and very comfortable. I has helped my wife and provide a welcome relief. Have purchased a second set,5
10648,Broke the first day my daughter wore it. Cheaply put together.,1
10649,It is much more cheaply made than my last one. I have to set it on 6 instead of 2 as it is less powerful.,3

10651,Do not come with music. I had one with music.,1

10657,The barrette was very nice to look at but was very flimsy. It came apart the second time I used it. I was very disappointed.,1

10694,It does help dry your polish but more surface dry.,4

10697,You probably need to use them often to make them more fluffy. but i would buy the 22 pc set if i were u,4
10698,I like the Method Body Washes. The peach is a clean fresh scent that I like but seems just a little bit strong.,4

10724,"Got the package, opened it and only one side of the glasses had the protective lens. Other side was just a hole.",1

10757,cannot rate to the max.  still waiting to see the effect. but seems OK for my hair.,3

10766,I have used this cover stick for years.  It does a great job,4
10767,This is great! Absorbs. Not greasy. Smells great.,5
10768,"It does improve the color tone of my complexion, but it does not hide imperfections or blemishes.",4
10769,It would be nice if they increased by half sizes. High quality! !!,4
10770,"Not sure if they are sterling silver, but it was fun to share these beauties with my girlfriends!",3
10771,"There was no cap or tape on this, and about one fifth of the product had leaked out into the box when I received it",2
10772,"Had the shaver 12 months, and it just stopped working.  Never got it wet and cleaned if after each use.  Barely used--So upset.",1
10773,My head didn't itch or burn while using it or after.  I had to leave on longer to cover my gray,4
10774,The battery operation is the best part. Lasts a long time and powerful cut. The re-charge razors never held-up after repeated charges.,5
10775,"product works as directed, but I bought the 2 pack and they only sent me one pack.",1
10776,I have always used a rotary razor and still prefer it over this but I have used this razor several times and it preforms as it should.,4
10777,"These clips are really thin, bendy and feels cheap. They snap too easily under pressure so I wouldn't recommend it for bigger busts.",3
10778,I never realized how good a water pic works until I bought one. It's a great product and really helps with removing foodstuff from your teeth.,5
10779,Not sharp at all. Duller than the entry level Derby blade.  Took multiple passes to shave and caused lots of razor burn.,2
10780,"Great item-heats up fast and has 2 settings.

Perfect for fast touch ups!",4
10781,Gets the job done a little slow and I use it without the plastic top so I can get a closer shave but thats just me,4
10782,"I liked the moisturizing healing effect, but a little oily and slow dissolving. Would prefer it to be easier dissolving.",4
10783,"Color goes on ""thin.""  Too much dabbing on the compact and it  ""powders off"" which is wasteful.",2
10784,Product works quite well. Shaves the skin surface smoothly. It is easy to clean and holds a charge well.,4
10785,Nice cream though sometimes it does not get easily absorbed into skin.,4
10786,"Work ok as a shield, but the bridge is too small for my face.",3
10787,It does work but because it is a Petrolatum it is greasy on your hands when you first apply. I usually put it on at night.,4
10788,"Jena keep falling off with no effort
Not worth the purchase",1
10789,"I yam what I yam! And I yam a tube. I have only 2 holes but they have fittings, Please adapt me.",4
10790,"comfortable nigh cap, does not come off while you are sleeping",4
10791,This set made beautiful headbands and everyone at the baby shower loved doing this.,5
10792,Should be advertised as a toddler brush. Its small and cheap looking for what i paid,1
10793,These are exactly as I expected but they took a very long time to come from China,4
10794,lots of different colors and not mixed up or 1/4 full. way to go! i wish all jewels came like this,5
10795,I am pleased with the product.  I use it as a facial cleanser.  It has a nice fragrance and cleans my face well.,4
10796,looks great but kinda tight. hurts my head with prolonged wear.,4
10797,Easy to use in the shower. Will know more how well it works at my dentist Appoinment ;-),4
10798,Love it. Makes my hair just lovely and curly.,5
10799,Love it but need a primer so the gel dosent clump up after awhile from blinking,4
10800,"Beautifully made wig, but would only fit a child.  Should indicate it's a child's size wig in the description.",3
10801,its difficult to position the curved metal part over my ponytail,2
10802,This is such a cute accent to fingernails. Adds fun to plain nails. Order came on time & of high quality.,5
10803,Really cleared up my excema.  Messy but worth it.,4
10804,Good for an olive type compexion. Too dark  for very fsir skin. Gave them to someone withthat,3
10805,I was looking for an opaque mascara for vibrantly colored lashes. This mascara is very transparent and does not change the color of your lashes very much.,3
10806,The powder works really well on thighs as designed by that breast cream did absolutely NOTHING! in fact i continued to sweat after multiple appilications,3
10807,"Very nice but just a little too small.  Bought a bigger one that is perfect.  Great for smaller purses, however.",3
10808,Great floss - and most fragile.  Consistently breaks e v e r y  t i m e.,2
10809,I now have a years supply (for my superior shaver).,4
10810,Pretty good. This is the best shaver that I have used. I will buy another one for my dad. I strongly recommend this.,5
10811,It was exactly how i expected but the part behind my ears hurts after wearing them for a while,4
10812,Works ok. A little disappointed. I like the lemon chamomile for my hair the best!,3
10813,"I enjoy the prospects of it and the use of it is stimulating the say the very least, thank you",4
10814,Not a fan. Doesn't smell pleasant at all.,2
10815,Lovely product but sadly useless here in Ireland as it does not have dual voltage.,1
10816,Nice peachy/pink color... My hairdresser had used this on me and I loved the natural look of the color,4
10817,Works great.  Noticeable whitening after only a few days.  Simple to use. I would recommend this product,4
10818,"Buy it, what do you have to lose...it works. I don't use them everyday but when the weather gets warmer I sure will!",4
10819,My skin was more oily using this stuff during the day than other primers.,1
10820,The smell is not that manly. It works ok.,4
10821,Very nice product! I have purchased it a number of times.,4
10822,They were what I expected except that I got alot of orange and red ones and not much of other colors.,3
10823,"I love the scent; I bought it  for use as a facial toner, but it's strong enough to use as a perfume splash.",4
10824,It was a good mask worked out great for the masquerade I attended.,4
10825,works ok same as the stuff at the drug store.,4
10826,Smells good and works okay. If you have really sensitive skin I would go with something else like First Aid Beauty Smooth Shave Cream.,3
10827,"Certainly no sweating in the feet after use, but make sure to wash feet every day and put on clean socks on a daily basis.",4
10828,good color but very drying and the chemical odor will knock you over,2
10829,Thought it would hold my Fusion razor but it doesn't. My fault for not reading description in full.,2
10830,I absolutely hated it. The glue does not stick well or last long at all. It's not waterproofNeve,1
10831,Works on any skin tone.  So glad I invested! Use it on a daily basis. Won't have to buy anything else for a while!,5
10832,did not get the variety of colors shown in the picture,2
10833,"Too narrow, it won't hold a pony tail and I have very little hair but quality it good.",3
10834,Fantastic Quality and shipping was lightning fast!  Very happy with this product!,5
10835,"I love this toner, but like others have mentioned, the product listing states that it's for 2 bottles... I only received 1 bottle.",3
10836,so far I like the products but they both smell disgusting and the black soup is chunky liquid (if that makes sense) not in bar form.,4
10837,Great product. Much too small a quantity to be useful. The lights are quite pleasant.,4
10838,"It massages the gums, and flushes between the teeth. Several heads for different effects. Fill the reservoir with warm water.",4
10839,I am not sure it stops itchiness completely but it certainly makes the after swim less chlorinated and less itchy.,4
10840,"Excellent product and packaging of item was great, no damage.",5
10841,Great for keep clothes up that may peep some skin.,4
10842,"Gives it that full look,  especially for thin hair.",5
10843,it was a pretty good products. I just wish it could have been a little more durable.,4
10844,it comes right off if u get it wet. lick your lips of have a drink and it will flake right off.,1
10845,Destroyed my eyelashes after a month or so of occasional use.,1
10846,Doesn't smell too strong it does smell great but not too strong I love really strong smelling soaps.,3
10847,I think this product is a scam!  I should of known it was too good to be true!  It does not work at all.,1
10848,Love them!!!! No burn totally smooth!!!,5
10849,Took weeks to be delivered to me. I do not think that are worth the wait.,1
10850,This product is for oily skin too harsh for regular skin. Your face look like a ghost just white dry and dull.,2
10851,"This is a nice beard trimmer. However, it appears that the trimmer I received has a defective rechargable battery.",3
10852,"This product helps to remove food where flossing can not reach. However, not as great as I had hoped.",4
10853,The base unit is too light and moves around when you try to use the pic.  Otherwise it does the job well.  Inexpensive but good.,4
10854,I have had it 2 weeks and it has already started coming apart.,2
10855,one stop working a week after i had it.i push the start button and nothing happen.have no return address/?yhank you,1
10856,Much different than the way it used to smell years ago.  Too overpowering!,1
10857,"Its not what i expected, I took it with me to my little vacay, and i was so disappointed, it lacks heat.",1
10858,This curling iron is poor quality. Teeth slide out.,4
10859,Tried this out didn't see any difference and it was a bit difficult to apply.,2
10860,"I found the mittens really god for healing my aching hands!  While they are excellent, they also get really hot after a awhile! Take care!",4
10861,Only came with tag.  No toe tag.  Chain is short.  Expected a little more out of this.,3
10862,My daughter in law uses it on grandsons eczema works great,5
10863,These pens are the perfect size to put in my diabetic meter bag. Thank you so much!,5
10864,Looks real but hurts the crap out of where ever you put it on,3
10865,"The product is as advertised but when it came to me, the cover was not clean. An i would prefer the price will be much cheaper.",4
10866,Concerned about smell at first but seems to be just like my more expensive brand. So far so good and will purchase again.,4
10867,love it! I just wish it would last longer. it is definitely worth it!,4
10868,overall they were great they just don't apply as well as I want them to but not for an everyday use,4
10869,"Very disappointed.  Cleansing clothes are far more efficient, convenient, and more easily carried in my handbag.",2
10870,"High quality product, easy to spread eye shadow evenly.  Make my makeup perfect.",5
10871,Not a very sharp razor...not impressed. I had to use my Gillette pro Glider to finish shaving....,1
10872,"Love these blades, and at this price I have stocked up!! Way less then in the store!",5
10873,"The first time I turned it on the switch went bad and would not shut the unit off.
A piece of crap!",1
10874,It looked clear in the picture so I was kinda upset when it turned out to be silver,3
10875,i got all of mine in purple so that kinda sucked and it left me a hole,3
10876,"Still too soon to tell, but I can feel it working when applied.",4
10877,Great product. Cleans thoroughly with nice fragrance and lots of lather.,4
10878,"So much smaller than I anticipated.  I have no use for them, waste of money.",1
10879,Didn't come with colors. And hard to put on at first. I guess practise makes it kind of easier,3
10880,"It said the bars would be acrylic, but they are steel. Which i am highly allergic to.",1
10881,just did not last me enough as the one i bought at my local beauty supply store...this makes me wonder......,3
10882,i like it its useful and  it helps your teeth  i just do not use it frequently  and shipping was fast,4
10883,I like the results so far. However I think I need to get another bottle to be able to really see results.,3
10884,Wonderful texture. It's so smooth and has the most beautiful shade that's almost natural. It also smells delicious which is a great bonus.,5
10885,The shaver/groomer works ok but it doesn't cut very close at all.,3
10886,Did not work on my thick hair like I wanted it to.,1
10887,I absolutely love this scent ever since the first time I tried it.  I hope Thymes continues to make it.,5
10888,Have used this for years to take off my makeup.  Wouldn't go without it.,5
10889,"I have several of these (3612) razors. The only thing that wears out is the cutter.
Low cost solution for years of shaving.",4
10890,"Useless. You should just buy whipped cream, it's cheaper and it will have the exact same effect.",1
10891,I love this cream.  It makes my dry peely skin feel great and helps keep the flakes to a minimum.,5
10892,I got my this  for my wife for Christmas and she like it.,4
10893,"Exactly as described. They do seem to stretch out but I am very happy with them, the price is just a bonus!",4
10894,"I make the cleaner last longer by removing and re-capping it.  I only clean when I charge the battery, about once every 1 - 2 weeks.",4
10895,They all smell the same...or at least not unique enough to tell the difference.,3
10896,Just got this product today and I do feel a tingly and numb feeling I hope it works.,3
10897,"Detangles our daughter's hair well, smells nice.  would buy again.",4
10898,Perfect for those in between times. My wife swears by it.,4
10899,i like my earrings i havnt wore them yet but there very pretty im planning on buying more jewerely from you guys,5
10900,Love this koozie.  I've had for about 1 year now and it's still going strong.  And it's pretty :),5
10901,"Emits a very yellow light, was definitely expecting  white or bright white.",3
10902,"I don't have much to compare this against since I've always used this brand, but it works pretty much as expected for me.",4
10903,one of the bottles was broken when it arrived. Gave a lot of powder. Nice for a first time trying to do acrylic nails.,4
10904,I love these when they work. Unfortunately they fail rather quickly. Both of the products that I purchased failed in less than 60 days.,1
10905,This item does not have a seal at all. Usually either the box or makeup itself has a seal on it. :(,1
10906,"Misleading description of this product...it is not a moisturizer, it is a gel!
 Very ticked and will be returning.

A.",1
10907,"Works okay.  Thought it would get a little hotter than it does, but does help style.",3
10908,It has not effect on my skin!! I thought it was a fake one!!! no changes at all,1
10909,The teeth on the brush have broken off in spots. Only used a little. The plastic body seem very light and flimsy.,2
10910,"Powerful jet, seems to get rid of small food particles without irritating my gums.",5
10911,"Used to use Doterra tea tree on my skin for acne, which worked really well. This one does not work as well",3
10912,Can't write nothing positive or negative yet.  I've start using this product a couple of weeks ago.  No difference yet.,3
10913,"Its a lot smaller than I imagined, so I gave it to my hubby and its perfect for him!",4
10914,"It does work, butI don't care for the powdery residue it forms after it dries....makes a mess of your underwear.",3
10915,"forget floss, with this thing it's amazing what comes out from between your teeth!",5
10916,Use it to exam the nerve. It does not have a clean finish. It looks cheap but it is cheap. Works well,3
10917,Love this floss. Does not shred and does not get stuck in my back teeth.,5
10918,I love the stand. Holds my razor and my badge or brush just right I have two of these and I wouldn't be caught dead without them,5
10919,"I have used a waterpik in the past, but the portable one that I had did not hold enough water.  This one is great.",4
10920,I didn't particularly like this soap. I was hoping it would smell better than it did. No need to buy it again.,2
10921,"Love the fragrance, but it is so light it is almost non-existant.  Would not purchase this product again.  Would like a slightly stronger fragrance.",3
10922,"Works well enough, but doesn't cut near as close as I had hoped it would. It's quiet and easy to clean.",3
10923,"Only one in package,  no strings.  Picture is misleading",2
10924,Great stuff for soaking up oil and creating long lasting oil. I have 4 stars because it can leave your hair feeling a bit tangled.,4
10925,OK but burns your eyes. The product works but I can't use it on my forehead when working out because my eye start burning immediately...,3
10926,"This stays one well, but it can be painful to peel off in the morning",3
10927,"These are awful. They are very dull from  day one, it basically rips the hair off your skin.",1
10928,The items were pretty and a neat shower idea but were def over priced:(,3
10929,I like it because it's cheap and within expectation. I can split it with my family. It saves me a lot of trouble and money.,4
10930,"Too large for wound, not able to cut to smaller size. No adhesive.",1
10931,"The sticky wax is not for beginners so Im going to get the hard wax, everything else on it is worth the money!",4
10932,"it really is just hydrogen peroxide, and the design of the bottle makes it difficult to use",2
10933,"Really works, just need to use with small doses.",4
10934,"This was great until I read the full ingredients and it has artificial dyes. My bad for not checking.  Delivery, etc was great.",1
10935,This made my fine hair really limp.  Had to send it back.  Might work better on thick hair.,1
10936,"Ordered for my husband for Christmas.  He loves how it shaves.  Replaced on older version, but the price was in our range.",4
10937,"Compared to the Norelco razors I've used in the past, this one is very fragile. One tap in the wrong place and it's toast.",2
10938,"Works as expected.

Now I just need to get into the habit of using it daily.",4
10939,"doesn't follow curves, still need to trim with scissors. My husband's ManGroomer works better for following the curves in.",2
10940,Great color. Natural look for day. Matching lip gloss. Need a new brush through to put on flawlessly . Will buy again.,4
10941,Nice and very sturdy. My razor and shaving brush sits perfectly. A must have product,5
10942,Really strong pechuli oil smell with not even a hint of grapefruit. Too strong for our needs.,1
10943,Been using this shaver for years now. Doesn't last forever but works really well. I highly recommend it. Gives a great shave,4
10944,"If you're looking for cheap travel, on the go brushes these are it",3
10945,"Had to return, brush tips broke easily.  You get what you pay or...",1
10946,Cheap plastic. Not sturdy at all. Broke after 4th time using it.,1
10947,This is a good product & goes a long way.  The scent is pleasing to the noise & favorable to the linen. Good Deal!,4
10948,Very effective aftershave product. Soothes and smooths the face and always gives me the desired result. I will highly recommend it.,5
10949,Not drying out the skin. Leaves it clean and fresh.,5
10950,They got ruined immediately the string comes off ... I am so unsatisfied this was a gift ... not happy w/this purchase,1
10951,"The fragrance was alright, not like the other plain Nag Champas, but I won't order those again.",3
10952,Beware. Mine lasted not quite six months before it quit working.,1
10953,This is a great product! Delivered on time and makes my mouth feel clean!,5
10954,"Why expensive product?, like the title saids all purpose, It is great, cheap, and comes with amazing accesories.",5
10955,"broke first use the brushes fall off at the handle ,  but they were soft brushes so i give a star for that",2
10956,seems like good product-we will see what the dentist has to say in a couple weeks,4
10957,Didn't give me the glaze I expected.  Beauty products are always hit or miss and trial and error. Thanks for the effort though!,1
10958,It came really fast but it didn't look polished like the advertised picture so it's a 4 star :/,4
10959,this must be a two person contraption.  I cannot figure it out by myself plus it must be for those with thick hair.,1
10960,It is very good product and has helped me getting rid off tooth sensitivity,4
10961,I thought these were bigger. I didn't realize they were fingernails until I got them in the mail. Completely my fault.,5
10962,A solid blade choice.  A little sharper than the Derby's I have.  Can't wait to get some more use out of them.,4
10963,Some of these brushes I use all the time....some of them the brush is rough and the brush hair falls out every time I wash it,1
10964,"It was tinier than I expected it to be, and it was drying to my skin.",3
10965,"Great Product; has the best vitamins, minerals and herbs.",5
10966,They fit in my purse easily and are available when I am eating out.,5
10967,"Simple, no frills case that protects my iPod touch and looks good.  I wanted an inexpensive, functional case, and this fits the bill perfectly.",4
10968,"You don't need to know how often I apply this product that's personal!  Don't ask personal questions like that, it turns me off.",4
10969,Keeps your electric razor clean and lubricated. I've been using this product for years and it works great.,4
10970,Beautiful product!  Really amps up the fancy factor on my bathroom counter.,5
10971,This du-rag ripped within a few days of having it!!,1
10972,Rather long - but they are a nice gray that hides in my hair.  Just wish they made a shorter version.,3
10973,Looks horribly single tag with a really small chain cant even get it on my neck.,1
10974,Not sure if these actually block all uv rays. My eyes feel super sore now in sunlight after using these in the tanning bed,3
10975,My daughter has straight hair. I got this conditioner hoping it will smooth my daughter's dry hair. Didn't work at all.,1
10976,"The only concern is that the tape shows ,if your hair moves  other than that it's great. Thanks .",4
10977,Does what it was designed to do while looking good.  What more is there to say?,4
10978,The larger side is too small to fit any of the brushes i had,1
10979,no wonder these lost favor- not enough pressure to really clean,3
10980,Used it once and did cut hair well. Waited to long to try it and can't return it now.,1
10981,"Got this for my son as a gift and he loves it -- looks great in his bathroom , does the job .",5
10982,"Breaks too often, otherwise good for sliding into tight places.",3
10983,"Shipping was fast, but the quality is reay bad. It broke within seconds of wearing it.",2
10984,"Nice design and all, but it don't do the job, I have had better shavers for lot's less money.",1
10985,High quality. Smells delicious. I use it as a toner. Makes my skin feel smooth.,5
10986,"This was a gift for my granddaughter who just got braces.
She said it worked great.  That is high praise from her.",4
10987,It's good kind of but it breaks off in like 2 or 3 months,2
10988,Clip does not hold well to shirt pocket. Also a bit to small,2
10989,The blades make a lot of noise and pull at my beard instead of cutting it cleanly. I put my old blades back on. Very disappointed.,2
10990,"Love this kit, except for the leaking bottle upon opening. 1/3 of the bottle had leaked.",3
10991,Not as good as we had used in the past.,2
10992,Cute but too small. Doll doesn't sit well on it.,3
10993,color is lighter than purchased in the past. Revlon always leaves me more ash/ yellow than i am. Kind of cakey. Not my favorite.,3
10994,"This was perfect
It's super moisturizing a
I think it's a beautiful color and lasts all night
I'm in love with elf now",5
10995,I'm new to DE blades but so far I am very happy with this blade.  It provides a close shave without irritation.,4
10996,biggest complaints goes on the noise of the trimmer thanks to the vacuum and very unprecise cut of the beard,2
10997,works well. until I bought the series 7. Much better,4
10998,it was smaller than i initially thought it would be. and it does not look like 3000+ to me. a lot fewer,3
10999,"Thought it would spin on it's own, but so far I'm liking it ok.",3
11000,Can't return policy is crappy. This brush SMELLS HORRIBLE when you turn it on it is disgusting musty moldy and sickening.,1
11001,works good I like that it is not messy to put on.,4
11002,NO HANGING LOOP AS SHOWN. NOT SURE IT IS AN ORIGINAL PRODUCT,1
11003,"Doesn't work well, though provides some level of desensitization but not enough for prolong period. Stud 100 spray is more effective.",2
11004,works better than other pricey hair supplements i have used. I use it in conjunction with the Keratin supplements from Toji.,5
11005,Purchased this for my daughter and not even 5 mins in use and the lights won't turn on. Such a waste of money!,1
11006,"While the toe buddy separates first and second toes, it does not align the second toe with the others, which limits its usefulness.",2
11007,"The beard trimmer is good but I don't care for the moustache trimmer,it was a lot better on my old one.",3
11008,I do really like this cleanser it has a great scent and it has really evened out my skin tone and balanced my combination skin.,4
11009,The back was too short but I still use it.,3
11010,It's OK I had a hard time with the labels.,3
11011,"As everyone else said, this is the worst design ever and it doesn't stay up.  Don't waste your money on this!",1

11013,love it love it love it everyone thought how did you do this flower?,5
11014,"It was supposed to come as a pack of two, but I only received one tube.",1
11015,Nose ring is too thick & too long . It scratches the inside of my nose,1
11016,"Bottle was not sealed, came open during shipping and leaked all over. If it wasn't for that I would rate 5 stars.",2
11017,Don't buy anything less than these Wilkinson blades  Very close shave with no nicks,4
11018,Watch it will drip and stain clothing is have bought this first several years and the product has been changed,3

11077,i feel like the picture is better looking then the actually piece was not what i expected but hey it was cheap so you get what you pay for,3
11078,It definitely works but only keeps its adherence for about 2 weeks. This is a good product but would be great if it lasted longer.,4
11079,"It's alright, but you're better off getting the Dove version of this since it lasts way longer and won't hurt you with the cordage.",2
11080,"It looked good for the most part, a little bit confusing but ok.",1

11089,I like this product it will help to get rid of blemishes quicker! It helped me get rid of one quicker!  Would buy it again,4
11090,You will lose hair first before any new growth appears. The results are minimal so the investment is not worth the results.,2
11091,"Love this stuff, wish I could get it locally.  Also wish it would arrive a little quicker.  I would recommend to anyone",5
11092,"The products arrived earlier than i expected, but the expire date is too near. Some of the powders stick together in clumps",4

11104,Love this stuff very much. It seems to work pretty well and it smells amazing.,5
11105,Always misplacing mine so picked up a couple spare ones.,4
11106,Excellent product. Really works! And I have sensitive skin so typically am unable to use these types of products. Great!,5
11107,"Lubricates and cleans for a closer shave.  Easy to use, works as promised. Needs to be un scented and dye free.",4
11108,Hardly warms up - and takes forever to even get a little warm.,1
11109,The cap was too small and the elastic was too tight.,1
11110,"Does the job, nothing spectacular.  Its the same stand that is sold under many names, but the price is better.",4
11111,These brushes are great!! I'm a somewhat heavy make up user and the brushes are soft and precise.,4
11112,It worked!  My child and a friend of mine did not complain of itchiness from chlorinated water when they used this product.  Highly recommend!,5
11113,Didn't .won't ever order again.it made my hair hard.,1
11114,"Too dark for my hair, plus I didn't care for the way it colored my scalp.",3
11115,Wish it worked but it did not. It is not irritating to skin but did not accomplish what I had hoped.,2
11116,It's OK. I was hoping for an improvement in my skin.,3
11117,Color to brassy/pink.  Gave it to my daughter and she thought the same.,2
11118,this definitely extends the life of pricey nail polish.  But I wish it included something like an eyedropper in order to facilitate adding it to the polish.,4
11119,I received these they look like factory seconds the printing on them was so faded that you could hardly read printing on them I returned them .,1
11120,"Purchased this as a gift with for a new Ipod Touch 5, and my son loves it.  The color matches the Ipod.",4
11121,Good alternative for regular floss but not as effective. I still do regular floss some time this is just an alternative to save some time.,4
11122,I can't even use it.  It doesn't stick to my lips at all.,1
11123,"Its a good brand, just don't buy during summer.",4
11124,was uncomfortable to wear and band was tight around my head only used it once ruined my hairdo on the night I got it done,1
11125,I use it once a day and it has done wonders for my gums because it cleans out very successfully between the teeth and also stimulates the gums.,4
11126,This product is very reasonably for the price & I will re-order again when needed. Thanks again for your service.,4
11127,"Beautiful artwork and design. Could have been just a bit thicker, but it's great.",4
11128,These bros are so nice! They gave me some cool stickers and and extra gift. I won't hesitate to buy again! Thanks again dudez!,5
11129,for the price is the best you can get. I have used better quality blades but at a much higher price.,4
11130,The product never came - they took my money then disappeared.  Not even worth giving them a star. I want my money back.,1
11131,"Love it! Looks great on my bathroom sink. Level, sturdy, well-made. Perfect fit in finish and style for my Merkur 34C.",5
11132,Not a lot of power because battery operated but just 'okay'.,4
11133,"great product worked and fit perfectly, would buy again.",5
11134,Refills arrived as expected. They fit perfectly and perform their job well. We're glad to be able to subscribe to this.,5
11135,"It's very good, especially for one person.  My main criticism is that the tank isn't as large as on the older model.",4
11136,Tons of colors.  Super pretty and brought.  Hard to remove with makeup wipes.  No smudge.,4
11137,just didn't work well for me.  Returned with no issues tho.,2
11138,The nose pare that connects the two sides sticks out too much for me.,4
11139,I've used this product for years and was so happy to see it available for order on amazon.  It really works.  No more razor burn!,4
11140,he was 110 volts. We did not know that it happens and it immediately burned .I really wish there was a warning about this,1

11142,"Perfect product that performs as promised, leaving my legs smooth and moisturizer.  No fragrance. Just natural.  Love this product!",5
11143,"It's your basic moisturizer. It helped with my dry cuticles, but I think vaseline would have worked the same.",4
11144,"The magnet is so strong, it hurt by end of day and left an indent on my nose. But its fun for once in a while",4
11145,"It accentuates my eyelashes more than just mascara
before the jewish Sabbath, I use it since I do not apply mascara on the Sabbath.",4
11146,Only four stars because of the cost. I still keep buying it anyway because I like it!,4
11147,I wish it is a little firmer than actually it is. The material is too soft.,3
11148,It cracked after one use. It should be more durable.,2
11149,Not sure if it's really toning. Not my favorite toner.,2
11150,It is very pink. Even after layering it is PINK!!!!!!,3
11151,I really like the bracelet and the design but when I opened the package the bracelet was bent . Overall i think it's really nice .,4
11152,You get what you pay for. good durable belly rings but ugly designs but happy.,4
11153,Don't waste your money on this pos.  The stem won't screw into the base.  Very wobbly.,1
11154,Great - they do exactly what you need them to and the stickers are cute to boot.,5
11155,This hairspray is the perfect alcohol free solution for my curly hair.,5
11156,"Very nice fresh rose scent. I think it would work well as a room spray, skin spritzer, or linen water.",4
11157,"Works great, gives a good night sleep after a long hot bath.",4
11158,Hair lost curls after a couple days and is matted and sheds a lot. I do not recommending purchasing. Wefts are not uniformed.,1
11159,Acquired an allergic reaction to this. This was second time I used it. One eye  was swollen and crusted over underneath.,2
11160,"Its very cute. But the neck-chain was damaged and also owl eye was not good. When contacted seller, got full refund.",3
11161,Helen of Troy products always great!  Cost is nominal; value phenomenal!,5
11162,first time i have used this product and it works well,4
11163,Did not work. Actually increased sensitivity. Ended up buying toothpaste and mouthwash with argine. That worked.,1
11164,"Doesn't do a great job, but I just needed one to keep in my car for quick touch ups.  Ok for this purpose",3
11165,"This smells really good, but has a waxy build feel and build up to it. I will not use it again.",2
11166,It works good. Only 2 speeds one is too low and one is too high. It will travel well and its nice an lightweight.,4
11167,Love my waterpik and so does my dentist.  Just had a six-month appointment and checked out great.  Does a better job than flossing.,5
11168,greasy and leaves shine all over the face...will have to assume that it does what it says it does,3
11169,"glitter only on top, after top is gone its regular color but still ok",3
11170,"I didn't like the Fresh Breasts. You have to wait until it dries to dress.
Anti monkey butt powder is awesome.",3
11171,"I'm so disappointed. I wanted to like this, however, I've seen zero results and the smell is really bad!",1
11172,Totally worth the wait. They make blow drying and flat ironing my hair much easier. I have curly frizzy hair. These are a must lol,5
11173,Really salty. I don't mean it's not good. It's just too salty,3
11174,"Love! It does what is says!!! The tip goes on like a marker. It has great staying power, and does stain.",5
11175,"Smells amazing for the price, but a little too alcoholic.",4
11176,"These are terrible. Half of the gems were glued in crooked, some nearly sideways, and the metal irritated my nose.",1
11177,"Very good product. May not last long, but does not take a lot of spraying to do the job. Recommended and would order again.",4
11178,I love these product and my daughter have used each one of them.,4
11179,"Leaves me greasy and while the initial smell is pleasant, it ends up making me stink after awhile.  I do not like this.",1
11180,It's a little drying but the color is very Beautiful.,4
11181,Avalon did not blend well into my skin .......  I have dry skin but i felt it was too greasy for me,3
11182,i like it butt is not as easy too clean up but for the price it is ok,3
11183,too light ... loses charge and the accesories keep breaking now and then ....fragile,2
11184,It's getting harder and harder to find Dental Tape in the usual drug stores.,5
11185,"The title pretty much says it all.  If this works, great.  However, getting this thing to work is the issue.",1
11186,"The razor provides a fairly comfortable and close shave, but it lacks a sensitive skin setting which was available in older models.",4
11187,The brush heads that came with the tooth brush were a bit too big so I replaced them with Phillips smaller kids size and they work great.,4
11188,I love this soap. The smell is great and I can still smell it on me long after I've showered.,4
11189,"For the price, I got what I expected. They work great. there is a little fallout in the bristles but I would recommend.",3
11190,"They are too fragile and too soft.  They are one-use disposable.  Because they are too soft, they don't spread toes far enough.",2
11191,The tip fell off after 1 use. Brush soft and hair gets tangled.,2
11192,dental hygenist recommened trying this because I have a hard time flossing.  this is a great alternative or addition to flossing,4
11193,"I liked it is cute and received it on time,can't give a five star because I don't know how good is going to be.",4
11194,Very happy with this Argan Oil product.  Yes I would definitely order Poppy Austin's product again. Will have to see what other products she offers,4
11195,"The product was advertised as ""perfume"" and it wasn't. Very disappointed",1
11196,My husband uses this every day and say's it gives him a closer and cleaner shave.  It also has a nice scent that is not overpowering.,4
11197,I have  used this product many years and found it to be very good.,4
11198,These do not stick at all. So disappointed! I am disappointed I bought so many.  Won't do it again ever.,1
11199,This product stinks. It does not shave very close. I'm not happy with it.  I will not buy another Gillette product.,1
11200,"when I received the package, the package had a dent on the can",2
11201,nice fruit-floral scent that changes into something like Tide detergent.  Very nice.,4
11202,It broke down after a year. Don't buy.,3
11203,We are very happy with our purchase.  It does what you said it would do and it arrived quickly.  Great seller; great product!,5
11204,"Within the last year, this is my third try at a water pick/flosser. Save your money on the lesser models. This is the real deal.",4
11205,"This is too heavy for fine hair. I actually prefer the SOMA  hot body volumizing gel for my fine, naturally curly hair.",3
11206,This is not anything great.  Not nearly worth what is goes for.  Did nothing for my dry skin.  Shea butter much better and cheaper.,3
11207,I got this for my sons. They loved it!!!.,4
11208,Benzoin is thicker than other essential oils. I use this in moisturizers along with other essential oils.,4
11209,Used specifically for my beard. Works great and easy to clean off wax/balm build up from daily usage. Letter rubbed off within a few washes.,4
11210,I love this product! It's great because the toner gets rid of acne and it soothe with the menthol infused with it!<3,5
11211,Meets my basic needs and works better than expected for the price. Unfortunately replacement blades are too expensive as all shavers and razors.,3
11212,Blades irritate my skin after just one or two shaves. Dirt cheap so I guess I shouldn't expect much,2
11213,I wore this cap several times when I went to sleep. Oil seeps out of the cap and onto my pillows. Not good.,1
11214,"I like the silky feel of the lotion, but I have not noticed any change to the cellulite on my thighs.",3
11215,LOVE the colors but unfortunately the metal turns black. Still a good value even if you only wear each one for 2 weeks and throw them away.,3
11216,I liked Revitalash and it does work. You need to give it about 2 weeks to see a difference. I would buy this product again.,3
11217,Way to small!! Wouldn't give me a refund,1
11218,Love this on my baby's hair it definitely defines her curls and it has a lovely scent,5
11219,"Buyer beware, the hose becomes brittle and breaks in 12-18 months.  Repair kits costs about $10 and requires mid-level handyman skill to replace.",1
11220,OK. I think if it worked better I wouldn't have gotten my haircut short again.,4
11221,My wrinkles are visible when I lean over or wear a spanx top. Didn't work for me.,1
11222,"This is the best anti-bacterial body wash I have ever tried, but not harsh on skin.  I love it.",5
11223,Only a small child could get their hand  in this glove.,1
11224,"Been useing the original for over 12 years, this does not smell the same. Switched back to original.",2
11225,Great customer service - great products in original packaging. Love this blush - lasts all day :),5
11226,I love the packaging--so easy to use and separate. Very bright stones--not cloudy or dull. Many different colors for variety.,4
11227,very satisfied.  have been using it for more than a 1.5 years.  much better than typical brands in drugstores.  color is very beautiful.,5
11228,"Awesome value for the most effective product in the Mitchum line, enough said!",5
11229,Been using this for 25 years ....hard to find but makes your skin look dewy.,5
11230,"Some of the hairs in one of my brushes were already loose when I received it. Other than that, I like em. Cute case tok",4
11231,"gives you a great, deep sleep - but otherwise I saw no difference.",2
11232,Look exactly as pictured! Only thing is that the glitter doesn't stay on for a long period of time.,4
11233,"After using and loving this brand for years, either the company changed the formula or I became allergic to it.  Literally burned my face.  Yikes!",1
11234,"I love it! Although some of the rings were halfway open, I'll have to fix that. Other than that it's very cute!",4
11235,"Smells like ""old lady"" and doesn't seem to work much better than store brand shaving cream. I still get some razor burn.",2
11236,Cute but bracelet does not lay well to read or know what it is.,4
11237,Very useful and the size is good for a medium-sized tote bag,4
11238,"I use Shaver Shebang to refill these, but occasionally you just want a nice new cartridge.",4
11239,"I usually go electric because I'm lazy, but when I need a close shave I'll use this - works well",4
11240,this product is interesting and good product. good factory. this product help for complete anything. is important have this product,5
11241,Very happy with this trimmer.  I bought this one to replace an earlier one that I had been using for years.,4
11242,Its bigger then it shows in the picture. Not as advertised,2
11243,The hand was purchased to display rings and has been doing ths wonderfully since purchased - delivery and price great,5
11244,"And at the price, I have no qualms with replacing them every couple days.",5
11245,Good product that feels nice on the head.  I will order more of these.,4
11246,Appears to be well made. I bought as a gift.,4
11247,These are almost impossible to keep straight on your finger.  Waste of money.,1
11248,I bought this for 9 year daughter but it wasn't effective at all.  I had to switch her to Secret.,2
11249,"It smells like perfume not cologne. Not for men. Do not be confused by the advertised ""cologne"".  I threw it in the trash.",1
11250,Great razor with lots of features and add-ons.  Battery life could be a little better but overall a great product.,4
11251,The smell is good but this product isn't for everyone including myself. I wouldn't recommend this product to be honest. It didn't work,1
11252,I haven't use this hand yet. If you are looking for a Practice Mannequin Hand this will answer your need.,4
11253,"The pot works great , the wax they give you with it
sUCks",1
11254,doesn't meet products high standards EVOO would have the same affect. For the price one should expect more. I do not like it.,2
11255,For the price I can't complain. It looks a little cheap but it is for a costume so I will get good use out of it.,4
11256,"Not sure how to compare as I've not had such in the pas, but I'm happy to have these blades.",4
11257,its a okay body groomer because I have a better one now it does a good job of removing hair,3
11258,"Still has issues with razor burn when used with shaving gel.  Would not have purchased, but was a great deal.",3
11259,My husband used a similar Norelco for about 10 years until it gave out. The new one seems to be even better. Good value.,4
11260,My hair is too fine and gets tangled in the brush.,2
11261,"This was the best of all the Axe line, and they discontinued it. I wish they would bring it back. :(",5
11262,"I liked it, it's very sticky. I wish it were a little bigger",4
11263,"Pretty, but the comb is to close to the design.",3
11264,"This hot brush gives the most wattage and dries my hair quickly wit the amount of curl, straightness and volume I want.",4
11265,How did Americans become convinced they needed to pay several dollars per shave?  These work awesome. Stop wasting your money.,5
11266,"The clarity of my skin has noticeably improved.  I look younger, have fewer wrinkles and firmer skin after using this product.",5
11267,"Awesome pair of scissors. Crazy sharp. Very satisfying snip sounds. However, would have liked the finger holes to be a tad bigger.",4
11268,I enjoyed this wig on hallloween and it was a great hit. I love this and will definitely purchase more in the near future.,5
11269,"Cassia has great benefits,My hair is natural (relaxer free) this is an excellent conditioner.",4
11270,I repleced the original cutters and the razor now cuts better than when I bought it.,5
11271,I WAS REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO USING THIS WITH MY BABY SADLY THIS PRODUCT WAS NOT DURABLE & LEAKED AFTER ONLY ONE USE.,1
11272,It is very effrctive at the begining but I have seen other brands faster results.,4
11273,Why can't someone make a heart shaped candle that smells good and not like a hippie commune or a nursing home ?,3
11274,I like the color selection and the all matte finish but the shadow doesn't seem to have much pigment and staying power even with using a primer.,2
11275,"because I was required to fill out this rating. I haven't used razors yet, but intend to when I fill lake shaving",4
11276,"Wasn't expensive, so it sits in my kit.  I always forget to use it.",3
11277,"You really need to smell this before you buy.  It is not citrus, it's more old grandma musty...",2
11278,So hard to find locally anymore. Love this product.,5
11279,Took me a little bit to get used to it but it works great. I wish I had a shorter one also for shorter hair.,4
11280,water stays inside the handle ...and now im worried about mold,2
11281,"I use this on my daughter before YMCA, dance and birthday parties and haven't had a problem with lice since",5
11282,Took it from the package plugged it in but it never worked. Disappointing..Excited to find one this size but it never got hot.,1
11283,"A little disappointing, Not as good as they used to be!
Bill Graf",4
11284,"A bit flimsy but expected that. Good value, very secure and fast delivery! A+!",4
11285,This is a very nice hair setting gel that is not too greasy yet does the job right. Liked it and will order again. Highly recommended.,4
11286,As far as tips go they are exactly that. But most of mine weren't actually stiletto but had the points cracked off.,3
11287,It feels a little flimsy but I guess if you pay more you get a better brush.,4
11288,"Works great...but a little hard to figure out how to open and insert battery, right outta the box.",4
11289,"In the photo, the chain meets before the navel. The chain I received is far much longer than that..disappointing :(",1
11290,In the description it says it comes with other size blades but it only comes with the attachment combs. Very disappointed,3
11291,It should say somewhere on the packaging it is not water resistant/proof. I am pretty sure everyone shaves their vag in the shower.,1
11292,"Love Zum soap, these are so thin, lucky to last for 3 washings.",3
11293,"Eye patches as expected, good quality. Shipping took a few more days than expected. I use them for ""lazy eye"" therapy.",4
11294,Leaves residue on your hair. Not buying it again!,2
11295,very hard to put on but i love them would buy again,3
11296,"Wish this had a different application process instead of removing the cap every time for use. Other than that, works well.",4
11297,It did noting for me and its too small for how much you pay,1
11298,Razor was priced ok but shaver is not their best. Shaving time takes a bit longer than other models. Holds charge well though.,3
11299,good product. Perfect for making body wash. Use less when using a foaming bottle. Perfect for thickening up thinning soaps.,5
11300,This is very difficulty to roll up even for an adult. The turning mechanism at the bottom is way too tight.,3
11301,I was itching so bad from some medication that I was alerted to and this creams worked perfectly.,5
11302,This shampoo made my hair brittle by morning!  I need moisture and this did not deliver.,1
11303,Beware. Mine lasted not quite six months before it quit working.,1
11304,This is for my mom when she comes to the house.  It's very sturdy and suits her needs perfectly.,5
11305,Waste of my life..  4 of the 29 didn't have gem in them they're all empty,1
11306,"I love the odor, but used alone is too drying.  I use a moisture soap and after rinsing I then use the herbal.",3
11307,"Works well, but when used without the guards for a close shave it tends to cut the skin deeply and frequently.",2
11308,Love this stuff.  So sorry that Bath and Body Works discontinued it.,5
11309,"These razors are decent, but very expensive. I would recommend getting anything by Dorco instead.",3
11310,Actually one of those items that looks better than the photo...really nice quality and chrome...has a nice heft to it as well...,5
11311,Different colors are there but very hard to see. Light blue and light green. Make sure you check under a good light.,3
11312,This is the best product for dry skin on the market and reasonable priced.,5
11313,"The coloring on the balls doesn't come off, which was an issue with other rings.",4
11314,Doesn't do what it says it will do.... Still getting them. Thumbs down,2
11315,I love this smell and I will buy more! Must get this your skin feel so soft and it smells amazing!,5
11316,It is a good idea that doesn't work except for the big toe.,2
11317,"The product is fine, I do not understand the high prices.sometimes you can buy a new razor for about $10-$15 dollars more.",4
11318,"For the price they seam to be cheap , they don't seam to make a clean cut , tend to pull the hair and not cut all",3
11319,My sister ordered me this ring approximately a month ago on December 1st...it's January 3rd and the ring is still not here. Extremely disappointed.,1
11320,Amazing as always.  I order these regularly.  You cant beat this deal,5
11321,"love this shampoo, came very quickly, thank you.",5
11322,I got two extras for others in my family to use the Sonicare unit.,4
11323,Bought this because the oriignal Lever with Aloe was discontinued. Has a mild scent and isn't hard on the skin.,4
11324,I would not buy this again. The top coating came off and the jewelry turned green. I didn't own this long before it broke.,1
11325,"good product- but lacks a light to inform you to recharge the razor, other styles have this feature.
Other than that a good value",5
11326,theyre too harsh but then again it feels good lol except for the scrubbing side thats too extreme,3
11327,"Seriously, don't waste your money! I followed the directions to the T! It doesn't work! I bought younique and it works great!",1
11328,THERE WAS NO QUALITY IN THE ESSENTIAL OILS.  EVEN THE SMELL WAS BAD.,1
11329,Oh my god.. you can not remove it without the cleanser. Best lipstick for a person like me whose lipsticks fade away very quickly,5
11330,leaves my hair soft and touchable unlike other gels.  even feels good the next day. will definately keep using this product.,5
11331,"Still trying to get the hang of these, but they are proving to be very handy.",4
11332,Too much water added...the smell lasts for 3 seconds.,2
11333,Keeps your breath fresh for a very long time. Tastes good too.,5
11334,"I expected them to be a little better quality, they are really not that shiny and get worn down quickly.",3
11335,Nice lipstick cases. They are exactly as pictured and they seem to be durable.,4
11336,"good product, not quite as strong peppermint as the liquid soap but lathers good and seems to be lasting a long time.",4
11337,"This is a terrible product. It fits like a rag, made if cheap fabric.. Save your money and don't buy this product.",1
11338,It does not catch the hair. It's pretty much just a plastic tarp with velcro to fasten around the neck.,1
11339,"this didn't really work out that good for me , but very strong  , which is good in any tape ..",3
11340,"Great scrubby feeling, but too harsh on my skin, wish there was a soft version of this.",4
11341,Okay only. I didn't see this product as being any more effective than other similar organic facial cleansers. This one costs a lot more too.,3
11342,"Very nice case, keeps phone very safe from drops and ports safe from dust or rain.",5
11343,"Love this , I can cut them to the length I want",5
11344,This is my best friend with braces at 42 years old. The waterpik really reaches places that floss and a toothbrush can not reach.,5
11345,Very cheap but for the price I should have known.,2
11346,Good but pay attention to the size of the base. These did not fit our appliance base size.,3
11347,"I've tried this over 10 times hoping it would work, but sadly it makes my makeup look worse and separated.",1
11348,Once you learn to not wash walls with this it really does a great job- love it !,5
11349,These work pretty good. I wish they had a little more moisture in them. They are better than some I've used.,4
11350,Much bigger than pics seems to indicate. Too big:(,1
11351,The only knock on this product is that the blue button to stop the flow sometimes sticks closed.  I have to pull it out with pliers.,4
11352,6 month after purchase prewssure deceased. Now after 8 months it works intermittently.  When at full force it does an excellent job.,2
11353,"The peeling, but after a period of leave it to become a black area...!!!",2
11354,"Tastes Horrible and leaves a film on your teeth.

I guess it gets the job done though...",3
11355,Does the job in between. Easy to apply. Makes hair feel a bit dirty where its applied.,4
11356,I use it everyday.  It hads helped to restore heath to my gums and is as routine as brushing every night.,4
11357,Some other off (CARING) brand pads. Relatively thin. Received 20 in a box that listed a quantity of 25. Wasn't worth returning.,2
11358,"I had this thought she'd like it, she went to Hawaii this year, she loved it and I got her another one.",5
11359,For the most part this set is decent. Definitely worth the money.,3
11360,Its too thick and glisary which is not even mentioned in product feature!!,1
11361,Had the Series 7 for almost a year and use these almost every time after shaving and the razor shaves like new!,5
11362,"My stepfather has said that it has helped his knees and legs.  It helps with the pain, he will consider buying more.",4
11363,"It is great for a small room. Sometimes if you overfill it, the vapor doesn't come out.",3
11364,Flimsy sponges fell apart after only a few used. Sorry I got it.,1
11365,"don't work very well, easy to use. I ended up needing a root canal so maybe I just had too much damage for them to work",1
11366,I keep my hair very short and this trimmer works very well.  It saves me from using a barber.  The vacuum helps contain the hairs.,4
11367,Got a new one but the content does not come out....,1
11368,If you have a conair double-sided lighted makeup mirror - these bulbs are perfect!,5
11369,"Did not moisturize my lips, product sat on top of lips but did not sink in. No bueno.",1
11370,"these show that these slippers are pink in color.  Surprise!  They were not pink!
Other than that major disappointment, they are very good.",3
11371,"I was expecting a bigger container ,didn't last very long.",3
11372,Order came via prime shipping. Can't complain about the product.,4
11373,"perfect for a care package, gift basket or stocking stuffer.",4
11374,My wife enjoys the product and I can see the results..,4
11375,I really like this clay. It works better than the green clay for bringing life back into my face after a good shower.,4
11376,Works well and does not have any components that I am allergic to.,4
11377,"It seems to do a good job exfoliating, but now my skin is always dry and flaky. I have been using the product every 4 days.",4
11378,My husband swears by Norelco and this is his favorite razor so far.,5
11379,Very cute I was surprised how many you get and how professional they look.  I'm Going to give them to my granddaughter for Christmas.,4
11380,Perfect! My daughter is allergic to metal these are perfect for her little ears,5
11381,Good little trimmer. Easy to use and I like that it gives you a choice of lengths,4
11382,Nice but really doesn't brighten or add any shine to my gray hair.,3
11383,I bought it for my father's use and he likes it! it's easy to use and a good price.,4
11384,Still trying to get good results.  The wax doesn't really grab the hair and pull out.,1
11385,"Stuck my hair decently, had to use heat though. Didn't stick well with extensions.",3
11386,They take a long time to glow. And the colors are the same.,3
11387,Not a bad candle...I can see some concerns about the scent but only for those with very sensitive smell.  Overall very calming.,4
11388,"Bought both to try out and compare to LUSH brand, and because the varieties looked interesting.  Lathers nicely, and washes without issue.",4
11389,A lot of rocks/pebbles all through the soap had to keep removing them so they wouldn't scrape my skin,2
11390,This cloth is extremely soft. I use it exclusively for my face and it's a real pleasure to dry my face with.,4
11391,"this thing is great, scrubs all the grody parts quite well",4
11392,"Dries well, but a little awkward to use....too long.",3
11393,el producto es de muy buena calidad y cumpli&oacute; con todos mis expectativas y mas muy buena calidad  z z,5
11394,left my hair feeling greasy and I never felt clean.,2
11395,Caused me to break out in a red rash immediately- had to throw it out. I've never had problems with creams before.,1
11396,"The product is good, but tube is only half full. I feel cheated when the container is much bigger than the contents.",4
11397,Works fine. Got grey color instead of red or black though. Not as nice-looking bit still works as advertised. 2nd purchase.,4
11398,"A bar only lasts for a couple weeks, making this a very expensive soap. It smells amazing and the smell lingers all day though.",4
11399,This is one of those inventions that makes you wonder why  you didn't think of it first....so easy to use and so much more precise.,5
11400,"Great Stuff, love it and recommend the seller, fast with fullfilment",4
11401,Horrible. After an hour my lips look dry and cracked,1
11402,Just what I needed to fit my son's medical grade suction machine,5
11403,"Chain is shorter than expected. But overall, cute for the price",3
11404,"Average face tanner. Gel formula, goes on slightly sticky. Last about 2 days.",3
11405,provides skin with glow and seems to help overall appearance- does not help wrinkles...at all,2
11406,Definitely not 1B color. I was disappointed! It is a lighter color than 1B.,1
11407,waiting on the plastic so they can work their magic together,4
11408,In the discription it stated that it fits the 1000 Series. It does not. I can not even use this replacement.,1
11409,"Very thick concealer, a little bit goes a long way!",4
11410,"it broke right when i got the package and doesnt look like anything in the picture , just looks like a giant rock",1
11411,"worst service ever, i order this thing and never got it, i was charge and i haven't got my money back",1
11412,This were great!  Worked perfectly for my mason jar gifts for teachers.,3
11413,I really like the way this product  enhances my hair's natural curl without being sticky.  Lightweight and non-greasy.,5
11414,"Works great! Looks cool on the counter, too.",5
11415,"The electric razor works like new, now that we have the replacement package for the correct model.  We are very satisfied with the product.",4
11416,My husband and I bought this for ourselves so we would not need wax floss.  Our teeth feel great after cleaning them with this flosser.,4
11417,This Just Didn't Seem To Work At All. No Changes In Anybody. I Would Buy It Regularly If It Worked.,1
11418,"best tighting i have ever seen, and my bathroom is full of a million products",5
11419,"They slip & slide off your glasses after about two week. I would choose a different brand, the adhesive on these aren't the best",1
11420,Great idea just don't like how quickly the adhesive goes away,4
11421,Long time user of this for the kids and works great.,5
11422,Much smaller than I thought. But works pretty good.,4
11423,This might work wor people who shave daily. Does not work for people planning to shave like once a week or longer!,3
11424,"Offers and great hydration to dull, tired skin... just what I need ;) It's lightweight & extremely effective.",5
11425,Love them!! I ordered two so im waiting on the second one to arrive.,5
11426,"Did not find these to be ""soft"" as stated online.  Will keep the extras for guests. Will not buy again.",2
11427,Followed directions as stated however this product still tends to come off after the 2nd or 3rd time.,2
11428,"When you see this many 1-star ratings, listen up.  This is one of the worst electrics I've ever had.  Keep shopping.",1
11429,No this did not erase my wrinkles and deep lines under my eyes,1
11430,"Meh, i just cut it up and use it for my eyebrows, didn't work on my arm pits !? #",2
11431,so far i love it.!! cant wait to see how well it holds for a night out,4
11432,Too big for a toddler to use. Too big for a grown up to brush his/her own toddler's teeth.,1
11433,"Wow, so you can do better than just floss huh?  This thing works well.",5
11434,This is an amazing little device.  It works perfectly.  I have saved a lot of money with this in my salon.,5
11435,Lips got an allergic reaction or something and got swollen. But I seem to get allergic reactions quite easily. Color was nice though.,3
11436,"not bad but you still need to floss,also you need to empty the water every time you use it otherwise it will leak",4
11437,I bought these brushes for a Christmas gift!! I sure hope they enjoy them!!,4
11438,always feels like it's running out of juice but it works,4
11439,"First time I tried to re-attach length guage after using trimmer, gauge broke.  Save yor money.",1
11440,Works fine except the tube that feeds the water is too short! I would NOT recomended for a tall person.,3
11441,"I bought this, because of the reviews, I read. But my lashes look fake with this on. I wanted a more natural look.",1
11442,Great deal- now I can afford to change my blade weekly!,4
11443,Doesn't break easily like other flat dento tape brands.,4
11444,It makes the electric razor glide easier but it really hasn't helped with the irritation that much.,4
11445,These work really well not for a month but for at least 10 days! Which is far greater relief than having to repeatedly applying numbing gel!,4
11446,Great color. Splat seems to last longer than other dyes we've tried.,4
11447,"I love the smell, I have a feeling that after I applied this to my hair it makes my hair a little bit greasy.",4
11448,This is good product does the job it was made for. Keep it around all the time.,4
11449,Great product for people who do not have the time to floss.,4
11450,"The charm says ""One Direction"". As an adult, I wasn't looking for a bracelet with a cheesy boy band name on it...",1
11451,"Good product. Only complaint..the case that the brushed come in, have a funny smell. I guess in time it will go away?",3
11452,My hair is so thick. Hair holds around the brush without slipping. Best grip from the teeth of the barrel. None compare.,5
11453,It lived up to the description.  The pause is really nice.  My old cordless one would lose power too quickly.,4
11454,"These are alright, plain and ordinary but alright. They do what they're intended to do but I wouldn't buy this set again.",3
11455,Item was defective. Did not come sealed and was half empty.,1
11456,product covers gray well enough but I have trouble get precision around the face area.  Spray is wide and tends to get on skin.,3
11457,"They are so cheap that they break, even when you are tearing off from the container. Even if you are very, very careful",1
11458,used for certain dresses to even out the look.  They wear well and clean easy.  They were only used for a specific outfit.,3
11459,Works quite well. I hope it works better than the Spectragel.  I've said all I want to say.  Good bye,4
11460,The scents aren't really what I would call sensual. Aroma therapy more like it.,3
11461,"There are no loops for hanging, as shown in the picture.",3
11462,Wore it once and changed color and can't ever wear it again.,1
11463,I received the product and barely opened it and it was all melted. had to throw it away. such a shame,1
11464,This acne cream just did not work for me. I used it for about 2 months and I didn't see any results.,2
11465,"Smaller than I had in mind, but they work. I like them.",4
11466,Nice rose scent. I add about 15 drops of Jojoba oil to 4oz's of rosewater for a winter face mist.,4
11467,Teeth are too far apart to grip my hair. Holding it with a finger will burn hand.,1
11468,After using up the small tubes I went back to my old products.,3
11469,This cream definately works and I would recommend it for others.,4
11470,I bought this to replace one that I had for a few years.  I thought the price and style was great.  I would recommend this product.,5
11471,Very attractive and solidly built. Excellent for its purpose.,5
11472,"I have tried many electric razors and many, if not all, failed to beat this razor.  The price cost is well worth the purchase.",5
11473,"this is a nice conditioner, expensive but seems to be worth it.",4
11474,No better than the heat creams you can find in any retail store.,1
11475,"This is the perfect cover to protect your new iPod!  It is flexible and soft.  Also, it is very inexpensive!",5
11476,Too sticky and did not work out for me. I would not order again.,2
11477,"This was smaller than I'd expected but gets the job done.  As long as it's for a hardcover book, you're golden.",4
11478,"I love it, I have had absolutely no problem with this product, I even used it with mouth wash instead of water and it worked perfectly!",5
11479,I like this product because I'm an older woman with dry skin and it helps remove the old cells to allow new skin cells to grow.,4
11480,"Bad Smell!
And also cheaply made so it is easily broken!
Look to use it only for 3 months
Really bad!",1
11481,"I like this shaver. I used to buy the disposable ones and I loved them, but this is way more cost effective",4
11482,The blades aren't very sharp. They catch and pull on the hair (ouch!) too often instead of just cutting it.,1
11483,"Good color, and coverage. Does leave my lips dry and I use EOS to cover on top of it.",4
11484,"I still use it, but it never rotated.  It does smooth my hair and give it fullness.  Good for second day hair.",3
11485,"A little too tight fit, but did the job!",4
11486,Easy to use although changing guards is a little tricky. Overall this works really well in all those hard to get at areas.,4
11487,Good VG Not my favorate but it is one of the cheaper prices i've seen.,4
11488,"Smells good when not lit, but gives off an unpleasant odor when lit.",2
11489,Great !!! Stays in place and hasn't broken,4
11490,"Was a little disconcerted that the color was not gold, however, after rereading the advertisement, realized that was my mistake.",5
11491,Love this shampoo.  I have been using it for years...keeps the yellow out of gray hair.,5
11492,Will never use another skin care line ever. This is the best hands down,5
11493,"Great product, I use the flakes for foot soaks and in baths. I feel that it is excellent quality and a fair price.",5
11494,"yes, it would be recommended to anyone
because we like it a lot and we both use it
i chose it because had one before like this",4
11495,"Great item.  Leaves your mouth feeling so clean.
I would recommend this product to anyone.",5
11496,Doesnt work! Total rip off. I was blinded by synthetic lights even while wearing these. ,1
11497,Just what I ordered but I thought it was a 2 inch barrel great for not getting tangled in hair!,5
11498,The bottle is almost empty and haven't seen or felt a change at all. Returning this one  this week for sure.,2
11499,I am sure this would work on short hair better than long thick hair.  Disappointed in product.,1
11500,I need to practice more with this...no that great..,1
11501,Aveeno's is a lot more hydrating but I mix the two and it leaves my skin so soft and moisturized!,4
11502,My husband likes corded shaver and this is a good deal. I would give it 5 stars if it offers closer shave.,4
11503,Previous WP finally ran out of pressure; this version works much more efficiently but seems to be louder than predecessor,4
11504,The reason I chose this rating is because the razor gave a good shave and was easy to the skin. Would recommend to anybody.,4
11505,Irritates sensitive ears.  Pierced well with a piercing gun.,2
11506,my sister in law loves these candles. So i get them for her every year but they are a bit expensive for a relatively small candle.,4
11507,"Love it, a little messy at first. I left the dentist earlier and she felt that I was doing better with my floosing.",4
11508,This fit my Cavendish beaver shaving brush and held my Harry's razor.  Very sturdy.,5
11509,My husband usually shaves his head with a razor so at first it worked ok but after its good just took a little to get use to it.,4
11510,Little bit smaller than I want but price estimate is so great. Very useful and nice.,4
11511,"Worked great, they stay on the board better then ones I had previously purchased from other retailers",4
11512,Works great!  Little to no clean-up.  Just empty the chamber the hair is caught in and you are done.,5
11513,Delivered as promised. Spouse & mother-in-law extremely satisfied...earned buku brownie points on this one.,5
11514,Fantastic - highly recommend. Leaves legs soft and smell is great. I hate the word requirements on this... what else am I supposed to say?,5
11515,these card sleeves are really cool but after a month and a half of having them they start to tear but overall their great,4
11516,"Incredible, after 1 night of use I saw results. Also, it is very comfortable, you barely know it's there while you sleep.",5
11517,Mine broke after less than two weeks. it simply stopped working! I didn't drop it or anything!,1
11518,Do not buy!! You can get it for 3 bucks at Target!,1
11519,"This type of hot air brush works well for my hair.

I would buy this again only with a smaller barrel size.",4
11520,Rhinestones aren't that shiny and the container is small comparing too the picture,2
11521,Tried skintac first with no luck. Once this arrived it worked like products I use to use in veterinary.,4
11522,Love this product!!!! I've been using it for years and my bone density has improved. Also keeps me feeling great.,5
11523,this one doesnt really work for me/.. this make my skin more sensitive.... smell not that ok... not recommend . .,1
11524,"Stopped working after just a few uses, exchanged for a new one and had the same problem with the new one.",1
11525,It can get all over hands and smudges easily. But the colour is awesome. Working on new tricks to prevent how easy it is transferred.,4
11526,Very very thick cream and very strong smell leaves my hands with a lot of oil left on them not for me,2
11527,"vry bad poor quality, got broken when i tried them on me
poor material. don't buy it",1
11528,Did not work for me. Lots of people say it works - just did nothing for me.,1
11529,Works well but still a little tacky even after 5 minutes. Leaving me with needing to either stay put longer or risk chips,3
11530,Does have suction but doesn't work as well as using a Q Tip,3
11531,"So disappointed with this product. Don't waste your money, this is cheaply made, finished, and packaged!",1
11532,"Did not come with 20 fingernail tips, could use a better brush....",2
11533,Not a very good quality. It is barely noticeable.,2
11534,"Perfect for keeping hair off the clothes.  It's easy to put on and easy to take off, and easy to clean.",5
11535,I think it works but that could just the placebo effect. Smell nice though and can be layered with another cologne.,4
11536,Cute but small and the little buttons are hard to do alone,3
11537,Good wipes!  I usually can't get my eye make up off but with this one I was able to in just a couple of wipes!,4
11538,"Way toooo heavy , even when I mix it up with my own foundation . Not a big fan .",2
11539,If you have an HP elitepad 900 - do not buy this product. It does not even come close to fitting.,1
11540,Effective at removing food debris from between teeth! Low pressure setting is gentle on gums. Can put xylitol rinse in water container.,4
11541,Kinda silly you have to turn off while holding unit.  Works well.  Overpriced.,3
11542,Wonderful product for my hair and skin!! Love it!,5
11543,Everything was very good and exactly as described. I love the classic-pack cuz its the same result just cheaper package...,4
11544,The smell is just what I want. ..not to strong but nice under layer.  I love the scent.  Very feminine.,5
11545,Won't cover grey. Get Sally beauty supply color.,1
11546,This works great on our daughters' hair that can get very tangled.,5
11547,3 days i found out it brightened  my teeth and gave me a whiter smile in only one weak,4
11548,"Its not what i expected, I took it with me to my little vacay, and i was so disappointed, it lacks heat.",1
11549,Just a bit pricey however with the Braun Shaver it does do a good job keeping the razor clean,4
11550,Perfect color for so many looks yet looks amazing all alone!!  I love it!!,5
11551,"The wife liked it. She said it works fine. Her only complain is, it's too plasticky.",4
11552,"it burns, bad. My eyes swelled shut for 2 days. had lots of green gunk coming out of my eyes.",2
11553,"Brushes fell off the handle. Cheap, cheap cheap.",1
11554,"I absolutely love Eminence products, each and every one of them that I have purchased and will continue to purchase.",5
11555,Ridiculous to try to fit into shoes. I returned them.,1
11556,I bought this as a gift and the cheap plastic parts had broken off. Unusable for even one shave. Sent it back for a refund.,1
11557,It's HORRIBLE!! Made my skin much more oily. I don't think it really works for sensitive skin and those who have acne...,1
11558,"I personally am not the most skilled at using it, but it was a wonderful value for the price and it will serve me well.",5
11559,after 3 days i noticed a visible difference. I would recommend this product to anyone that is looking for a cheaper fix than getting a oppointment,4
11560,I needed to graduate from scissors.  Easy to use and reasonably priced.,5
11561,Just okay. It doesn't really work well with short hair.,3
11562,"Very hard to find elsewhere and good price pack  - I stack those, and hope I will find them again next time",4
11563,Not what I expected. Once you start brushing your teeth the toothpaste foam kinda splashes everywhere. My son hates using it.,2
11564,Not what it looks like the Velcro around the neck is coming off very disappointed,1
11565,"Looks ok,but it was not sterling silver looks terrible after one day. I would not recommend.",1
11566,Love this stuff! Good coverage and washes out easily. Great for growing out grays.,5
11567,this was a item my mother needed while in a rehab center after having surgery. She really loves it.,5
11568,"Nothing like it!!  The best there is in style, ease of using, cleaning & functionality",5
11569,"I love it, but take it out before you shower or bathe for it will get water marks",4
11570,Have used for years.  Bulk price was excellent.  Packaging/delivery fine.,5
11571,"I found this to be a good idea but the material much too stiff and scratchy so much so
That it became an irritant.",1
11572,"I had an allergic reaction towards this, so returend it",3
11573,My teeth have been thanking me since I started using this. I love this product. very easy to use and keep clean,5
11574,"Goes on kinda greasy, very soft.....causing you to use more than you should",3
11575,the braclet broke withen a week and I was very disappointed because I really loved the beautiful amazing design thank you,1
11576,"Fastens with a weird clip, would be better with velcro",2
11577,"I have been looking for flat toothpicks ever since a trip to Scandinavia, but these plastic ones cut my gums unfortunately",3
11578,My 62 year old weathered neck loved it and my face has also responded well.  I will continue to buy it,4
11579,It is suppose to be a rotating barrel.  It doesn't rotate as I expected.  I do like the ability to remove and clean the brush,3
11580,Good purchase. Very nice ingredient list. No chemicals added.,5
11581,Too small. Wanted wider clipper slant edge &  better is stainless steel.,3
11582,Not overly impressed - can't really tell if it helps or not.  I seem to have the same results regardless.,3
11583,Barely pulls anything off  and is not nearly as efficient as hot waxing,1
11584,The unit works very well.  I spend half the time needed to shave that I used to.,4
11585,"I have been pleased with this product in every way.
Buy it, you won't regret it.",5
11586,"Great value and price, smells nice works well for an even tan.  No streaking or staining.  Very pleased with the produce would buy again.",5
11587,I have dental braces so it was quite tough to use dental floss. So for me it was a very helpful tool,4
11588,"I'm not really n love with it, because it sprays all over.",3
11589,The cotton fabric stretches and makes it not stay in place,2
11590,"I love the fragrance.  The service was excellent.  I will definitely use this service again, and I have already begun to recommend it to friends.",5
11591,Love this shampoo! Recommended by a friend! Color really lasts!,5
11592,"Got none of the ones in the picture and half of them are plastic, bs",1
11593,OK had a hard time keeping it on while sleeping but good product! Actually find essential oils work better!,4
11594,For the price good blades . I don't have a heavy beard and about 3 good shaves  per blade.,4
11595,This is really thin and really cheap. Mine started coming apart after a couple scrubs.,3
11596,I don't think it shaved any better than the Braun Shaver.  Unfortunately Norelco came out with the newer model just after I had purchaed the 9160XL,3
11597,Bought this set for my daughter. Everything worked out great except two of the nails chipped off before the next day. Loved the instructions.,4
11598,Love it. Because of the grip I haven't dropped it yet! Lol,5
11599,This brush seems too powerful for my 1.5 year old but he will grow into it. It's worth it for the price.,4
11600,Cleaning power is great but.....the blue button on the handle is sticking. And we have only had this product a few weeks.,2
11601,Never got to use because the wig I got was very bad,4
11602,Gloves are a little loose but they do work! You can feel a difference when your hands are under the light,4
11603,A wonderful warm and exotic scent. Plus long lasting! I will buy these over Pacifica ANY day.,5
11604,Great product and it got me earlier than quoted by Amazon Prime,5
11605,Haven't felt or seen any effects are using this product...not much better than Vasoline.,2
11606,"The bigger rollers do not bend, but the rest of them work great. next time i will only buy the smaller ones.",3
11607,My husband could have blown on my hair and it would have dried faster.  It also turns itself off pretty quickly.  I returned it.,1
11608,Does not work. I wanted to return it but realized I misplaced the box. When I found the box it was past the allowable return date.,1
11609,Have used these brand for years but the body powder does not seem to be available in any store but the body splash is.,5
11610,"I shave my head with these everyday. They work great, and are cheap enough to use a new blade every couple of days.",4
11611,Ink complaint is it's a little shimmery than I wanted. But not bad.,3
11612,I've only had this bag for less than a week and the button popped off. I love this bag a lot except that part,4
11613,My husband uses these.  He likes that there is a rough side along with the normal loofa.,4
11614,This is a super nice wig! I love it a lot and have received a lot of compliments!,5
11615,My facial skin has improved. Will continue to use two times a week as was suggested by my antinestitian,5
11616,Irritates the skin.  Vitamen C serums are much better. Tremendous effect and nonirritating.,4
11617,Good for doing things which a sharp tip scessors can not do.,5
11618,Like that it is environmentally friendly.  However to soft for my taste. Product came in perfect condition and quickly.,3
11619,Best hand cream EVER. Dr Recommended. But this Formula is so thick I must squeeze tube very hard to get it out.,4
11620,"Been wearing this perfume for many years, can only find it on Amazon now.",5
11621,"Very, very temporary. Washes right out. Even on bleached hair and extensions.",3
11622,One eye piece fell out after one use. The string is holding on by a thread.,1
11623,"Great product, but leaks a little when placing water reservoir back onto body.  But, it does get my 9 year old to brush and floss better",4
11624,Wish it came in a spray bottle... I spilled like a quarter of it by accidentally dropping it,3
11625,"good deal for your money, many different colors, quality not the best. the shine is mainly gone with top coat",3
11626,"The fragrance is great, but not lasting.  It permeates the bathroom for awhile, without a strong smell.  The bar lathers up nicely, also.",4
11627,This did help but not quite strong enough for the area we needed it for with three female dogs.,4
11628,The heads of the brushes fell off at least 4 of the brushes. They ended up in my trash can within one month of purchase. Sad.,2
11629,"Fits my brush and razor perfect, love it so far.",5
11630,The batch I just got is aweful and comes apart after 2-3 uses. I bought 4 and will be returning them,1
11631,Floss is great. It is strong and does a great job cleaning all the nooks and crannies. Well worth the money.,4
11632,I bought this for my son and he loves it.,5
11633,"It felt down after hours, and I didn't find it.",1
11634,This is my favorite face cream ever! It works wonderfully.,5
11635,Helps with candida. Great taste and this seller is very good.,5
11636,Worked great for about a month. Then it started leaking all over the sink. Can't figure out why. Don't waste your money.,1
11637,This left a grimy residue on my skin. I don't recommend it.,1
11638,It is so pretty I love it! Differently a long belly button ring goes past the start of my pants but I'm in love with it,5
11639,All of the little black teeth are falling out! Not a very good curling iron.,2
11640,I do bot like that this lotion is so greasy.  It's not long lasting and needs to be applied very often.  Works great for chapped lips,2
11641,Acrylic powder and monomer didn't work well as brush got hard very fast so after 1 use I couldn't use again.,2
11642,Nice oil. Use it on my face. Don't notice much of a difference from extra virgin olive oil.,4
11643,I feel my tooth clean and comfort after using it. But a little inconvenience is that it can only be used five minutes whin 2 hours.,4
11644,"The curling iron doesn't get hot enough to curl hair, it leaves hair straight and limp so I rate it as worthless!",1
11645,many time I was ordered it. Because this is very useful and good price. easy to use.  good good good,4
11646,short battery life between charges; but well made with pain free hair removal for a better price than most similar makes,4
11647,I don't care for the fabric it's made of. It's too stiff.,2
11648,Strong glue but not a fan of the black color as I have blonde hair. Needed clear.,1
11649,"Smells good enough.  Not my favorite incense.  But hey, it covers up the smell of some other smoke.",3
11650,Ordered this for my daughter to cover a tattoo and she states it is a fake product and didn't cover anything.,1
11651,I ordered two of the brackets for my nieces! They loved them.  Good material and very true to size and colors.,4
11652,"Pow!!! THIS IS SOME GREEEAT $***!!!
Covers up my burnt HERB perfectly!!!",5
11653,"Bends super easy, and the back pieces are a struggle to get on.",2
11654,"It works fine, not quite as well as Decollette Pads by Calvet Cosmetics but it will do. Cheaper isn't always better!",3
11655,This soap has a great lather and moisturizes nicely but the smell is disappointingly faint and not at all like sandalwood.,3
11656,Not the best but for 50 for 10$ can't go wrong with that.,3
11657,"i do not want this item and it totally was not what i was expencting
i am trying to figure out how to return it",1
11658,poor quality should have expected that for the price. Get it wet the die bleeds.,1
11659,it was black.  I thought I got light brown.,1
11660,"I have to shave every day ,these blades make that a comfortable experience plenty sharp and smooth and cost effective, definite go to blade.",5
11661,"This stuff is amazing! I was a little scared of spending so much on concealer, but WOW! I love it!!",5
11662,"great for the price, but dull quickly. blades last for two shaves tops.",3
11663,Use this for my natural hair products and this hibiscus powder is by far amazing.,5
11664,I was having trouble finding a Birthday Gift for my 87yr old Dad. He loved this. Simple gift.,5
11665,not a good fitting vest and the zippers are very sharp and scratch your arms!,1
11666,"Is excellent item but is to short, I make a mistake selecting becouse I need one a letter more large.",5
11667,"Not Worth it, Waste of Money, had to get them Sharpen and Adjusted and still didn't cut right.",1
11668,"very nice set for those into this kind of thing , the case pictured does not come with them",4
11669,Really great for the price and size. Bought it for my daughter and she is very happy with it.,4
11670,The barrette was very nice to look at but was very flimsy. It came apart the second time I used it. I was very disappointed.,1
11671,"What a disappointing, uninviting sponge. It's pale, small and ugly. It doesn't look anything like the picture. I do not recommend.",1
11672,Doesnt fit with the led mask that i bought. ***This goggles were recommended with this mask,1
11673,"Horrible. Huge, and very cheap looking. Do not buy.",1
11674,They worked great. No shedding. But with two of the brushes the pink part came off of the white part. Otherwise they're good.,4
11675,"A reliable part of my fibroid shrinkage programme.  Over time, I have been able to reduce the dosage which is a good thing.",4
11676,Love this eye mask; the only one I can wear - doesn't bother your eyelashes with the way it bubbles out over the eyes.,5
11677,"its mouthwash, keeps my breath fresh.......... not sure I can say it helps with whitening, but like the mouthwash aspect of it",4
11678,I really don't kn about this product yet i am still using..not even half way through the jar yetso i will let you all kn if it works..,2
11679,"It comes off much lighter than i had expected and does not last long, however for the price, it was very smooth and easy to apply.",3
11680,"They give you random colors , and they gave me the ugly pink one  but they work good tho .",4
11681,"Like the clay, I have used it with some carrier oil to use as a scrub for face.",4
11682,Seems high quality. Holds my razor and brush perfectly.,5
11683,"These little flowers are so cute,  and they where exactly what I was looking for. I love them!",4
11684,Good starter kit If it's priced right (at the time of your purchase...),4
11685,This was my first time trying this lotion and I loved it. It smells great and it moisturizes your skin well.,5
11686,I find these blades give a good shave for as many as seven days.  Good vlalue.  I thought that Wilkinson had disappeared in the 80s.,5
11687,I would not buy again. Didn't love the results at all. I was expecting much more but was let down. Just ok.,3
11688,Best VG I've purchased so far. Perfect sweet taste.,5
11689,"Well its a good product, it just take a long time too wrong. I guess patiences is everything. Thank you.",3
11690,This is the only product that works for my curly-haired son! Love it.,5
11691,The ears are too skinny and too close together. They don't really look like cat ears,2
11692,"When you use it, it squirts water in your mouth so hard that it goes EVERYWHERE! Definitely not what we expected!",2
11693,I think its good but im not loving it as much as i thought i would.,4
11694,"Still prefer a blade shave, but this razor works fine when you don't want to lather up.",3
11695,I cannot get them to stay in due to the hard plastic  would send back but not worth the time to do so.,3
11696,easier to use than tube and kids like this better.,4
11697,Slides easily and tastes great. Hope it's working well vs less slick alternative.,4
11698,"The shampoo is very watery, and I did not see too much of a difference in my dandruff.",2
11699,This product is great! Very natural tan appearance... Easy to apply,5
11700,"thick and hot, gets dirty, even after cleaning I worry about the problems from prolonged use could create",3
11701,so far so good.  until my son borrowed to cut paper...,4
11702,Enjoyed the colors in both palettes. ..very pigmited. ..but the glitter is only on top. ..not all the way through. ..,3
11703,It did absolutely nothing. Really? Save your money. Used it as directed and even a little extra.more. Nothing. Absolutely nothing.,1
11704,"I Liked my philips sonicare hx8012/64 airfloss, replecement nozzles 2 paks bnecause it is a very good produt
i bought for my daughter and for me",4
11705,These are not helpful or easy to use. I wouldn't recommend wasting your money! Use a sock!,1
11706,This product really grew my lashes I'm two weeks...Love it,4
11707,"This blush stands up to its description, it's a very natural color, not too pink. I would recommend it for light complections like mine",4
11708,Very thin flat lash. Glue doesn't take very well to the extensions.,2
11709,A little goes a long way. Smells great and goes on smoothly. Soft on the hands.,4
11710,It is so great to have a clean and lubricated Norelco Shaver again. I hardly felt the shaver on my face.,5
11711,Great price on these.  They are slightly flimsy but will still work as intended.,4
11712,DESCRIPTION SAID PACK OF (4) IT ONLY CAME WITH ONE.,1
11713,I bought it for my daughter in law and haven't given it to her yet,3
11714,very cheap and artificial look. they are plastic and not soft the look like dolls lashes,1
11715,After using this for about a week or two the painful lumps under my skin completely disappeared. It won't help scarring though.,4
11716,Colors may vary (is this a terrible new trend on Amazon?),1
11717,My kids don't like them even I purchased several different ones including these one.,2
11718,works great. this is the 2nd one we have ordered,5
11719,A very good after shave lotion at a very reasonable price (inexpensive).,4
11720,"i like the colors, but was expecting them to be much thicker and true to the color since they are specifically labeled for stamping.",4
11721,"Nice product, good and sharp.  As good as Gillette.",4
11722,Stopped working after a couple of weeks. Alcohol will not come out when pumping,1
11723,"Simply said, good stuff ... nice fragrance, good lather.",4
11724,My wife uses this religiously.  We have reordered several times.,5
11725,"I purchased these 2 combs from uncell, For $4.58. They're not as big as I expected, but they're pretty strong for the price",4
11726,great product wish it wouldn't leave a trail though.,3
11727,Dr Bronners Peppermint is just the thing for a good mint aroma and excellent wash/clean results. Very happy with the other Bronner soaps as well.,5
11728,This is a great product. I have been using it since two years ago. It is very gentle on your hair!,5
11729,"It's vaseline. Seriously, what's the difference? I thought it would be more of a cream, but it's a vaseline product basically.",3
11730,This works but I have a hard time remember to use it at night.  I can not wear it in the day time.,4
11731,I have used this product for years and I love it.,5
11732,This lip stain stays and it has phermones .. it's pretty cool. It does what it says it will do.,4
11733,Works as expected. This is a supplement to keep your hormones strong.,4
11734,"It does a good jub, just a little slow.",4
11735,This product left my hair really soft and it smells great. It also prevented my hair from burning and reverting,4
11736,"Much smaller than expected, I don't think this size was worth the price.",2
11737,was hoping that it would be a little bit more filled but they are great though no problem with picking them up .,3
11738,Love it! Looks great without makeup. It gives the skin a healthy glowy look!,5
11739,I was a little disappoint with this hot brush because it's tip gets intirely too hot and the quality doesn't seem adequate.,3
11740,This flosser is easy to use and store.  It seems to do the job well and has a generous supply of tips.,4
11741,Your Average Boo Boo Liquor store Du-Rag! Uncomfortable!!!,1
11742,Work great for dry winter hands and feet. Love it,5
11743,"If I would use it , it would probably work.  It was delivered promptly.",5
11744,"It does a decent job for what I need it for, easy to clean, and the charge is good for four days.",4
11745,They are exactly like the price! Cheap quality! Wouldnt buy them again,1
11746,The soap is very nice. The lavender scent is awful. I keep hoping that the chemical smell will go away.,4
11747,Excellent product!  Received in good time.  Thank you!,5
11748,A lot of the tops of these cones were broken when I received the package so that was kind of disappointing,3
11749,"Ecvision Diffuser is very efficient, silent and easy to use..good for smaller rooms. They are small and compact blendng in well with any decor",4
11750,"I DID NOT GET 3000 gems OR NO WHERE NEAR, IM MADDDDDD ! I WAITED ALL THEM WEEKS FOR [THIS] ?????",1
11751,"This product was a suggestion from a friend and I'm so glad I tried it, it works great with no drying out effect.",5
11752,"Good for short hair.  Only 1/2""  brush iron I could find.",4
11753,"They ok don't look as bright as it should to me, the original bulbis smaller and brighter .",2
11754,Well... this is definitely NOT a miracle dark spot corrector.  Did it make them fade a little?  ....maybe?,2
11755,Good brushes. Arrived earlier than expected. some brushes were falling out but once i washed them they stopped. good brushes overall for the price.,4
11756,Consistency was a little thicker than I desired. But the product works just as well.,4
11757,Blade quality isn't consistent within the package. Some are as sharp as surgical instruments and others are like shaving with a broken beer bottle.,3
11758,It arrived on time and the product is as described.  It works very well.,4
11759,Fast and excellent product. Product quality and good price as I expected. Definitely  I would try other products. Thank you.,5

11761,"Way to strong of a smell for a baby, esp newborn. I sent it back.",2
11762,"Great buy and absolutely cannot tell the difference from BRAUN original brush heads!
Saves money and time searching!",5
11763,They were really difficult to get open the first time.,4
11764,Compact yet easy to handle. Strong floss won't break. Must have available at all times.,5
11765,The vacuum is a nice feature which keeps the hair from falling in the sink or on the floor. Trims pretty good also.,4
11766,Smells absolutely WONDERFUL!!!! Love this oil!,4
11767,I love this product. First time I tried it was from my sister. Just wish it came in a larger size bottle,4
11768,"Just sort of cheap...it didn't cost a lot, so I can be surprised, but it just isn't quite what I wanted.",2
11769,I really like these gloves however they are a bit rough so you have to be gentle when you scrub,4
11770,Goes on very smooth but it is too pale pink for my taste in color. but i like it for pastel outfits.,4
11771,"Very pretty, but a little smaller than I exspected...doesn't hold enough hair.",3
11772,It doesn't bring the whole screws.  I'm missing One of the screws so that's not good,1
11773,"They have been replaced by the HQ 56 , 55's not made any more",4

11782,"Posts were bent, but I was able to fix that on my own without having to return.",3
11783,I really like the feel of my skin after I use this product. It absorbs so quickly and my makeup goes on smoothly.,5
11784,I like this product however it starts to chip at the free edge and cuticle area. I would recommend this product.,4
11785,"easy to pump out liquid, I like that it is wide and it has a cap/cover that snaps in place securely.",5
11786,It's smaller than I thought and the bristles are ROUGH!  Ouch!,3

11792,Smells great. Love that castile soap is so versatile.,4
11793,Bottles are just a little larger than I was expecting in size -- good overall.  Great for homeopathic solutions.,4
11794,Very pretty. Will make a nice gift for a young girl.,4
11795,I have used this brush 2 monthes and 25 bristles have fallen off the iron.  Is this usual with this brush?,2

11801,"I was impressed by how it soften my hair.  Also, hair breakage has decreased significantly.",4
11802,It's great for a cheap concealer. It smudges off pretty easy but for the price it's really good. Color is as expected.,4
11803,Rated number 1 for a reason. Add to cart :),5
11804,I've used Oral-B toothbrushes for a very long time.  These work as expected and were very cost effective.  I would recommend these to anyone.,5
11805,Was't exactly what I was hoping for. Instruction manual is their ohhh but still couldn't get the gist. Maybe I will give it another try.,4
11806,This was a bit pinker than I was expecting.  I have had other cover girl products in this color that were a better match.,4
11807,Excellent blades for the price I paid. These will last me a long time before I have to order again.,5
11808,"While the received razor was acceptable, it was advertised as an 7310XL model, but a 7310 was shipped which is a cheaper model.",2
11809,$0.70 cents an ounce? I guess you can't do math if you use this product.,1
11810,Too expensive compared to the ones sold in stores.  Application is not easy.,3
11811,Died just after the return period ended. Didnt even last 2 months.,1
11812,Did not use because color came out a very ugly sludge color. Wrote company and received no reply.,1
11813,Blades last about a week to 10 days.  Great for the price.  One package will last me two years.,4
11814,Great primer. Doesn't really stop sweat but keeps makeup in place,3
11815,Not the smell I am looking for.  I prefer a lighter scent.,2
11816,I love this soap. No chemical smells here. Just nature.,5

11837,"Helped prevent stains, but did tend to slip a little.",4

11840,"These look very cute. The big ones look better, the other ones are too tiny",4
11841,For the price it was definitely a good purchase. Only bad thing is wish it was thicker.,4
11842,This is great for all DIY products. There is no smell at all and works great with EOs.,4
11843,Saved me- I couldn't find these at the hardware store.  Good quality.,5
11844,"I expected the new shaver head to shave better and closer than the old one, but it does not.",1
11845,The posts are too fat to fit in my ear.  Maybe someone with gauges cut swing them.,1
11846,"Item arrived 18 days earlier than the expected day of arrival, very reliable. Item is so pretty. Thank you.",4
11847,Used them a couple of times they cut into the corner of my eyes but work for there reason,2
11848,This scarf is Too small and will never be buying it. it is not going last. looks cheap t y,2
11849,The smell is very faint and you have to use more than recommended.  It does make very nice bubbles that last a long time though.,3

11861,Really great product.  I'm glad to find it again and at such a deal.,5

11864,I like it came very wrinkled still waiting for it to hang out,4

11866,I've had this powder before and I love the smell of it.,5

11869,"It's not as good as my adult one, but it works for now and helps my niece clean her teeth better.",4

11871,Great set for price. Brushes are hard to get out of the case but besides that I really like them. Case is not great!,4
11872,"I love the face wash from this line, but the lotions leave a yucky after-smell that does not smelly rosey, but more like rancid oil.",2

11894,"I have used it for a month now, and do not see any reason for buying this specific clean solution.",3

11899,So far this is the best oral gel that I have used so far and this really really truly works.,5
11900,Operation is fine except it louses up the TV if you use it when TV is on.  That should be cleaned up by adding a line filter.,4
11901,never buy  or order.... its a scam!!!!,1
11902,Leaves my hair in a waxy texture.. others shampoo bars leave it smooth and silky. Guess it depend on the hair texture,2

11904,not impressed at all.... i guess you get what you pay for...,2
11905,"Love the feel  of the lambskin. The fastner at the top of case does not clasp shut, always loose.",1

11907,For some reason it doesn't work as well as the gel bikini zone. From now on I'm ordering the gel.,2

11909,Went to a party i only applied once and it will not come off after eating or drinking.,5
11910,This was a 5 star review created in my name.  Someone is hacking my reviews.  I have never bought this.,1
11911,"This gloss had a horrible taste - very ""chemically"".  I had to throw it away.",1
11912,This continues to be a great deal for this product. The product itself works wonderfully and I think it is a better deal than using bar soup.,4
11913,Liked it well enough to buy a second one to keep  as spare.,4
11914,"Doesn't work as described, terrible quality! Pass N this purchase!",1
11915,Don't like the handle. Rather fat and hard to hold,3
11916,"Does not work well for a bunion, only keeps the two toes apart.",3
11917,This is a flimsy piece of equipment and a bad mustache trimmer...I had to shave my mustache off after using this thing and re-grow it.,1
11918,there are you tube videos online about how to use this and it's been so great for me so far,5
11919,A little smaller than expected with unhemmed edges but very pretty defiantly not quite what the pictures shows however,4
11920,"I've been using it for two weeks, I don't see any difference.",1
11921,It wasn't that much different than the Arbonne Lash Colour that I normally use.  I wouldn't pay the difference.,3
11922,"Smells great, and very inexpensive for a daily moisturizer.",5
11923,Amazing for the price!!! The perfect size studs!,4
11924,I have learned that interlockinh dreads is very bad for them. This tool was too flimsy as well.,2
11925,Stones were very uniform size. The basalt could have been darker,4
11926,This didn't shave very well and I ended up just throwing it away. Definitely not worth the money I spent for it,1
11927,Great for making headbands but the lace flowers on this nylon stuff is weird. And no instructions on how to remove,3
11928,Burned out motor in 8 months of use...Seems to be a problem with this brand,2
11929,"My wife and I decided to try waterpik as alternative to flossing. Seems to work well, and so far we have been using it daily.",4
11930,would be better to be able to choose color/design rather than random,4
11931,my man got them for me and they're cute and all but they don't stay on for more than a minute.,2
11932,"A little bigger then I expected, but it will due ?",4
11933,I love these earrings! I wear them all the time and am complemented on them often! There are enough pairs to share!,5
11934,I don't remember how long I have owned this shaver.  I bought another one for my dad as a gift.  Both of us love it.,5
11935,my case falling  part the brushes are faded out after the first wash of using them what hold the brushes is also falling part very unhappy,1
11936,"Terrible stuff!!
Did not cover at all!
Plus it got all over my bedspread!!",1
11937,"I was hoping this would keep my edges down for a couple house but it doesn't, it also leaves the area greasy .",2
11938,Love this! Goes on smooth and does not make your skin look dry.,5
11939,Not as good as the reviews say but still a decent comb. Blades definitely need to be longer.,3
11940,Very well made but doesn't seem to get that hot.,4
11941,"not the nag champa smell i know and love. the smell is not bad, but not what was expected",3
11942,"Doesn't last very long at all... However, the pens are beautiful",3
11943,"Very nice a little thinner than what I was hoping for, but she likes it.",4
11944,Wearing it right now as I type. I have really thick crochet braids in and this cap is still able to hold everything! I love it.,5
11945,Clay is great for your skin. Good brand and quality clay.,4
11946,"Case wouldn't fit iPod touch completely, and made from thin rubber so some what flimsy case...didn't like the case at all",1
11947,"Good, could be a little sharper. But does the job. Just have to be a little patient. Three more words required.",3
11948,I returned it as the plug was not compatible with British sockets or adaptors. Very disappointed.,1
11949,too many bells $ whistles . . . and less pressure than earlier models.  Not worth the price ov over $50,2
11950,"Too much price for this item, some alcohol will do same o even job",2
11951,My sister loves it! It was actually a little nicer than I expected.,4
11952,Not the original Super Hit. Cones don't burn right. Buy sticks better.,1
11953,LOVE IT. All guys with short hair need this. It has a dry look which I like.,5
11954,When I order it the show in pic different colors. But I just got all 4 is same black color don't like it,1
11955,LOVE this product! It makes me look like I have no pores! I wanted to give it a 4.5 but the stars wouldn't let me.,4
11956,Does not seem to be the same scent as others I've purchased from dept. stores for the past 25yrs. Watered Down?,2
11957,"Product works great, but price is very expensive.  We love the stuff, but not sure we'll get it again for the price.",4
11958,It came at a timely manner and now my razor is nice and clean,4
11959,This was a rip off. Overcharged and didn't cut..they also fall apart..i bought 10. None left,1
11960,This bracelet broke the first time that I wore it. It was cheap but I didn't expect it to break after a couple hours.,1
11961,"Surprised at the quietness of the razor, shaves smooth, quickly and easily even after two days growth.  The pop-up trimmer however rattles a bit noisily",4
11962,I like it details and compartments. However is smaller Thant I expected.,4
11963,"It was alright, it didn't help my redness or rosacea or anything, but it's just a basic moisture cream, eh.",3
11964,I haven't used the light bulbs.  They were ordered with the mirror as extra bulbs in case one burned out.,3
11965,"4 ratings because sometimes under extreme stress, it fails to stop me from biting my nails.. But overall am very satisfied.  Very nice product.",4
11966,I expected more from this. Didn't see any kind of change :(,3
11967,My family and I have been soaking in these magnesium flakes.  I have put some in a spray bottle with water and spray it on my skin.,4
11968,I didn't receive the one in the picture.  I receive a regular plastic blue thing like and apon.  There was no twisting involve.,1
11969,This is a good shaver only problem with it is that the trimmer sucks thats why i am giving this only 3 else 5 start,3
11970,Love this!! It's makes my skin feel like I had a left after a facial massage.,5
11971,Have used this for over a year now and it has always performed perfectly!  No quality problems whatsoever!  My dentist approves!,5
11972,i ordered it recently and very disappointed to see that all the sticks were extremely thick and unusable.,1
11973,"Don't see much results, container needs work, either won't pump or pumps too much",3
11974,burns when i use it but husband likes it so it'll be for him.,2
11975,These work the best of all the wax strips I've tried. They pull the most hair out and I don't feel as much pain.,5
11976,its my prefer spray but this time i don't know what's wrong is not the same product.i think is fake,1
11977,"Smaller than expected, I thought it was a regular size comb.",3
11978,"I like this product but it is lighter than my skin color..
Will buy again if there is a little darker than this..",4
11979,Should fill at the end with the string so the soap doesn't fall out,4
11980,Horrible razor. Pulls and you have to go over 10x's for it to be a reasonable shave.,1
11981,"Working well so far. I haven't been using it long, but it and the vitamin c serum are making my skin look brighter and healthier.",4

11993,Horrible product does not work.  Would like to return.,1

Took forever to arrive, I had no idea it was actually coming from Germany!,,",3
11997,"it is leaking only in 2 weeks of use and it was trashed in 3 months, what a disappointment and waste of money",1

11999,My husband says this is the best shampoo he's ever found -- and I love the scent.,5
12000,Stocking stuffer. Looks great for a preteen. Arrived well packed.,3
12001,Had an older Waterpik that lasted for a long time. This Waterpik will do the job again for sure:),4
12002,The color was not what I expected. it looked plumish on the picture...but is way more pinkish in real life.,3
12003,I like it for my lips and cracked skin on my face,4
12004,"Great blades for the money,they don't seem to nick me nearly as often as the Feather blades.",5
12005,Did not want to clasp into ear. Broke within days.,1
12006,"alright blade, first kind I purchased. After shaving for 6 months I know I prefer the feather style of blades for my skin type.",4
12007,Nice noticeable size. Edges of flower poke you. Not worth sending back though.,2
12008,I expected better results.  At least as good as dental floss. So far I am disappointed with the results. bnot as good as expected.,2
12009,"This shampoo is good, but I don't have any thing spectacular to say about it.
I prefer the Sage and Zinc shampoo by John Masters.",4
12010,"These refill intense reinforcing treatment , left my hair smooth and smell good! I like.",5
12011,Width to thick to go in your nose or ear!,1
12012,"It does what it supposed to but on mine, the  button that stops the waterflow sticks when it goes over 4.",3
12013,I did think this pillow was going to be all plastic but it does have a towel like texture on one side,3
12014,Horrible. Absolutely horrible. Follow that up with miserable customer service. I am appalled that Amazon allows this kind of **** here?!,1
12015,"Awful quality, very cheap. Spend your money on a quality product.",1
12016,"So far it's pretty good.  And so far, I would recommend it.  It's very convenient and a comfortable shave.",4

12026,"Battery does not seem to give enough power, doesn't feel strong, though it Feels like it gives a close shave",3

12028,"Bought the pair, used the powder, not the lotion yet.  Seems to help.",4
12029,I loved this bulb right up to the moment it flickered and died. Very disappointing since I'd only actively used it a week.,2

12034,"This stuff is amazing, it allows me to perform like a porn star. Won't have sex w/out it. I love it.",5
12035,"Looked around locally and could not find an exact match. Decided to purchase online. They fit, it works and I now have a spare blub.",4
12036,This was for my mother and so far she likes it....jr,4

12040,"this stuff is a waste of money, it just makes the situation worst..it caused more breakouts for me, so save your money.",1
12041,the product was watery and did not have a seal on it. i could not even use the product a waste,1
12042,Arrived on time and in good condition.  Good for practice cutting bobs and for foiling.  Purchased for graduated cut demo.  Will work just fine.,4
12043,Amazon shipped the wrong item. I had to contact amazon after I returned the item to get my refund. Overall satisfaction is poor.,1
12044,is an excellent opportunity price and product quality. rated 5 stars for that,5
12045,"This is a great product.  I really like how it makes your hair look smooth, not greasy.",3

12052,Didn't receive the right product didn't want to mess with returning it,1
12053,"Good product, saw result in neck area, not so much in hip/buttocks area. will continue to use.",4
12054,The brushes ware off after a while. Kind of regret buying it. It isn't great material but that's what you get with the price.,3

12064,Used it twice a day for several weeks and it did nothing for me unfortunately,3
12065,"Surprised at the small amount in container,  Product is good",4
12066,Didn't notice a difference in removing the chlorine smell. I have a very sensative nose. A regular lotion I think does the same thing.,2
12067,Say goodbye to expensive triple blades... this works even better.,4
12068,"Really lousy product...didnt cut at all, as if they've been used for a long time...",1
12069,but i did not like it but i will never get this again and see where i get it and how long it will take.,2

12072,No scent. If you bought this for the patchouli scent. Prepare to be disappointed,1
12073,Great. Soft. Foams good. First couple weeks had an odor. But that worked its way out. Handle is well made.,4

12078,It smell very bad . buying makeup online is a very bad idea. Never again.,2
12079,The color looked quite different on. It had a lot of blue in it.,3
12080,Keeps your locks in place. Removes easily with solvent.,5
12081,It doesn't absorb right away like when you put a sunscreen on your face.,3
12082,Disappointing. I'm an older woman maybe it works on the young,2
12083,Blades are great. Shipped fast too! However it was missing 2 out of the 3 screws and the 2 bushings it was supposed to come with.,3

12092,"Wen I went to put it on it was very stiff wore it for 2 days and then just fell apart , very dissatisfied",1
12093,The orange scent is much too strong. Goes on a little chalky.,2
12094,I love that it doesn't leave a heavy residue feeling on your face and it has a pleasant smell.,5
12095,I THOUGHT THEY WERE 3PACKS BUT ENDED UP BING 2 PACKS BUT STILL GOOD,4
12096,"Smells pretty bad. I have yet to decide if the reported anti fungal, antibiotic, or antiseptic properties are enough to make the smell worth it",3
12097,"I like it. Goes on smooth, stays, nice color easily blended.",4
12098,wish it had lasted longer... no matter how hard I tried to keep the bar dry between showers it was gone in a flash!,3

12103,Nice but the slots can be a bit bigger for curling irons,4
12104,Unfortunately the brush in the picture is not what I received. So very disappointed.,1
12105,a little dry and settles in lines - best to use over a lip primer and/or with a moisturizing lip balm,4
12106,I am not sure yet about how effective it is.,4
12107,Cheap plastic comb! You can finds better ones at Walmart. Not possible to return as well.,1
12108,"Shoots water like it is supposed to do... It's a bit louder than I prefer, but not horribly loud enough to require ear plugs...",4

12111,My hair still has yellow tinge but I am still using with hopes that it will brighten my hair,4
12112,I used to use this to remove make-up during my Theatre days. I am happy to see it is still available! Effective and great! Thanks!,5
12113,I ordered my second pad and so far I have been pleased with the results.  It is a good temporary fix.,4
12114,Lighter in color than expected. But gives a natural look when no makeup is worn. It's very moisturizing for an amazing price.,4
12115,It was okay. Not sure If I will purchase again.,3
12116,"It's way to watery, doesn't blend well.",2
12117,Seems to do the job but greatly overpriced; would not buy again.,3
12118,it was not a long. It looks like my grandmas head scarf,2
12119,Great product for seniors and people with limited mobility.  Nice and light and gentle.,5
12120,This was not the same quality as the first pad I received and will not last as long....,2
12121,The product is perfect. I bought two of this kind of products for my father and my husband. They all liked the product very much.,4
12122,Seems to do its job well.  like the adjustment for power.  Have not used all the attachments that came with it.,4
12123,"Why is it so small, the size is not worth the money.",2
12124,Arrived early--very well made and nicely packaged--length perfect to keep mesh rollers in place.,5
12125,I love them!  They give me 10 years back.,5
12126,"zum bar soap- the best there is- I especially love the scent of this one of my all time favorites, always makes me think of baby Jesus.",5

12128,"Still don't get the high marks given for this mask, but wanted to try the small size first.",3
12129,The product we received was an empty box with a note attached.,1
12130,alittle smaller than I thought - but still they are good,3
12131,Love finipil. It really does prevent ingrown hair. I prefer the LAIT 100. I wish amazon would sell. Great price.,5
12132,"Not so hot. All my old ones cut better and closer.
Threw it in the bottom drawer where it will languish until I give it away.",1
12133,Extends lashes but makes my eyes look like a raccoon within a few hours.,3
12134,I love that I can camoflage my roots between touch-ups. The only negative is that the product isn't shiny.,5
12135,Sent a white pair instead of mint color shown. Glove works fine but would have not purchased white.,2
12136,"They're different from the pictures, didn't matter though they get the job done.",4
12137,I think it's great except that the nozzle falls off ALL the time.,3
12138,Fit existing razor fine. No issues with sharp edges or scratching. I would recommend this product for anyone that already has this razor.,5
12139,Upon opening this item the strong odor of mildew was so disgusting that I returned it.,1
12140,The bottom of this fell out after a few uses.,1
12141,Sturdy and my razor and brush do not move once I set them on it.. mostly due to gravity.. but yes.. it works.,4
12142,I could not use them because very difficult to open. Too lazy to send them back so I just tossed them.,1
12143,"bought it long time ago as gift for my father, he is happy for what he got it, no issue at all for about 2 years.",4
12144,Although these are not produced by the micro pedi manufacturer they work great.  Less than half the cost .arrived on time and in good condition.,4

12154,"Surprised how well it works , removing particles of food between my teeth!  I would recommend this product to anyone as a supplement to brushing",4
12155,"You can't beat the deal for this series. It combines the right amount of action, interesting characters and tongue-and-cheek writing.",5
12156,"The cost was too hard to pass up, had to get it!
It's so hard to find these items at an affordable price.",4
12157,Does the job. Seems like sturdier construction that previous unit.,4
12158,"Waste  of money. I have very fine, thin hair  and I still had a hard time getting this brush through it when it was wet.",1
12159,"Very relaxing. I found that it gave me pimples though, almost immediately after massaging my face.",2
12160,"Still testing, but I believe it has taken about 1 1/2 inches off of my wings.",5

12162,I  like it very much for my shaving evrry day.,4
12163,This is a good manual toothbrush. Good grip. My toddler likes it but I find it hard to maneuver the head around in her small mouth.,3
12164,Advertised to be compatible with the Turbo Power 3200 but did not fit.  The hair dryer on the other hand is fabulous!,1
12165,"My son used it and a couple of the tabs broke off.
Had to buy a new one or just trim my beard short.",1
12166,"Yes, all OZ Naturals are excellent.  The serum is REALLY good.  Will buy more",5

12176,"I've had this about a month, generally those do not last long, but so far so good, will see how long it lasts for.",4
12177,"It covered up flaws okay, but it was waay too dark for my skin. ""fair"" concealer shouldn't be dark and orange tinted.",3
12178,Doesn't cut very well. Not a close shave at all. The holder is huge and glows a blue light.  Not getting another one.,2
12179,"Replaced another shaving stand that didn't fit my brush. This stand is heavy, nicely made and looks super classy.",5
12180,Way too tight on head. And when you take it off your head it messes up the sides of your head . Defeats the purpose,1
12181,"Absolutely love this set! The brushes are soft and hold well, well made.",5
12182,"Its rubbing alcohol in a very small bottle,waste of money",1
12183,This is ok.  I had a diff. one by another company which was way better but can't seem to find it on the internet.,3
12184,"OK, used them for my invalid Mother in law. Keeps her legs warm.",3
12185,This cleans the shaver well but has a pungent odor. I wish it had the original odor that first came with the shaver.,4
12186,It doesn't do quite as good a job as I'd hoped.......but it's better than nothing!,3
12187,"The razor works well and gives me a nice clean shave, and is an improvement over anything else I've used.",5
12188,couldn't keep them for long time got old within a month. idk maybe i just store it right.,3
12189,The tabs to hold the tablet keep slipping off. They let the tablet slip around rather than hold it tight.,2
12190,Really good. gives you good amount of foam and smells awesome.,5
12191,it holds up yes. but its hard to get right when u have DD...so just don't waist the little money they cost.,2
12192,One finger came apart after 2 uses.  Good for folks with long fingers.,3
12193,I love it.....It comes as expected and it lasts all day long ...will most definitely purchase again...thank you,5
12194,"GREAT PRODUCT, BUT THERE WASN'T MUCH LOTION IN THE BOTTLE?",2

12196,"IT DOES LAST LONG FOR ME LAUGH OUI LOUD, NUY OTHER THAN  THAT IYS OKAY. THANKS FOR THE PRODUCT THANKS",3

12199,Not as close a shave as with the more expensive Gillette 5-blade product.,3
12200,color didn't turn out as expected and faded faster then other splat,2
12201,Truly lasts at least 18 hours!  Only have to apply it once in the morning.  This thing is a miracle.,5
12202,received the waterpik and it works great at a very reasonable price. The price was 50.44 with free shipping.,4
12203,"I like the weight and built, looks brilliant.

However it doesn't hold my Mach 3 Razor, it just rotates and falls off.",2
12204,"this junk does not rate a capitol letter!
Not worth your time. money or review.
Save your money & buy a good one.",1
12205,this is my fourth norelco and it does not compare with the othrs I have owned. I am surprised at the cheapness of this company,3
12206,I don't think this really works.. I don't notice my polish drying any faster when I use it.,2
12207,Works well. I don't sweat off my makeup.,4
12208,Flaw: there was a split in the body of the glove near he cuff,1
12209,tHE PADS WERE THINNER THAN THEY WERE WHEN I BOUGH PREVIOUSLY.  THEY DID NOT SUIT MY PURPOSE WELL.  I WILL NOT BUY AGAIN.,2

12214,Not very good quality but hey they were cheap so you get what you pay for!,1
12215,I have not used all the oils so far but the two we used are good and my wife loves them.,4
12216,This soap has a great lather and moisturizes nicely but the smell is disappointingly faint and not at all like sandalwood.,3
12217,This works pretty well for me. I have been using for a few weeks and I can already see the improvement.,4
12218,poor quality - also I've seen it at Rite Aide for HALF the price I paid here - serves me right!,1
12219,I've started stealing my daughters conditioner this stuff works so well,5
12220,"The shaving attachment is not very good,but the others work fine.  This is not great for trimming hair, but works well for beards.",4
12221,As described and arrived quickly. Good price for a 3 pack,5
12222,its like putting ben gay in your mouth. so if you like that then youll like this,3
12223,"like this product ,hairdresser introduced me to it , and it is great for people with the short hair styles",4
12224,"Don't waste your time or your money, just go to your doctor.",1
12225,I was kind of dissapointed that they gave me all silver but it freaked my mom out which i wanted!,4
12226,Will not keep full of air. The top suction cups won't stick. Rated C-,1
12227,It is ok. Not so strong. I used Jamaican versions that are stronger.,3
12228,dont think its worth the price. feels liek normal cotton socks for 7.99,3
12229,Love this bag. I just wish the pocket on the strap was big enough to fit the larger smart phones.,4
12230,"Not sure but I got rashes, breakout and hives - maybe it does not too well on ethnic or sensitive skin",1
12231,"Looks awesome, but a bit small and unimpressive unless seen close up.  Also one broke first week.",3
12232,I really like these blades. I shave every morning and change them once a week.,4
12233,"Even used at the lowest power level, it made my gums bleed. It also was very messy.",2
12234,"Very strong fragrance. If you are sensitive to cologne, don't buy it. Otherwise, makes the skin soft after shave.",2
12235,One of the pumps' came with plastic that looked like it had melted and then dried. It was unusable. And they weren't foaming pumps!,1
12236,My Remington shaver performs at least as well as the Panasonic shaver I was using and without the need for the wet shaving cream.,4
12237,Nice. Make sure you shake the bottle before using or it comes out runny.,4
12238,"Does not seem to do much ""miracle"" on my hair. I don't think I'll buy this again.",3
12239,Good but hard to use with anything but the thinnest socks.,4
12240,this stuff works great. smells good and keeps my skin moisturized all day. I need to get a bigger jar for sure.,5
12241,I got the item today opened it tried using it and it broke this thing is over priced and very cheap I'm very disappointed in this product,1
12242,Takes a couple times to get used to. Sprayed my mirror a couple times,3
12243,I gave it 3 stars because it gotten a little fuzzy but apart from that i really like it.,3
12244,"The brush is difficult  to hold, because it has a short handle.  Also, it doesn't get through the tough tangles of curly hair.",2
12245,"I like the slanted tip, great for cuticles but it's not as sharp as I wish it were.",3
12246,Great sent and good lather but does not last very long,4
12247,A huge disappointment in this as well.  I just don't know why it never does what they say it will do,2
12248,One of the better body washes that I have found.  Gets you really clean and doesn't leave a smell on you.  Great product!,4
12249,"Fast shipping, easy payment, good product. Just not exactly what I was looking for. The brushes are nice just not the quality I wanted.",4
12250,Pretty cool but a lot of work. The polish peels off after a week.,3
12251,Doesn't work on reducing or preventing pimples/acne breakouts for me.,2
12252,These are terrible. It broke before I could even get it in my hair.  They are thin and cheaply made. Don't waste your time.,1
12253,Thought this would be a good color for me but turned out to be too dark for my liking. It's meh....,3
12254,Works weel with my Norelco razor and reminds me I need to order some more.,4

12267,We are very happy with our Waterpik ultra water flosser.,5

12269,Leave patchy film around your mouth. Barely comes off w oil,1

12271,I just love it! M I have an oily t zone and with this my face doesn't get greasy!,5
12272,These work great and the price was reasonable. They have a new one out now that grips better with the same results but way more $$$,4
12273,"These were small about 22 gauge, but worked for me.  Nice color varieties  and I haven't had a issue with any gems falling off.",5
12274,Oh If they would just do something about the smell. Good oil but come on people!,3
12275,"this is item is ok for the price, but it is too harsh on skin, it gets uncharged sudenly, and it takes to long to recharge",3
12276,Not as matte as I had hoped but still ok and it lasts without adding any other top coat to it!,3
12277,Was expecting to have all 5 sponges in stead of just the one. Good quality. Nice price.,4
12278,"This glue ""cakes"" up and does not stick properly!",1
12279,I love the staying power of this lipstick! I just wish it came in a wider variety of colors.,4
12280,Convenience factor is great. But the brush hurt my face. The bristles are plastic,2
12281,No instructions but was fairly easy to mount on my vanity. Very sturdy and a serious space-saver,4
12282,Look like the ones I get from my home health supplier but these smell funny. I use but not happy with the smell.,3
12283,"I have not used an electric razor for some years, so it is taking some time for adjustment. However, it is working quit well.",4

12287,Great for the price!!! I am a professional makeup artist and this is great for free gifts to clients or beginners.,4
12288,Daughter simply loved it with all of its dazzling sparkles and intricate wiring hidden on the backside.,5
12289,As described and here fast. Great product. Thanks!,5
12290,"It's too large,Don't tight at all. I am very disappointed",1
12291,"FYI, burns your gums a bit. Thought it was the same product I bought before but didn't have that problem before.",3
12292,item came in really quick.  a little learning curve when attempting to release hair but once you get used to it it works.,4
12293,It was not at all was I was expecting.  I would say it is travel size.,1
12294,"Affordable blades. Every once in a while you get some that are dull or defective, but overall it's still much more affordable than anything else.",4
12295,For the price I give 3 stars. But it does look cheaply made close up. But from a distance is still cute.,3
12296,Too heavy for my hair. Can only use if I do an up do,3
12297,The motor is already burned out . Need a refund. I was extremely dissatisfied. Will never by this brand again if I can help.,1
12298,Just took longer to get to me then I wanted.,3
12299,"It been 3 weeks now i started using the cream.not done all the magic it
Promised yet. But i still believe i can get some results later.",3
12300,I like it but a little messy. Perfect for face but not bikini. Comes with creams also. Great product. Lana,4
12301,Falls out nose so quick I have lost 2 already and it's been a week,3
12302,It's an ok toner. But it didn't really transform my skin. And I even feel it is a bit pricey for what it does.,3
12303,Definitely a lot smaller than i expected. Waste of money..,1
12304,Does everything it said it would do. My only gripe is that I can never get all the different piks to fit into the case.,5
12305,Really good product. Gets the job done as expected at a good price. Couldn't ask for more than is expected.,5
12306,"Not easy to put in my hair,,  But I have gotten a lot of compliments!",3
12307,I's expecting the bottle to be made of glass(as it was some 50 years ago) this is why not 5 stars!,4
12308,"So far so good. Easy, small, doesn't pull hairs and doesn't require going over the same spot multiple times. Satisfied.",4
12309,Has a very nice smell  just wish it would last longer.  Good for about 10 min and then gone. Nice for getting out wrinkles in linen,4
12310,"Work well, but there is no indicator to indicate the level of charge.",3
12311,"it's intense, much bolder than I need or wanted!",3
12312,"Very nice, looks great by my foot bridge. Connecting wire is just a bit too short, another 3-4 inches would work",4
12313,Terrible product.  Not only does it not provide shine it actually dries your hair! Don't waste your money!!,1
12314,Good deal if you are like me and don't see any reason to buy a new electric razor every year or two.,5
12315,Bought several of these smaller jars - affordable and love the silky feel of my skin in the morning! Great with the DayWear Advanced Protection by E.L..,5
12316,used these on vacation - cannot use sunscreen near my eyes as it's very annoying.  These little babies do the trick.,4
12317,"I bought it for my family and they loved it. However, some of the tips were useless to me.",4
12318,"Works well, good product, rather efficent, egonomic, low maintence, easy to clean except on off button broke off with use.",4
12319,Smells so Good!  Great moisturizer. I still wish they've kept the old Quench lotion though.. Smell might be too much for some people though.,5
12320,Fell right off. I guess it was a cheap fix first symptom as opposed to actually fixing the problem,1
12321,It looks pretty good but the color isn't what I was expecting,4
12322,The product is very good but the way of shipping is bad the top of oil bottle is broken .,4
12323,It just as picture but it smells like kerosene and it is stiff. but it will look great on me,4
12324,This product works every bit as good as the Beverly hills MD product at half the price.,4
12325,This stuff is super strong cinnamon flavor and I live it!,5
12326,"I see a difference in the density of my eyelashes, but no difference on my scalp. I will be buying a second bottle.",4
12327,"It is very very wide.  I like it for some teeth, but must use skinnier floss for others.",4
12328,They are ok for the most part.  Sometimes you open them up and they are flawed or not made right or don't fit at all,3
12329,Works great for my swimmer! He was always complaining of dry itchy skin during swim season. Now he just uses this lotion and he loves it.,5
12330,"I use the Balla Powder everyday after a shower and feel fresh all day, much better then regular baby powder.",5
12331,Beautiful bottle.  Nice fragrance.  Lilac purple color is spot on.,5
12332,I like it. I though not 100% safe trimming but much better than other ones that I have tried.,4
12333,Tangles hair easily as the release function does not always work.,2
12334,"The cape is fun looking for a kid, but as other posted there is a gap behind even around a preschooler's neck.",4
12335,The product is good took a while to get it but worth the wait,4
12336,This product has a funny smell and consistency.  I don't think it works.  Save your money and find a product that actually works.,1
12337,They aren't an exact replacement. The original product seemed to create better suction.,2
12338,Was opened and was not was is shown in the picture. Totally different brand,1
12339,Love the way this smells and makes my hair very manageable. I have purchased this 3 times already.,5
12340,it is so sticky the roller ball won't work well.  The adhesive stays wet and makes it a sticky mess.,1
12341,"Must have been bought as 'seconds'...clumped up, dry in tube.",2
12342,"Only getting one star because it arrived on time
They were SAMPLES
Not travel sizes
SAMPLES
I PAID $24 for samples ",1
12343,The best shampoo at half the price charged by salons.,5
12344,"Great gel, it is organic and smell so good, natural!!!",5
12345,Looks nice on the vanity as opposed to the cheaper items I had used in the past.,4
12346,"Smells amazing for the price, but a little too alcoholic.",4
12347,works well for getting food from your teeth. I find it gets you wet while you are using it so wear short sleeves while using it.,4
12348,This is a great product! only thing is it is kinda loud. other than that I'm satisfied :),1
12349,"Gift for daughter, who uses this brand and same item.  She's very pleased.",5
12350,Works but cuts up sensitive skin after only 3 uses. Seem like it will dull quickly :(,2
12351,For the price-a great product! Shipped out fast as well. (:,4
12352,"Lovely product and works great, except the artificial coloring :(",5
12353,I bought these because the description said buffer blocks. These are more like sanding blocks!!! Never buying again!,1
12354,"It was working for a while but after using another bottle, it wasn't really as effective as it was the first time.",2
12355,I've been using it for years. It work s great,5
12356,Have been using Miracle Skin Transformer for some years now and would no be wthout it.,4
12357,I really like it. Doesnt look fake and the color is the exact one as the photo.,5
12358,These are sharp!! Awesome stuff first use 0 nicks,4
12359,"Product is great for knocking out little particles, but is not a substitute for flossing. Waterpik is a more informative name than Water Flosser.",4
12360,"It's a good product and it has a very good power saver and features are also good, easy to clean.",4
12361,Nice fragrance and soaks in right away so my fingers aren't super oily.  Its the perfect consistency and I use it daily.,4
12362,There was a lense missing. Cannot use them.,1
12363,"Gentle cream clenser, has left my skin soft and glowing and I don't break out at all.  Love it.",5
12364,I would not buy this product again.  Didn't help with the rash.  It's just glorified hair conditioner...not worth the money.,2
12365,The tape was to thick and not flexible to the skin.,2
12366,This was super cheap generic attempt at a hairagmi next time I'll pay the extra shipping -!: get the one I wanted,1
12367,"exactly what you expect, they work just the way they should.  would order again, anytime i need new ones.",4
12368,Product was exactly what I expected. Wife loves it!,5
12369,"Really strong Smell, it literally fell apart when I opened, going to try for a week to see a difference in my Stretch marks.",2
12370,Arrived broken. Going to try to glue them together seeing as I need them for tanning ASAP.,1
12371,Worked great for the first few weeks now it's not pumping.,3
12372,Got this for my daughter. Nice. Received it quickly.,3
12373,Peeling the dead skin...nice product...will buy again,4
12374,Arrived in a timely manner.  Nicely packed and cheaper than from the outlet store from Braun,4
12375,Well in the picture to me it looks different then when i received it.  For me it is a little too small.,3
12376,Does not lather well and have not noticed a difference in my hair,3
12377,"Bought it for my 90 year old mother, she had me buy another for my sister too. Second one bought arrived in less than 48 hours.",5
12378,"Not sharp enough. Thus, the shave don't last whole day",1
12379,"Wasnt expecting a Vaseline type product, but thats what this is.",4
12380,"photo in ad. is of 1180xx not the 1250x I expected one in picture, when I open box that caused confussion on my part",3
12381,I don't like the smell.  It's way too perfumy so I can't even use it.,1
12382,This enabler does not fit overe the newer car keys with jacketes on them.  It also does not fit normal enry keys to my house.,1
12383,I didn't find it sharper compared to Merkur blades. Returning the 5 pack.  Quality of steel is good tough.,2
12384,Does a poor job of cleaning . The Flosser requires a great deal of effort to obtain minimal results of cleanliness.,2
12385,I am very pleased with this belly button ring. It took about 2 1/2 weeks for it to arrived. I highly recommend it.,5
12386,"4 pills per day is difficult.. shedding slowed a bit. hair not growing  yet.. 2 month

the price has gone down.",3
12387,This leave my hair with too much residue. I have tried better shampoos for less.,3
12388,If help my sister son skin dry go away keep his skin smooth,5
12389,Works well no bad smell wish it got me a bit darker,4
12390,The product is good. My teeth are more white. The unique problem is that each tray is too small and these only cover my front teeth.,4
12391,"Used one time and it broke, don't waste your money!",1
12392,I expected this to be smaller. I replaced it with something I could take on an International trip with limited space.,3
12393,Ok for NEW MAKE UP LEARNING APPLICATION. THEN MOVE UP TO HIGHER BRAND...,3
12394,If stars are not enough; please stop asking for my review. I could just as easily not do any of it and just delete your emails.,4
12395,Love this so much that I put in a blender and mix with other products.  The smell is wonderful,5
12396,My bags are way better but I would try another eye patch not the best product.,3
12397,Disappointed that they contain Sucralose which is an artificial sweetener.  Blah!,1
12398,This works! I not only bought it for myself but friends that now swear by it!,5
12399,I love the bracelet but the bracelet is stiff. It does not go around my wrist easily. I love the design of it though!,4
12400,"These say Toni & Guy on them, and they are definitely not. Returned",1
12401,The best floss in the market. Great price at Amazon,5
12402,Kinda cheap and i got an ugly color not gonna be getting anymore. These are for toddlers,1
12403,"Its kind of a waste of money, you might as well buy the regular size as you cannot re-do them too many times with this kit",2
12404,Great item. Shipped fast. Packaged nicely. Thanks!,5
12405,A little tight.... other than that it's fine,3
12406,Love this lotion!  Works great and smells good without smelling scented which I hate.,5
12407,"it gives a close shave,battery charge last a long time,the only bad thing it is very loud over all OK",3
12408,These brushes are simple. However it's great for the price!,4
12409,Not what expected.  I did order wrong size and need to exchange.  The strong rubber burning odor was somewhat disturbing.  Hopefully they would allow exchanges.,3
12410,I expected to be able to remove the entire brush but only the bristles come off. A core stays attached.,3
12411,"I like the pattern i got, and the fabric is nice. The wire inside doesn't feel to sturdy though.",3
12412,"I always use this product. However, the ones that were sent the lotion did not have a consistency.",2
12413,"It was short a few nose rings, all reviews are very inconsistent. Price is decent, but damn guys.",2
12414,"Extremely hard to open container, but the product is great.",3
12415,"This brush is small and easy to hold, performs as it should, would recommend it to anyone needing a small brush.",5
12416,Loved it and would love to but some more but just to expensive..,5
12417,I couldn't be more pleased.  They even came a day early. AWESOME,5
12418,"perfect, the only big round brush i could find that works with very long hair. Thank you",5
12419,These do not work at all. They still leave a crease and they don't hold your hair up verry well.,1
12420,"My ""GO TO"" DE blade. Yes, there are others that are sharper but for the price the Astra SP is hard to beat.",4
12421,Used this for quite a while before I pinpointed it as the source of my breakouts.,1
12422,Product did the job as advertised. Helped to extend the lifespan of my razor just a little longer than I expected.,4
12423,I could not do nail art without this stuff. It gives you so much control over your polishes and makes them last forever!,5
12424,Absolutely love this product. I noticed a difference after only 2 uses. Not only does it remove blackheads it leaves your skin feeling soft and moist.,5
12425,Love the smell and price.  But it left a wax feel.  I gave it away.,3
12426,This is ok.  I had a diff. one by another company which was way better but can't seem to find it on the internet.,3
12427,These are great to help with fresh breath all day.,5
12428,"It is nice but the color is so light, it doesn't look very natural on me.",4
12429,"Good brush, nice firm bristles, but overall just too short.",3
12430,The best for healing minor scrapes and irritations better than anything I have used...  Also works great on chapped lips.....,5
12431,Would not recommend this have a strong smell and it does not stay the way they describe it,1
12432,I really like it. Just wish it will stay shiny longer,4
12433,"Razor works well; no issues after over a year of use.  Much quieter than the Braun it replaced, and no silly cleaning solution to buy.",4
12434,I really enjoy this product! Will buy again. Love that it is not heavy or thick.,5
12435,I only got to wear each one for maybe 2 days and then the stud fell out.,2
12436,Poor quality!!!!!!!!! The one i got was leaked and only half of the liquid left.,2
12437,Didnt like the toilet chain. It should be longer or the pendant should be strung on leather. I think it was a little expensive also.,3
12438,This gave a terrible vaginal infection. Cost me distress and doctor fee to heal.,1
12439,The blades are fine but are not secure and tend to fall out if the razor is upside down.,3
12440,This hair is so  beautiful I  love it I can't wait to get  my hair!,5
12441,Does the basic job-nothing fancy. Rather difficult to clean though . Would purchase again for the basic functionality.,4
12442,A years worth of blades for half the price of a pack of four Mach 4 blades.  What's not to like.,5
12443,"I purchased this diffuser, it stopped working after only two weeks. I cleaned it just as directed and used distilled water but it will not work.",1
12444,Nice white color and the pastilles melt easily. No smell. Would buy again.,4
12445,did not work for the dude in our house like it did for the dude who posted his review; we are still assessing how it works for whom,3
12446,FOUND THIS SAME PRODUCT AT TARGET FOR $6.22 FOR 2 BOTTLES!,1
12447,I love this lipstick i love darker lipsticks so it was perfect it also looks really beautiful on dark skin.,4
12448,I bought this a couple of years ago and I think I got 3 uses out of it. Would have been better off buying disposable razors.,1
12449,I love the scent of the music. Unfortunately they don't make this anymore but it's the best,5
12450,"It's small, functional and purple - what's not to love!",4
12451,"it is the same model I bought before, but not as strong as the previous one and and smoth more.",4
12452,"A waste of money!!
It washes only 3 times",1
12453,I've bought Jason products for years. Amazon is a good place to get them at a good price.,5
12454,"Pricing was a rip off, but I can't find this in regular stores anymore.  Guess I'll be going without once I run out.",2
12455,Love this product!  Been using it for years.  Does the trick after eating garlic or other spicy/smelly food.,5
12456,Very disappointed with this product.  It worked 3 times only since receiving it on November 7th.,1
12457,"This shampoo bar was just ok. Left my hair kind of tacky, but had a nice clean smell.",3
12458,Sorry I won't even give it one star.but its required to rate so I will rate one star..they all turned black in 2 days of wearing them,1
12459,they were exactly wat i expected wish they came earlier but loved them,4
12460,"It does it's job pretty well, but chips very easily. I'd go with a classic glass one if I were you!!!",4
12461,I received the wrong lipstick color. Do better smh.,1
12462,Nice but if you apply lip balm or any kind of oily lip product on top it will start to disintegrate and peel off.,4
12463,My teeth feel clean after using.  I don't have room on my counter otherwise I would use it more.  Was delivered in the time promised.,4
12464,"Excellent product.  Needs to have a low battery indicator
Works fine.  Good shave.",4
12465,I love this for my blonde hair. It really does make it shine,5
12466,I prefer the cleaning performance of dental tape over floss.  This works well.,4
12467,Waterpik has always been a high quality and very reliable product for me.  I received the Waterpik in a timely manner and as advertised condition.,5
12468,Works but it's built very lightly indeed. the hose coils but is difficult to coil correctly so the wand can be clipped back on the unit.,3
12469,Very disappointed with this product.  It worked 3 times only since receiving it on November 7th.,1
12470,Our 11yr old uses this for cleaning and it works very well.  Takes a bit of practice...but well worth it!,4
12471,Did nothing for me. Boring dull fragrance. Would not buy again.,1
12472,Thicker than the usual thin floss does a much better job at cleaning plaque. Also does not rip or shred. And no minty flavor .,5
12473,I do not see any change at all under my eyes! Waste of money!,1
12474,worth the price....i am ticked that an opinion needs this much trouble  this is the last rating I`ll make. shove it,4
12475,I used it for 2 months: it got rid of my freckles and reduced my pores but gave me more wrinkles!! Not worth it!!,1
12476,Did not work for my feet... but worked for my girlfriend.,3
12477,Water shoots everywhere and makes a mess. Not satisfied with this product. Thank you very much! Writing all of these words is ridiculous.,2
12478,The cutter works fine but the foil does not fit my series 1 190. Entirely different,2
12479,I love the way it works. Perfect size and cleans very nicely. I am very pleased with the toothbrush .,5
12480,Product has surpassed my expectations. I will continue using it. I would recommend to people that they try it. Bye,4
12481,This was a gift for my daughter. But she loves this brand.,4
12482,I only received on pair of toe separator unlike the two pair promised in the advertisement.,1
12483,"The handle is good, but nothing special.  But the razor blades are by far the best I have aver oned",4
12484,item is very handy for on the go...so far so good...i am pleased and i use it often....yep yep yep,4
12485,I purchased 5 sets of these for $6.09 and only received four of them.; (,2
12486,I'm not even sure where this item is.  I used it a few times and immediately comes off.  Not very matte either.,2
12487,Love... Only problem is if it's very hot and humid outside they don't stay stuck. I use medical clear tape then.,4
12488,"I suppose you get what you pay for. These are inexpensive pretty earrings. After 3 wearings, the center faux pearl fell out.",2
12489,Works VERY well for holding my shaving brush.  Cleans up easily.  Quality built and looks great.,5
12490,It's turning my stomach green but other than that it's very pretty. You could probably paint over it with clear nail polish,3
12491,"it arrived broken.  If I would have read the other reviews, I would not have purchased it.",1
12492,Good product... there are better creams for kids or adults with severe dry skin.,2
12493,"Worked like it was supposed to, everything is good the needle is sharp and it is done.",4
12494,The brushes are pretty . But you get what you pay for !,3
12495,"Helped me be less shiny. Lol.
Also. I used this without concealer worked good.",4
12496,Haven't used them all yet but so far so good.,4
12497,loved it so much i got this one for my son,5
12498,Product contains things that I found out are not healthy so I will not use this product again.,1
12499,"Might be all mental, but peace of mind is great to have for wanting something clean that goes in your mouth.",4
12500,There is not enough in this item to last more than a few applications. It is more of a sample. Great little kit though.,4
12501,So far I'm enjoying the Pic.  I feel my teeth are much cleaner now.,4
12502,A waste of money .... I would give it zero stars but there no rating for that,1
12503,Every brush fell apart the first week. For but these.  The tips fall off and the little ones do nothing but did over,1
12504,All the Provence Sante products are great.  This is my favorite of all the fragrances.  My husband loves this one too!,5
12505,I would give this a five but you have to use 1/2 cup for a decent amount of bubbles.,4
12506,"Doesn't smell like Carnations at all, it smells bad when first placed and then 2 hours later you smell nothing. Will not purchase again.",2
12507,The bristles on the brushes started calling out after 1 use,1
12508,Great packaging and great product! Would buy again for sure :),4
12509,Quick delivery and in good order.  The reservoir is smaller than I would like but it performs well.,4
12510,We have been using this on my daughter since she was born. We love it. Leaves her clean and has a nice scent.,5
12511,This is my second Bucky sleep mask. The first one lasted about 8 years before the elastic band was shot.,5
12512,Some of these dried out my skin too much and irritated my eyes.,3
12513,"Not like the picture at all!!! All my leather was brown, and not the same metal is pictured.
Very disappointed!",1
12514,"feels good on my face but I can't tell if my dark spot is going away. Honestly, I think it takes a while.",3
12515,"I like this product, but wish it also came in a 1/2"" size.  My hair is short so I could really use that size.",4
12516,"Good times, good game, excellent price. From rotating barrel long rifles to getting Ms. Snuggle Butt's budonka-donk this is fun throughout.",5
12517,I actually really enjoy this lipstick & it smells like coco butter ,4
12518,"Love it, a little messy at first. I left the dentist earlier and she felt that I was doing better with my floosing.",4
12519,Was told by my Dentist to get one I did and like the way my teeth and cleaned of Plaque,4
12520,"This is a great concealer.  It does ware off through the day, so additional applications are required.",4
12521,"The rings are so big you have to gage high. Not earring size, and they don't care.",1
12522,This is one of the most beautiful lotions I have ever used. Compliments on a daily basis! It is so soft and smooth. Love it!,5
12523,"Well, I like how it tastes but can't speak for its whitening ability at the moment.  It has a nice clean feeling to it.",5
12524,Really love this product and it works. Will be buying more soon.,4
12525,"They don't taste as the fruit they have in the label, it's pure oil taste",2
12526,Skin did not improve. Felt like using scented water.,1
12527,Cheap and does what it says!  That's all i want from the product I buy.,5
12528,Nice smell..lots of lather but didn't last too long for the cost,3
12529,"Fails SUPER fast! NO, NO, NO!!!",1
12530,"Although pharamon perfume such as this is kind of a joke, this stuff smells fantastic and I would buy it just for this reason.",4
12531,Bought it for my sister for her birthday she loved it,1
12532,"I bought two of these, they both died after one month. Very disappointing.",1
12533,really like these nail buffers.  Great price.  They seem to work much better than others I have tried.  Would recommend.,5
12534,This ointments has helped heal my cracked skin within 3 days of use.,5
12535,Have been using for a few months and I have noticed no difference.  Has not worked for me.,1
12536,I love the color.  Does not last long on lips.  Have to apply too frequently.,4
12537,"It's amazing how much food gets slodged between your teeth. Even after brushing and flossing, the Waterpik stil dislodged some chunks of food. Incredible.",5
12538,Smells like nail polish. Most of the items on arrival are covered with an additional liquid monomer brush and half broken bottle.,1
12539,Wasn't to happy its to flimsy it would be great made of thin medal,1
12540,the tangle free  hot air brush does not work well to untangle hair from the brush .,2
12541,I love pink & I love these brushes. They give a even coverage & blend. Great price point.,3
12542,they look great with certain outfits. the finishing touch.,4
12543,"They don't really grab the make up, I should have gotten a better quality.",2
12544,Mine has no fragrance. Does this mean it is old? I was looking forward to the lovely fragrance I read about.,2
12545,Did not see any changes in skin appearance nor in fine line or wrinkle disappearance.  I used it as the directions instructed.,1
12546,"I bought this for my wife. Whenever she turns it on, this little box roars like a jet engine. Really disappointing.",1
12547,"Do not use if you are also using RetinA. My skin became so red, irritated, & dehydrated. Made my acne worse.",2
12548,Purchased these three weeks ago and according to the estimated delivery date I may have to wait two more.....really hoping these earrings  are worth the wait,1
12549,good buy! if you don't mind waiting 6weeks.,4
12550,I am a hair stylist and i use these scissors everyday and love love love them!!,5
12551,excellent.  will never use ordinary floss again.  this is much more effective and comfortable,5
12552,"Smelled funny.  Couldn't use it, neither would my roommate.",1
12553,Doesn't trim well. Have to pass over multiple times and still not a good trim.,2
12554,This works well to help with frizzy hair especially in humid environments. Very concentrated so it lasts a long time.,4
12555,Unit leaks and flange holder cracks and breaks. Do not waste money. Waterpik gone downhill in quality.,1
12556,Works well...glowing skin....one star because the price tripled from my first order and it's only 2oz.  The price was my deal breaker.,1
12557,Holds clothes in place.  Great for keeping baby's socks on.,5
12558,Legwarmers fall to the ankle . . . I can fit TWO legs and one arm into one of these warmers!,1
12559,"Great for pressing hair, just don't put a lot of the product on hair.",4
12560,My dermatologist had me use this after I take a shower.  It doesn't have a scent and my skin's condition improved.,4
12561,It doesn't work! How do I send it back,1
12562,Absolutely love this product. Not hot to the touch and no vibration. Easy to use!,5
12563,"for some reason it doesn't dry, it gets creamy there and it's not exactly what I'd like to feel down there",1
12564,It works good.  It works just fine as advertised-not much else can be said about something that works good--it is fine product,4
12565,This product is easy to use. However it does not bond as well as other brands. I had lots of lifting.,2
12566,This is for pre showering not what I expected no real opinion. 9/20/16,2
12567,I use this often and think that this merchant is pretty good so far!,4
12568,"On me, this color is a nice nude color.  Perfect for everyday wear and it is matte, which I love.",5
12569,"Good bargain, Good shave. Each razor gives me at least five shaves.",4
12570,This perfume spray I received is a counterfeit and does not resemble the original fragrance of Paloma Picasso at all.,1
12571,Was what I was looking for works great in my camper,4
12572,7year old granddaughter has had great fun with it using it on her friends.,4
12573,"too bad,after i use it one time,and don't want to do that again.",2
12574,Color looks sexy on her. Doesn't stay on very well,3
12575,Good aftershave.  Matched the reviews I read about it.  Has a barbershop smell to it.  Nice packaging.  Has a classic feel to it.,4
12576,THIS IS NOT THE REAL BODY SHOP GLOVE.ITS A CHINES REPLICA. BEWARE,1
12577,"I bought this for my husband, & he told me it's a paste that didn't stay on his gums, like the gel does.",2
12578,Cuts an ok shave.  Don't last too long. OK overall!,3
12579,"Has shimmer. Otherwise, would have given 5 stars.",4
12580,"Love this stuff, makes me sweat a lot in the gym.",5
12581,"Very good blades, goes good  with the razor great, does a nice clean shave.",5
12582,Did not see any evidence of results. Basically a waste of money in my opinion.,2
12583,use these mitts for dry skin treatment as well as soothing heat with castor oil joint treatments for arthritic joints,5
12584,"Even though this is for women, I use it myself.

Gets you nice and clean with minimal irritation and no nicks or cuts.",5
12585,Really thin and paper like.  Does not hold your toes apart for long.  Did not like.,2
12586,excelent quality.  would be better if each sound is marked with the diameter.,4
12587,I din't see a difference I don't think it worked at all,1
12588,Seems to be a really good face cream without as many toxic chemicals. And at a reasonable price. Still looking for something more pure.,4
12589,My wife uses it and hasn't complained but I want Amazon to be up front about where the the product is originating from. Period.,1
12590,"Maybe my feet were not in bad shape, but I did not get any peeling whatsoever.",3
12591,"They are okay, the green doesn't seem to block the light out very well though.",3
12592,YOU RECEIVE MANY BRUSHES IN THIS SET BUT THE QUALITY IS NOT THE BEST ...BY FAR. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED.,2
12593,I love it super soft .Has a great smell..gives you a perfect shine and not sticky at all,5
12594,"This is really awesome and easy to use, especially for the price!  Two or three uses with this pays for itself!",5
12595,"My Aunt told me about this. When I smelled it, I was transported back to my childhood. Awesome salve.",4
12596,Scope Icy Mint Blast was 2.97 in October 2013. Now it's 13.69. Spit THAT out.,1
12597,It would have received 5 stars but there was no information stating it was organic.  There was no certification backing it up.,4
12598,My kit didn't come with the tips that was promised I want a refund,1
12599,"My granddaughter was so surprised when I handed this gift to her,she is delighted color is so bright ,it made her so happy",5
12600,Great quality and color true to the photo. I received it just a couple days after placing my order. Would definitely recommend to a friend.,5
12601,"This thing sounds like a car in your bathroom, and you have to refill the ""tank"" constantly.  I don't recommend this.",2
12602,Stopped functionning after 6 months. Was replaced by Philips for no additional charge. Works fine up to now. Would recommend product for easy oral care.,4
12603,These are a joke. Only buy if you're a size 0-00 and a cup sz a-,1
12604,"For the most part, they're good studs but a couple of them lost their stone as soon as I put it on.",3
12605,Nice thick tape and reminiscent of old unwaxed type used by dentists.,5
12606,Great product! Make my hair look really nice. I received A lot of complements.  I recommend this product for everyone.,4
12607,It's garbage. Not strong enough to clip a nail all the way through. Don't bother with this product.,1
12608,Easy to clean.  fits securely without bolts and brackets that rust.,4
12609,"It definitely decreases/gets ride of the itch. However, you must continue to use it everyday twice a day otherwise the itch will return.",5
12610,Quite disappointed with the packaging but I must say that it looks really cool! Very affordable.,4
12611,It was an ok product. But the material can be easily bent and broken.,2
12612,Cute but cheap. Slips of your head almost instantly. Ha to bobby pin them down. Bought two. Still cute tho.,3
12613,I am 34 with braces and this thing has saved my life.,5
12614,It's a pesonal grooming kit which is really good to have it does its job its a bargain exactly for the price totally recommend it,4
12615,"These sponges have held up very well. I wish they didn't stain as bad or were black. But, they are very durable.",4
12616,It was ok.  It seems to get clogged easily. I went back to mach 3 since it clogged less.,3
12617,Cute MINI brush.  I thought this product would be bigger since it says Mid-Size but its MINI size!,1
12618,"They do the job they are supposed too, but a little thin.",3
12619,"not good, the heater couldn't get the Jo done well, the mascara is not  also not good product, really disappointed!",1
12620,"i really liked this product.  never really bought ""lady"" shaving cream before.  My skin didn't react either.  Def would buy again.",4
12621,I used the black color and after two hours of application I still got a blond color.,2
12622,I used this along with the Fade cream. It makes your skin feel so soft and lasts a long time,5
12623,Pure disappointment! Tangled mess was all I got with this thing,1
12624,No flavor whatsoever. Spills easily. Sorry I ordered.,1
12625,I recommend this toner especially if you have a sensitive skin because the ingredients are pure organic and there's no perfume added in it.,5
12626,Love this product!  It works!!  My hair is healthy and has the luster. I recommend it!!,4
12627,"The shaver is good, the power is just so so, and curvature is not very good, not very clean after shaving!",4
12628,"It been 3 weeks now i started using the cream.not done all the magic it
Promised yet. But i still believe i can get some results later.",3
12629,"These don't really work and are very painful to wear would not buy again, took forever to get sent from China",2
12630,Fits my razor and my brush. Looks like it will fit most any standard sizes.,4
12631,"convenient to carry in wallet size, brushes are good quality, nice and practical.  The case is very nice, safe and has a premium appearance",5
12632,"It is a decent organizer, but it is smaller than it appears.  I thought that it would fit a tote.",2
12633,It seems like 3/4 through a shave then begin to dull. If you have very little facial hair it is no problem.,2
12634,It did not get hot enough to curl my hair.,2
12635,"I bought the wrong size, that's on me, but they are the right product, just the wrong size.",3
12636,"Exploded inside from the first use
And I wasted my time reading how to use it

Didn't last one day afterall",1
12637,works great a lot quiter then my old one comes with different picks for different uses witch is real nice,5
12638,Great feature that I could adjust water strength as my gums got stronger. Really seems to be making a difference than flossing.,5
12639,Pretty and still worth the price but I am not counting them to see if there really are that many there.,3
12640,the chain is to long from the finger to the wrist.,3
12641,So far so good. Only negative is it's made in China.,4
12642,Works well for what I use it for. Easy wash off and doesn't stain.,4
12643,Philips body shaver works very well.  I was amazed how gentle it is with sensitive skin areas.  Combs are absolutely necessary for heavy growth of hair.,4
12644,I LOVE THIS PRODUCT AND HAVE USED IT FOR YEARS....,5
12645,"These gloves run very short and barely cover my hands they should be longer, not satisfied",2
12646,The battery is good. It is quite sharp. So be careful. You need to practice for some times to control it.,4
12647,Color is very light and turned my hair a yellow-light brown color,1
12648,"Very strong fragrance. If you are sensitive to cologne, don't buy it. Otherwise, makes the skin soft after shave.",2
12649,This retinol is very gentle. Even for my sensitive skin I haven't had any redness or sensitivity.,5
12650,"These are wonderful. I never thought that I would ever see what 3000 nail gems looked like.
The plastic container is great!",4
12651,"I love the color and texture of this lip gloss and find it useful
for applying over my Iman lipsticks.",4
12652,i purchase this to practice but not even for that is good.. i don't like it.,2
12653,Didn't like the product at all. Dried up my hair and shade was much darker than expected.,1
12654,"Love this but there were no instructions at all included.  Wasn't hard to do, but maybe in future add instructions.  Thanks!",4
12655,Smelled terrible. (Like a vitamin) didn't work for me at all.,1
12656,If you get the right type of dental picks--wide thread--they are far more useful than this lousy floss. Save your money.,1
12657,came when said ...seems to do what i bought it for .,3
12658,LOVE IT!!!! i am so happy with this veil!!! defiantly a great buy!!!,5
12659,Perfecto = Perfect. It does the job of holding my razor and brush.,5
12660,Tag and chain are good. clasp for the chain sucks.,4
12661,Unfortunately it is already cracking and deteriorating. I think I need more ml.,2
12662,"Arrived way earlier than expected.  Looks just like the photo.  It is small though, which works great for me.  I would definitely purchase again.",5
12663,"If I know I would have to wait for a month, I definitely would not buy it!",1
12664,"Great quality however, the razor side does not hold the Gillette flex ball razor well",4
12665,Threads started coming apart on the 2nd day I had it. Great for my waves though until it falls apart.,3
12666,"I've used it for years at the recommendation of my dermatologist, and the lady who gave me a facial says my skin looks great!",5
12667,long lasting and simply need to buy replacement blades so often,5
12668,Used for a baby shower favor!! They were perfect,5
12669,I love the size and the heat is right with 2 settings.,5
12670,"received this item yestarday, the lid ( red colour) is broken. trying to figure out how to return this . such a big headache.",1
12671,The scent is nice and subtle and it comes with it's own powder puff. I think it was a good buy.,4
12672,"its a little more pink than I would like, other than that im happy with this product!",4
12673,"Very cheap material, and the gloves are sow crooked. Prob won't use them. Bought too, a waste.",1
12674,"fingers are not moveable and nailbeds are too long, this is not a good product to learn to do nails on",1
12675,I love the baby butter!!!! Does wonders on my baby hair!!!!,5
12676,"Mostly good, though expensive for what they are. Most flavors are true; some are not.",3
12677,a decent shaver in a long time. gives me one of the closest shaves ever.,4
12678,These are way too big. You have to shove them through your nose to get them in. It really hurt.,1
12679,Electric razors don't get a closer shave than standards ones so I got this.  This did not do the trick just smells bad.,1
12680,Great serum but I prefer the Vitamin C serum from OZ naturals,4
12681,"Although I'll keep it, four or five of the bristles have come off already, also, the writing on the handle has wiped off...",3
12682,got exactly what was in the picture! satisfied!!!,4
12683,Concealer fell out of the tube within days of getting it.,2
12684,they are as describes. Little small for my big peepers but works :),4
12685,The Imju Fiberwig Mascara has too many little specks and NOT for people wearing contact lenses.,2
12686,Noticed no change.  Not even in the smoothness  of my skin.,1
12687,"I ignored some of the reviews and regret it. The razors are terrible. If you want consistency, these will consistently rip your face apart.",1
12688,"Not completely circular, so it ends up crooked sometimes...other than that it's nice.",4
12689,Used this once and it's flattering and glittery which I love,4
12690,"Looks good price was reasonable l, but after a few months of usage by a 10 and 8 year old it's starting to come apart.",3
12691,Nothing cleans like the water pic. I gave it a 4 because I like more water pressure than this model puts out.,4
12692,"Color is great, but I don't like the feel of it on my hair.",4
12693,This is a great product. It helps to keep my skin looking young and beautiful.,4
12694,"Life size hand, wish it would bend at the fingers and stay in the bent position and a stand/holder would've been nice to have.",3
12695,My wife likes electric toothbrushes which are usually ugly in appearance. She is happy to have this cute device on our  bathroom counter.,5
12696,Great protection for your hands in UV nail curing lights.,4
12697,I have short hair.  This did not grip it securely to curl.,2
12698,Fell apart immediately.  I wore it for about an hour before it broke.,1
12699,I like this and use it on  my hair and have noticed a difference. Hair is naturally curly and dry.,4
12700,"Product defective, it spits out wildly.  I returned for a full refund.",3
12701,This product does exactly what it says it does. Excellent!,4
12702,this model compered to the other four that I have owned inthe pass years fells that the motor is weak has no power,3
12703,Made my face dry and tight. Wouldn't recommend.,2
12704,Great quality for the price. Gets the job done.,5
12705,"I have been using a waterpik for many dozen years.  It got me through braces and periodontal cleanings.
Cannot do without one.",4
12706,If you like an evening shadow this product is for you.  The blade is well dull with two shaves. Manufactured in Russia.,3
12707,So far so good. The colors are beautiful and the bar seems to be pretty tough. They are really nice!,5
12708,"Wish it wasn't petroleum based... otherwise this is the best for dry and cracked winter skin ever.

Couldnt of gone through the winter without it!",4
12709,"I sent an adulterated perfume, water and alcohol, odorless, they supposed to be an original perfume, that is of poor quality",1
12710,"Just a little dab will do ya. Leaves hair silky. I use three other products with it, but i just love it.",5
12711,"Not tapered enough for stretching, but comfortably shaped for insertion. Use these for deep insertions, if thats what your into.",2
12712,This product is great! Now my wife can keep her enormous bush nice and trimmed. Wish I knew about this product sooner.,5
12713,when I opened it the inside was all broken up it made a mess everywhere. It was very frustrating and hard to get cleaned up.,1
12714,"Fell apart 2nd use leaving element broken and exposed.
Too lightweight to affectively pull through hair
Thank goodness I was able to get a refund",1
12715,Still use this - its a great product and helps me with my gums which I have to keep clean.,5
12716,"It doesn't really seem to help after every shave. It gives me a red face, too. I think it's just not for me.",3
12717,"Love them.  They're a lil short, if that makes sense.  I def like it better than the l shaped ones.",4
12718,"I like the variable water pressure and the mulitiple picks. I use this at least 2 times a day, love itl",4
12719,I prefer the LaceFX brand. These don't stick well.,1
12720,Very convenient to use. I still like the product. I bought back perhaps to spare no power this thing comes in Dayong.,4
12721,Cute necklace for a young girl for dress up. Kind of cheap looking and cheaply made. Price is right in line with the quality,2
12722,Very nice- delicate looking- Shiny. Like it a lot.,4
12723,"Fast shipping, great product, smells amazing and leaves the skin silky and smooth. Spray on skin while wet or dry for immediate moisturizing.",5
12724,"This model is much easier to use than old model, more compact. I would have liked to have more water capacity.",4
12725,"This foot file is good as a finishing, smoothing touch after heavy duty foot scrubber. Just by itself it won't take care of calluses.",4
12726,They're were not the original genie bras..very disappointed!!  Was going to send back but too upset to bother!!,1
12727,"This does little or nothing for me. This does not work as well as Klima, which works a little for me.",2
12728,I wasn't really sure what this was for.. I thought was a clear base .,3
12729,Forgot I bought this. It didn't last a great deal of time though,2
12730,Only thing that made my baby girls reddness on her butt go away,5
12731,Hot on poor sore tongue & mouth. Like all Listerines.,2
12732,"Simple to use, has lasted over a year, good quality.",5
12733,Easy to use in the shower. Will know more how well it works at my dentist Appoinment ;-),4
12734,"No problem with the product, just not happy about Potassium Alum",1
12735,"I've been using these for 10 years, just rebuying them when I drop them in the toilet or break them. Cheap and easy!",4
12736,A lot of the tops of these cones were broken when I received the package so that was kind of disappointing,3
12737,Won't cover grey. Get Sally beauty supply color.,1
12738,"Just what the doctor ordered, literally. String flossers just didn't do it for me. The Waterpik  just works much better.",4
12739,"Too tick, and my hair turns white/unhealthy after use. Am not trilled
Sure will not Buy again",1
12740,"amazing greatest shaving cream ever, it leaves my legs so smooth and it smells great. I will never use anything else again",5
12741,Got my hands all black from the color. Couldn't even use.,1
12742,Compact and more quiet than the earlier model Waterpik this one replaced.  Wand hose storage is also a plus.  Would recommend.,4
12743,Fantastic Product.  Been using it for years! You'll want to use it will the conditioner as well.,5
12744,Shea Moisture is a organic product that takes care of my sons hair. Absolutely recommend for parents concerned about their babies hair care,5
12745,Good sharp razor blades for a good price. Would recomend.,5
12746,"Powder is expensive, but like the natural ingredients. This time my face feels oily than normal, not sure if it was this refill or not.",3
12747,"This is okay.  The taste is bad, and it doesn't whiten like they claim, but it does freshen your breath.",3
12748,"Good wig, just a little small. Should work for my Elsa costume for Halloween.",4
12749,Pretty but very fragile!  I wear it with a long sleeved shirt to give it some protection.,3
12750,It came loose.  It holds the razar and brush but wiggly.,2
12751,"Don't really know yet, I'm trying it I'll update my review later",2
12752,"not used frequently, very dry. You must apply the lip balm before use it.",3
12753,"Much smaller than expected, there are pillows out there that cost much less and are larger.",2
12754,Diffuser won't work and the bottle leaked about 50% of It's Contents.,1
12755,It's mouth wash and not much more. The taste/freshness tends to stick with you for a while. Would buy again.,4
12756,"I bought it as a gift to my nephew, he uses , no problem",3
12757,"Smells great, sort of messy if you have no where to put it in the shower but overall I would order this product again.",5
12758,"Buyer beware, the hose becomes brittle and breaks in 12-18 months.  Repair kits costs about $10 and requires mid-level handyman skill to replace.",1
12759,i wish this was Gel; like what i had before...oh well...;-(,2
12760,Love them. Their are a lot more than I though I would get,5
12761,They are super small. They wouldn't fit my nose,2
12762,Does the job that I need. I usually take the comb head off to get a close shave. Works great; great investment.,5
12763,"I love the color, but there's just a little too much glitter.  Going back to Orgasm.",4
12764,"Product is great for knocking out little particles, but is not a substitute for flossing. Waterpik is a more informative name than Water Flosser.",4
12765,Well I din't get what I ask for but I'm not buying from the same ppl no more that's simple.,1
12766,Nice peachy/pink color... My hairdresser had used this on me and I loved the natural look of the color,4
12767,No seal on bottle. Extremely runny. Like water. Seams tampered with.,1
12768,Was listed to fit my husbands razor and when it arrived it was not the right heads.,2
12769,So the charger got really hot and stopped working the first time charging the trimmer. Sometimes you just get what you pay for.,2
12770,"Doesn't get hot enough.  Just warm, so doesn't curl hair",1
12771,"I received my order on time, and the products were not broken which I was afraid of.....the smell is heavenly Caress body washes never fail",4
12772,Good fit and I can actually feel the difference of wearing it vs using the lamp on exposed skin - will never cure again without it.,5
12773,"LOVE the body butter, don't fancy the body lotion.",3
12774,Great product! I just needed some wipes to take off excess wax off.,4
12775,"Love the smell, works, and the soft skin feeling at the end is the best.  Highly recommend",5
12776,I love this product so much bought for my Mother for Christmas and she loves it..........,5
12777,Taking way to freaking long don't even want it anymore,1
12778,Can be a little messy but definitely helps cover the grays in between appointments.,4
12779,"I was expecting more of a BayRum scent, but still a fine aftershave",4
12780,I really like the brushes. They were better than I expected and the price was less than I had expected!,4
12781,"Good performance, a new experience for me. Almost as good as an electric brush. However it does leak and drip water in the wrong places.",4
12782,"Love this brand, but don't feel right using it as long as it's tested on animals. Hope they become cruelty-free again soon!",1
12783,I am somewhat disappointed in this Visco-Gel Toe Buddy.  It is a little bit too loose and often slides off,3
12784,"Very thin will be extremely difficult to have your name embroidered but I like the pockets.  Overall not bad, but I wish were thicker material.",3
12785,"Perfect, fast, and bottle was sealed up so it couldn't leak.",5
12786,It doesn't grab my hair so it's kind of useless!,1
12787,"I find myself waking up in the middle of the night with the scarf off my head, so I have to constantly re-adjust it.",3
12788,my wife has been using this item for years. She love it.,5
12789,It's a nice cuticle oil but it's orange. Really orange.,3
12790,So tight around my already medium/small head that it won't stay put and emediatly rolls down over my eyes.,1
12791,"I wouldn't recommend buying this to anyone. The picture is misleading, the book holder I got was very poorly made, the craftsmanship was terrible.",2
12792,"Deters lice but gave my children chemical burns on their neck. If using, only spray on hair and avoid skin.",2
12793,My son loves theme and theyou are easy to use.,4
12794,They kind of stretch out... but what hair tie doesn't?  Really gentle on your hair.,4
12795,Product was received as described. This product helps toes align. I believe that it works for me. My toes are doing much better.,4
12796,I like these they fit perfect I was just not happy that I couldn't pick a color. I wanted pink..,4
12797,great for a beginner but eventually an upgrade will be necessary,3
12798,Iwas disappointed in this product. It was made for a very small child and was not advertised as such!,1
12799,"not that good as I expect. But overall, it works well.",3
12800,They're good. The only problem I had was that a few of the smaller balls broke when I went to go screw them on.,4
12801,These we're so sharp and gave me no a nice clean up cut.,5
12802,DO NOT ORDER THESE! THEY CAME FROM CHINA AND WERE JUST BAD!!! NOT WHAT IS DESCRIBE AT ALL,1
12803,"Cute, but mine fell apart before I even got to use them :-(",2
12804,Fit well but one side...the lense has a little gap on the edge that allows light in.,1
12805,"hard to pick up the tiny pieces, but it did come with nail glue which is handy.  shipping took a long time",3
12806,"works fine, might be more environmentally damaging than the mylar packets they used to use.",4
12807,Great rods but impossible to organized back into the bag after you used them. I used this in synthetic hair and the result were good,4
12808,not the same that came with my Emjoi will not order agian,2
12809,"Love all the colors, would definitely buy again once I run out, but I won't run out for a while!",5
12810,These are definitely not one size fits all. I am a petite woman and the fingers are very big. A waste of money for me.,3
12811,Unit mounted to wall and hold all of my wife's items as she wanted great product,4
12812,Still do not know whey Old Spice discontinued this it is their best scent..,5
12813,Bought this years and years ago. Still kickin'!,5
12814,the worst electric shaver I have ever used. I want my money back! only thing that works is the trimmer that pops up.,1
12815,"I liked it but its bulky and I went through two in a year, the quality isn't great.",3
12816,"Haven't used it much but I'm sure it will be good--it is
basically zinc oxide ointment ( which I could have
bought OTC).",4
12817,Works well. My nails don't grow well but break less with this product.,4
12818,"Gives me a really close shave,very easy to maintain.
Very flexible for traveling.
What else can you ask for.
.",4
12819,Thank goodness I found these! I looked in stores locally for ages for replacement bulbs for my vanity mirror... these bulbs were what I needed!,5
12820,"Works great, easy to install. It only gets 4 stars because of the price point.",4
12821,Spills to the side when you pour it due to its opening.,3
12822,It was a bit darker than I expected but it's not unusable.,4
12823,"These are fine as light blockers, I received a black one",3
12824,I got this for my son. He likes it better than the Oral B that he has been using.,4
12825,It's OK.  attractive but I actually prefer my mug.,3
12826,"After using this item I still feel the need to floss.  So why do I need this product?
I do not recommend this item.",2

these things don't trim hair at all!

junk",1
12829,Excellent product and very easy to use. It really works for nail fungus.,5
12830,"the tie on the back is not good, it's often too large for clients. a snap back closure would be much better.",2
12831,"This actually made my skin dark, so I stopped using it.",2
12832,"the color shown wasn't the true color, it was much more pink than a peach color",2
12833,this is a necessary item if you have a philips razor.  easy to use and great for razor maintainance.  a great buy!,4
12834,took too long to come in other than that I love them. THANK U,4

12837,Great gift! They love it. Great quality and value. I will check in to see how its held up soon.,5
12838,Does not work. I wanted to return it but realized I misplaced the box. When I found the box it was past the allowable return date.,1
12839,Good quality blades. No receptacle for disposal provided. This will not stop me from re-ordering,4
12840,I use this comb right after I get out of the shower. Works just great.,4
12841,The bristles have started coming off and the metal part is getting detatched from most brushes. They do work well and blend well.,4
12842,Huge....just like I wanted.  Nicely made....keeps your head dry.,4
12843,I ordered this set and it came to me a month late. The studs are not as great and will most likely turn my skin green.,3
12844,doesn't really work for a tablet. the corner pieces sit on the on/off button :(,2
12845,"Well I purchased this product and so far I haven't gotten any reactions from any guys, going to keep using it to see if it works.",3
12846,Misleading  ad and it doesn't meet expectations for me.  I have brown age spots and it doesn't cover them at all,1
12847,Bottle came half empty and is missing the top cap.  Looks like cream has already been used.,1
12848,This was a 15 yr. old granddaughter gift and she loves it !!!,5
12849,"After reading the instructions, I charged the unit for 7 hours as indicated.  I, then used it for around 15-20 seconds and it stopped working.",2

12851,"Nice rechargeable trimmer.

I really like it.

All of the attachments have been more useful than I expected.  That's all.",4
12852,"It's just a sticker, a big sticker for your stomach. Lol what a waist of money, and then it barely sticks. Highly disappointed!",1
12853,Oh yeah kiss proof! I Really like this product and it's very affordable. ,5
12854,I actually ordered 2 sets and never received the second set... Brushes are great though. Would be great if I had my other set..,2
12855,"Not original Astra, packaging is different, quality too,not the astra i used to use",2
12856,This is so cheap. I should've known.... you really do get what you pay for.,1
12857,Im not sure if it works on the blakheads because its so harsh onthe skin. Very stron if u have sensitive skin u definately better try something else,1
12858,This is truly what you pay for the brushes do not pick up make up well. There all like 2 that truly that honestly work.,2
12859,"Very nice....fits my small wrists well. ...and looks like silver.
Please make some in a gold tone.",4

12862,Love this stuff & what a Great price compared to local shops,5
12863,I bought this and Estee Lauder Pure Color Lasting Lip Creme. The colors are very similar. Both last just as long.,4
12864,"Not for dry skin, it kinda makes things worst.",2
12865,"Nice color, have no idea why it is ""amplified"" though. Seems the same as classic Manic Panic.",4
12866,I upgraded from a much older version and am happy my choice.  I like the features but will only use the basic style tips.,4
12867,Saves so much time to add a little curl at the same time as drying.,4
12868,Was looking for LEE pharmaceuticals and got some other places stuff.,2
12869,I like it...bigger than i thought...will recommend to buy it,3
12870,"I have used it twice, but will have to get my old man to help.",4
12871,"Needed for military.  Not at all tight like the picture and can't make it that tight.  Can't use at all, very disappointed.",1
12872,Can anyone get the larger ones inside them other wise they are good,4
12873,"This is fantastic.  I have lupus and it gives me great coverage, especially on my face.",5
12874,"Works, but is obviously not an original manufacture item.  Seems cheaply made.",2
12875,It's not a super deal. Good product at an average price,3

12877,weighted down hair....a lot of product build up....never produced any shine,1

12883,Love the quick shipment. And the fact I was able to get all these different prices at a great deal compared to competitors.,4
12884,I just got this the other day and have been using this.  It seems to be working.,4
12885,This isn't quite as strong holding as I'm used to but definitely no frizz.,4
12886,It's going to take some practice to get it only on my roots and not all over my face!,2
12887,"One of the best, most natural blushes on the market!",5
12888,"doesn't heat up as well i expected it too, thus not giving you a really strong curl",2
12889,The bulbs didn't work in my mirror even though it said it would,1
12890,"The smell wasn't very strong, it smelled like the cardboard box.",4
12891,Their nice hover when I received I didn't get them all and some were missing,1
12892,"It was a lot smaller than I expected but it came earlier on time, you could barely see the design ok overall good for the price",3
12893,Doesnt work and I have enough hair for wax strips to work :/,1
12894,"Not working for me.  Dark spots are still there, used daily no improvement.",2
12895,great toner with very monimal alcohol. I found a dupe for it which works  about the same. (Store brand toner).,4
12896,Works good however gets your hands really dirty.  Much better pricing than salon.,3
12897,"Not my favorite smelling tea tree oil, but it gets the job done",4
12898,"Great price, quick ship. I love these brushes. One brush fell apart but the rest were solid. Didn't matter at that price.",4
12899,"Love this product.  It is not greasy, and the SPF 50 is a plus.  I will continue to purchase.",5
12900,I got this bracelt for my daughter & she loved it. Its a beautiful bracelet at a great price. I would recommend this product.,5
12901,"Well, the dog hates it when I aim at her. Cleans my teeth well too. Dentist on my case to use one.",5
12902,"This is the authentic Braun Clean & Renew Refill.....  There are several advertised, but I stick with this for the price and quality.",4

12904,Great trimmer. My first one and it was delivered quickly.,4
12905,is to big i order small size and look like L omg i look fat on this jacket Dont Buy it no work and no sirveeeeeeeee bicht,1
12906,I've used this product before.  It's great to hold your curls!,5
12907,"Very nice color, but it dries out your lips like no other!",2
12908,I love the look of the dish however it doesn't fit the soap the I purchased that was recommended by Amazon. Still a beautiful dish.,4
12909,I love all Crew products so it was no surprise when I tried this for the first time and it was excellent. Never felt cleaner.,4
12910,the fit was horrible for a little kid - way too small for a 6 year old,1
12911,"Really good color, but it's not moisturizing at all. I recommend putting a clear chapstick on over this lipstick to moisten your lips!",4
12912,"Wouldn't mind a more comfortable handle area.
Maybe some sharper finger tips to scratch a little harder.
Long enough for tall people.",3
12913,"These work like they're supposed to, but the razor has to be in good shape!",4
12914,bristles are a little more stiff then the philips brand but not bad for the price.,4
12915,Replacing the heads made my shaver good asnew at a considerable savings. Installation is really simple.,4
12916,"works well, kind of a messy procedure, probably my own fault, arrived with a broken lid but Amazon gave me credit",4
12917,Doesn't look great on dark skin. Also comes on chalky.,2
12918,"I am already a baseball fan and knew a bit about the Negro leagues, but I learned a lot more reading this book.",5

12924,"I brought this bonding glue like a couple of
 times already.",3
12925,my mom loves Jean ate she has been using it for years:),4
12926,"Not Sharp. Doesn't hold an edge. Basically I used these for projects instead of shaving,",1
12927,I purchased this item with the idea the shave soap were in it.  To my surprise it isn't but the container is good.,4
12928,Don't buy it as it does not hold the wig in place not a strong bonding glue.,1
12929,"wonderful product, have used it for years, never disappoints",5
12930,"This stuff works. The only drawback is that you have to keep applying it, and applying it, and applying it.",5
12931,Its a good product and cheaper than Van Der Hagen.. Just need a good soap or shave cream. Just fine.,4
12932,"pretty sharp, and kind of took some skin.  It also kind of looks like a blackhead when it's in your nose...",3
12933,I have purchased this from other places also and I really like this color on me. I get many complements when I wear it.,4
12934,The color was way too dark.......not what I call light brown,2
12935,These were so amazing it came very organized and with a huge selection. Love them,4
12936,"Great Powder for Men and gives a chillingly tingly feeling. Very refreshing and smells good to
while keeping you dry.",5

12938,Irritated my skin and gave me a rash.  Had to stop using half-way through first stick.,2
12939,Formula is different.  Doesn't work like it used to.  :-(,2
12940,I bought this for my dad for Father's Day and he says he likes is,4
12941,This thing is Flimsy...the shape distorted after working 2 lochs.,3
12942,Ordered this item and it states pack of 4... when it arrived it was a single retailer... would not order again,1
12943,Did not relieve extreme cracking of hands. Really disappointed! So I use it as facial night treatment. Not bad at all!,2
12944,Love this product. My skin felt softer and firmer within just 2 days,5
12945,Good value for the money. The only negative comment I have is that it runs out of water very fast..,4
12946,Exactly as shown in picture in proper packaging. I'm not too confident about the threading but we'll see,4
12947,i am 90 years old  i don't have a pruny  facial  have been using  this product  for 5 years  and look  70,5
12948,I Spray on after  hair is done and it really adds volume. Not sticky and smells nice. Does not dull hair.,5

12950,This was a waste of money...not impressed at all...saw no benefits....highly would not recommend this product.  Increased your money on this.,1
12951,Skin did not improve. Felt like using scented water.,1
12952,The razor is good but not any better than the cheaper models.  See the Norelco website for the full product line and prices.,3
12953,"The battery quickly degraded after a few months and the head broke, so the cutter wouldn't stay attached the warranty process wasn't worth it.",2
12954,Worked really well and the stick makes it an easy application for the face.,4
12955,"Stable, looks simple but elegant, and holds my razor and brush without issue.",5
12956,Garbage they are flimsy and fell apart before I took them out of the bag.,1
12957,only recieved half of the product. not very happy. i would like more or a refund okay. thanks. wouldnt Buy again.,2
12958,"Product differs from image displayed. All said and done, this is the best product in the AXE range of bodysprays. Not overwhelming.",3
12959,Not to be used with crowns and fillings. Dentist said it was like pressure washing the cement of my crown and knocked it off.,2
12960,Not true to the color and wears out after first use. Hated this product and regret buying it,2
12961,Very nice cream.  Not greasy and only need a small amount.,5
12962,This spray is pretty amazing and seems to work well in combating strong underarm odor. Very happy with the results.,4
12963,"Really nice, barbells are shorter than regular so they are sort of tight,",3
12964,"Most of them are sharp enough for shaving, but I've run into enough dull blades to not be completely happy.",3
12965,It did not get hot enough to curl my hair.,2
12966,These pads are very small.  Bought them for the men in my house but I think they are made for women.,2
12967,I didn't find it sharper compared to Merkur blades. Returning the 5 pack.  Quality of steel is good tough.,2
12968,just need case so gave away brushes .good brushes just did not need fast service nice case. pink is ok wish for better color choice,4
12969,"These are pretty good, they came quickly, and they smell great. They don't really taste that much like anything though.",4
12970,you can buy in walmart for cheaper price. the lotion spilled in the box when it arrived.,2
12971,"Nice, very soft leather. It has two roommy pockets.",4
12972,"Works well and leaves hair soft and not stiff. Unfortunately, I hear that Tigi is discontinuing all men's hair products.",5
12973,as promised.  I use this for a variety of reasons and I like the bigger bottle.,4
12974,Goes on kind of sticky. Good for a beach day but doesn't seem to be suited for everyday use due to the stickiness.,4
12975,"Made my hair brittle and dull looking, didn't do anything for the itch or dandruff.",1
12976,Thought I was buying clear sleeves but turned out they were white which was my fault. But they do seem cheaper than other sleeves I've seen.,4
12977,Nice color.  I use it as an overlay to a darker color.  It lasted all day,4
12978,"It is beautiful and very magical looking. Quickly charged, just hold it to a light! Im glad to have bought it!",4
12979,"This will leave a almost nail polish like coat on top of your lipstick. This is perfect for costume makeup, not so great for everyday wear.",4
12980,Love this product! Not greasy. First introduced at my salon. Have been using it for about 2 years.,4
12981,There's not much to say here - I like these toothbrushes.  I've been using them for years. They are just right for me.,4
12982,COLORS ARE NICE BUT TOO CLOSE TO BEING THE SAME COLOR.,3
12983,"Only ordered this because it was so cheap, bottom line is Listerine is the way to go for mouthwash, no others compare.",3
12984,Beautiful and well made but the cape's button is difficult for a child to fasten.,4
12985,This oil is of very poor quality. I have bought pure oils from other companies and this one is very low quality,2
12986,This soap left my skin feeling smooth and soft and the scent is divine ! I will be buying more for sure!!,5
12987,like the feeling after putting it on my face.  so far so good.,4
12988,Works as described.  I hope it will help me improve the condition of my mouth.,5
12989,Super stiff and scratchy and not in a good way....hoping it softens a little. Seems to be a very cheap material .,2
12990,Works great very satisfied with the product would order another one if I ever needed it,4
12991,The glitter sits on top of the shadow put does not go all the way through it...it is nice shadow but not truly diamond glitter.,3
12992,I loved the color BUT I thought it was color stay.  It's not.,4
12993,"Don't love the water splashing everywhere but perhaps I'll get used to it eventually. Does the job it's supposed to do, however.",3
12994,"I was very please with this item. They were longer than I had thought, which was great. They work nice and I am happy,",5
12995,"No visual difference on my skin, and I hate the runny watery consistency.",1
12996,Works well. My nails don't grow well but break less with this product.,4
12997,These were unusable.  The have plastic posts and plastic covers for the posts. I've never seen anything like them before.  They are throw aways!,1
12998,This product works great and it is comparable to a much more expensive Bumble and Bumble - it is definitely Medium Brown not light brown.,4
12999,Not one of the best razors I've used but I must say it still gives a decent enough shave.,3
13000,"Thought it would spin on it's own, but so far I'm liking it ok.",3
13001,What exactly what I expected. Came packaged well and at reasonable price. Would buy again.,5
13002,"Positive: they fit comfortably and its easy to size them up to fit yourself

Negative: they are very hard to see out of at all.",3
13003,Did not get anything close to resembling what is shown.  net sleeve only with no draw string...just two open ends.  Not worth sending back.,1
13004,"Would have given it 5 stars, love the flavor, and the fact that it is a great salt substitute, but I think it is overpriced.",4
13005,"Works fine... but you get maybe 2 or 3 shaves (days) and it needs recharging, again.",3
13006,"They work on wrinkles, but wear out fast, and they cause acne breakouts.",2
13007,This cream is a good moisturizer at an affordable price. I can't say more since I just have been using it for a couple of days.,4
13008,If I could I would give this place no stars I ordered a cap and got nothing but an empty box,1
13009,Haven't had it long enough to tell but other than that my mom seems to like it so its fairly good,3
13010,I have used this brand before and liked it. However the product arrived damaged and unusable.,1
13011,I have sensitive skin.  This is the best moisturizer I have ever found that also contains sunscreen for protection in the Arizona sun.  Perfect.,5
13012,The pot is extremely small! There isn't eough cream to even last till you see a difference. Don't see any difference.,1
13013,"Excellent product, works as described.  Arrived on time, Amazon packaging excellent as always",5
13014,I like using this better than flossing and my teeth and mouth feel much cleaner than with flossing.  Great product.,4
13015,It's just a get what you pay for item... handles fall apart and the brushes are too coarse.,2
13016,Product designed very well. East to use and would recommend it to anyone with a lot of body hair.,5
13017,great price. Love that these are 2 sided for removal of tough/dead skin. Leaves you feeling clean and fresh,4
13018,"Great product...fast delivery...although, i think the honey wax works a little better than the creme wax but its still good!",4
13019,"They don't stay at all, it says 2-3 weeks and mine lasted about 4 days and I was sadly disappointed.",1
13020,Love the smelll and soap leaves my skin feeling so clean and soft,5
13021,Cleaning power is great but.....the blue button on the handle is sticking. And we have only had this product a few weeks.,2
13022,My families favorite soap. Other brands of this have a fishy or oily smell. This brand is a perfect mix of scent.,5
13023,The best system for the money. Does everything above the neck that the big boys do.,5
13024,"Brush head was great while it lasted, wore out real quick for some reason, only had it for a few weeks and it became disfigured",3
13025,"These scissors are great, very sharp and cuts my dogs hair with ease",4
13026,"Very easy to use - and the 1 inch diameter. useful with my short hair-do.
Easily cleaned and electric cord long enough for ease of use.",4
13027,It WAS super cute. Until the two crosses fell off a week later. Got delivered to my house in time.,2
13028,"Suction wasn't there to hold into place.  Smooth surface needed, not intended for tiled showers.",2
13029,Look nice with my any dress. Very cute and stand out!,4
13030,"Of all the blades I tried, these lasted the longest, pulled the least.",4
13031,"Smooth shave, but irritates sensitive skin. Must be patient with skin while getting use to this shaver",4
13032,"I am happy with this inexpensive hair styling cape.  The quality is better than expected, and very roomy.",5
13033,They are easyly stained but they worked well and are VERY SOFT :),4
13034,i can not use this product the smell is awful.and my name is zayna not emma.  please get my name right,1
13035,Is very light sometimes I mix it with another make up for better coverage.,4
13036,I did research before I purchased it and the  Pine Tar is acting product in this jar. The smell is horrible but so far so good.,3
13037,I like the brushing part that this item is used for the price is decent and it was shipped right to my door.....,3
13038,"I found this to be a good flossing machine
Would recommend it leaves your mouth feeling refreshed",4
13039,It actually works.  Nees a bit more power on high.,4
13040,"I found this to be a good flossing machine
Would recommend it leaves your mouth feeling refreshed",4
13041,I've had it for about a month and my belly button is still infected. It's not much of a help,1
13042,"This dries into a sticky, waxy film. Not pleasant.",2
13043,"Received with broken clasp , feel off as soon as package was opened . Cute design. Not functional closure .",1
13044,"Hose is not very flexible, and after 10 uses it cracked apart right in the middle of the hose.",1
13045,"Obsessed with this.  Great for smoothing your skin, especially your back.  I'm amazed by how smooth my skin is.",5
13046,made my hair very manageable now. which give me a very sleek look.plus add styling gel and you got a great look,4
13047,My other one quit after several years... and I really missed it.  My mouth fees so much better after a good cleaning with my waterpik.,4
13048,They were prompt in replacing my defective product.  Thank you!,4
13049,"Product was as described.
Pleasure doing business with you.",5
13050,Arrived super fast. Very soft and for the price it's well worth it,4
13051,"Great bowl for storing soaps, I use this for the soap and another bowl to make the lather.",4
13052,This does the trick along the bikini area. The only thing i wish was different so that it was adjustable. Decent price.,4
13053,100% natural product with natural scent. Completely neutral and pleasant.,5
13054,I believe the product was faulty. Better quality control may help spot items like this. Razor was fully charged but stopped while I was shaving.,1
13055,"It think this is meant for children but I have a small head and for one night, it did the job.",4
13056,this product smells great and may be edible but it has no flavor at all. don't buy if you want flavor this has none,1
13057,Everything came. The needle is sharp so it was quick and easy. I really like this. I recommend this to everyone.,5
13058,It came with a 2 thin white pieces of left over fabric..! $6 for this piece of s***...!,1
13059,"Every time I wear Pure Instincts I get more compliments, conversation and friendliness. Thats why I keep using the product.",4
13060,Works very well and its nice that the base has a little trap door to store the extra parts when you are not using them.,4
13061,"It's cute, the bow area looks like it was done by a small child, does not look like the picture.",3
13062,This is a great little stand. Perfect for my razor and brush. Looks nice too.,5
13063,To bad they have discontinued. Bought 5 bottles prior to discontinue. Great aroma from the produce but doesn't last long enough,5
13064,Working great for my manicuring needs..thick enough to hold around the nail when stamping or doing gradients,4
13065,Colors are not all different u get two of each color,3
13066,for a person who doesnt shave before now this is great,4
13067,Did not lower sensitivity at all.  Real waste of money.,1
13068,not the same color as the one i bought in stores although they are the exact same number.,1
13069,"I DON'T FEEL THIS HAS ANY PHEROMONE ACTIVITY WHATSOEVER.  IT SMELLS ""OK"", BUT NOT LIKE THE REVIEWS MADE IT SOUND.",3
13070,This is a pretty hard toothbrush. I have no idea why they'd even describe it as soft. Not what the dentist ordered.,2
13071,"They were okay...kinda makes me break out
Cute colors though.
also i don't use the brush because they were flimsy.",3
13072,"Excellent shaving. Much better than my Panasonic.

Shaving the neck is little tricky and needs little bit more work than face.",4
13073,"Great quality but doesn't come with a very good foundation brush, it's too small to use for foundation",3
13074,Nice wig but too big for my 6 year old. More for an adult,4
13075,OK fragrance. Certainly a good quantity for a reasonable price.,3
13076,Very cheap look. Eye fell out in bag before I could give it to someone,1
13077,It came in damaged.  One sleeve had the cuff hardly sewn on at all.  There was about 4 inches that were not sewn together.,1
13078,I used this product on my sensitive skin and it was great. BUT the smell was pretty off. I probably wouldn't buy it again.,3
13079,This came with lots of great brushes. So many different shapes and sizes to choose from. Very nice quality brushes as well.,4
13080,"Very good brushes, but they're more for like eyes... Not all face.",4
13081,Very nice and quick delivery. It came in a nice plastic sleeve and had a surprising amount of detail.,5
13082,"Love this color, stays on fresh for several weeks .",5
13083,These are not bad for the price. They aren't the greatest quality but they are good for traveling or on the go.,4
13084,My daughter didn't like this product.  Only used it once.  Doesn't leave your hair feeling smoth.,2
13085,If you're just stating to shave with a safety razor use these until you get used to it. Then switch to feather blades.,4
13086,works so-so. doesn't conceal w/o a lot of spraying.,3
13087,The Anti-Monkey Butt Powder is pink and leaves pink on the clothing.,3
13088,"Unit working good, two issues, no pressure adjustment and on/off is reverse, you hold the button to stop water.",4
13089,"Good razor stand.  Holds razor and brush well, looks great.",4
13090,As a diabetic I needed some help with e d and this has worked wife smiles ever time I walk in the room and let it all hang out,5
13091,"Have never use water flossers until dentist recommended same.  The water pick was fantastic immediately stopped gum soreness and cleaned between teeth great.
Dave Thomas",5
13092,2days late on package. only get 2 sponges not 3 as shown in pic. It is made very cheap. You cannot go by the picDeceiving,1
13093,There is a lot of pieces but they are way too small and they loose their shine once put on the nail.,3
13094,I have been wanting something that would help me apply lotion to my bag. This works great for that. I like the other attachments also.,4
13095,"Smelled funny.  Couldn't use it, neither would my roommate.",1
13096,"Used this one for my baby girl. Her skin is very sensitive, but it turns out this one fits her well.",5
13097,"I'm happy to say this product works, and quickly!",5
13098,IT gets crusty if you let your lips get dry. So you need to continuously apply chap stick and try to avoid licking your lips,5
13099,"It a nice product, only my hair is too thick for it to wrap around and close.",3
13100,"I've had it before and I liked it a lot. So When I needed another for travel, I had to go straight for it.",4
13101,"Small, but effective. A little bit noisy, but it does the job. I recommend this model. Works well for the cost.",4
13102,It is suppose to be a rotating barrel.  It doesn't rotate as I expected.  I do like the ability to remove and clean the brush,3
13103,"Not a big fan, it stains my lips, very hard to get off :( get what u pay for with this product.",2
13104,Dont buy it. It wasn't even the color i ordered. They sent me a nude pink color instead of red,1
13105,Dull quickly.  I get 1 good shave per blade. I do have a tough beard tho.,3
13106,"Excellent stand, looks nice holding my Parker 76R Butterfly Open Double Edge Safety Razor and my brush.",5
13107,"The studs are great, however I received only clear.",4
13108,Not pictured as shown. It was so small. Child size. Did not like it at all.,1
13109,The beauty bun product burned my skin.  Fair skin people should not use it. I was on fire.,2
13110,Either these don't work or I just never placed them correctly.  But for me these were a waste of money.,1
13111,better than expected.  Battery life has been over a week.  Shave is very smooth.  Very quiet.  I'd strongly recommend.,5
13112,Is the first time that i use this product and its good to use.  I recommended to womens who have an damage eye area.,4
13113,I got multiple of the same color and one of them didn't have a stone,2
13114,It is a very dry lipstick.  Makes my lips feel dehydrated and the color is strange.  But.. I guess you get what you pay for!,1
13115,"Great little stand.  Looks good and fits the brush and razor nicely.
Exactly what I was looking for.",4
13116,"A lot smaller than expected, but still very cute :)",3
13117,Unfortunately these did not fit the cards that my son was using them for. They were too small.,3
13118,bought for a gift.  it serve its purpose but there are very stiff for applying eyeshadow,4
13119,It holds fine but i was a little disappointed because it left a white residue on my edges...,3
13120,It is exactly like the pic fits my phone perfectly and is very pretty i love my new case,5
13121,The packaging just smelled like straight plastic and the brushes were mediocre. The brushes all fell off the stick. You get what you paid for.,3
13122,Stopped working and I really did not use it that often. It worked ok while it lasted but there are better products.,1
13123,I have also noticed brown staining on the gumline of my teeth.  I tried to have them whitened and nothing worked.  Don't use this product.,1
13124,"I am happy to buy this product and really is worth the experience, Disadvantage of this product is somewhat high voice.

Thank you",4
13125,I'm new to shaving with double edge razors. The Wilkinson is better than the blade provided with the merker razor.,4
13126,"Softer tips than the last few I bought at the store, some are not coated the whole way to the tip, but they work.",3
13127,"Really nice. However, it was all just one color not like shown on picture :/",4
13128,I have always used Trim clippers. But out of the 6 2 have broke inside of 2 weeks. Sad.,3
13129,Missing the bling part and haven't even gotten a response of what can I do what a waste of money,1
13130,Do not like the product.  Every time your hair gets wet the color comes out  on towels etc.,2
13131,Get almond flavor. Other smells are OK but almond one is best by far,4
13132,"Works pretty well, though for the price you can get much better quality ones in-store by Sally.",3
13133,Little bit too rough kinda hurts when using. Other than that does the job.,3
13134,the brushes are not high quality but really good for the price,4
13135,Very small stones omg u cant see it really when they r in,2
13136,I really like this stuff but it is way too expensive compared to other products i have seen,4
13137,Products material was too thin and quality was of product was poor. You get what you pay for.,2
13138,Good product. Wish it came with disposal container as some other blades do.,4
13139,"Love the beauty blender, works just like the one I bought from a major store chain. Ordered a few more too!!",4
13140,"It looks pretty good after using the cream, however it doesn't get rid of the root of hair. Waxing probably stays longer.",4
13141,the wig is very nice but does need some styling. the hair net it comes with is poor in quality. otherwise great product!,4
13142,Taste good and lasts a long time. Zylitol is toxic and one of the ingredients.,4
13143,I sent it back.  My manual flosser works better and is a lot less expensive.,1
13144,"A bit noisy but cleans,cleans,cleans!  Much better experience than ancient string floss method.",5
13145,"I have not noticed any difference.  In fact, I would like to have my money back.",1
13146,"Razor is okay, Bath died in about 9 months.",3
13147,I am still using the cream and have not had any positive compliments as yet but I see great changes,4
13148,Loved the color but it was fragile and the plastic stud was bented!,4
13149,Much smaller than expected (I thought it would be a normal size hair brush) but perfect for a purse or to keep at work.,4
13150,Not a bad product but I like the muk in the orange container way better,4
13151,"Provides support for my ""traveling toe"".  Great price, delivered in a timely way.",4
13152,gets stuck in poclet and the ipod ends up coming out of my pocket alone thwn i have to reach for the case,4
13153,"I haven't seen much of an improvement, but must admit that I haven't used the product regularly.",3
13154,I love the color.  Just never stayed on my head.  Would it recommend.,3
13155,This was my first time trying Mia and it works very well. I will buy again.,5
13156,the only problem is you have to buy glue for them separately but you could also subsitute the glue for a top coat.,5
13157,"These are a lot bigger than they look In the picture, and I will not be wearing them!",1
13158,This toner had something wrong with it.  I have purchased many times and this time it was brownish color and smelled awful!,1
13159,"these are nice to make lotions, candles, etc.",5
13160,I have purchased this product many times over. I absolutely love it. It keeps me dry and swamp ass at bay.,5
13161,Great colors and pigment! Although one of the browns were crumbled when delivered.,4
13162,It Does it job.  I had a very hard time finding this product in stores for the past 3 or 4 months,3
13163,Smells very good...no results for me as far as product promises,2
13164,I've found that these were a little dry and not as great as my regular wipes. Just go get the Neutrogena ones at the drugstore.,3
13165,High quality wood bowl. I did not realize how much I would miss not having a handle on the bowl though...,4
13166,No instructions at all like really??? I really guess you pay for what get.,1
13167,They aren't 1/4 size hoops they're 5/16 and the metal seems really cheap. But they are the right color at least,2
13168,Would purchase this wig in every color.  Style was glamourous. Color was beautiful and hair felt like silk.  Rally loved it.,5
13169,"Not great for a close shave for the bikini line, but is good for ""landscaping"".",4
13170,"there is no fabric on the back, how do they expect the hair to get caught???",2
13171,"Excellent product.  Recommended by my dermatologist as the ""best"" over-the-counter product to remove dead skin.  Fresh (non-perfumey) scent.",5
13172,"its OK, not as much power as would have liked.",3
13173,Razor and stand were both sturdy and I liked the fact the blades were individually wrapped.,4
13174,"Amazing value for an awesome game.
Insane replay value, very fun multi-player.
Stealing loot from your friends is always fun!",5
13175,Makes shaving go faster and smother. Nice to shave while in the shower. Holds a charge for a good  week before having to charge again!,4
13176,Cheap for a reason. Don't waste your money.,2
13177,They are not easy to pull off. They tore. The only quality I like about this product is after you got them put on they stayed on,2
13178,This is the only type of perfume my Grandma (84) will wear. She loves it alot and we all love the way she smells.,5
13179,"This waterpik is great. It is a little sloppy, but what wouldn't be squirting water into your mouth?
It was worth the price.",4
13180,"Very nice and healthy, unfortunately without some additional odor (per example with help of some natural herbs) to improve the complete impression...",4
13181,Ok but wish it would heat up more. Will do until I find a better one,3
13182,"Smells a bit like baby powder to me. Fresh, but not what I expected.",3
13183,Should have actually smelled it before relying on others opinions.  Too sweet and flowery for my taste,2
13184,"ran out of product after only 3 weeks of use.  a little bit goes a long way, but there's not enough of it.",3
13185,I guess I was hoping this would help my gums NOT!!!,3
13186,Its a good beginners kit. Good quality but only comes with 20 tips.,4
13187,I would start with using this cream once a day. it does an excellent job drying out acne but that means dry skin and flaky make up,3
13188,I love the style but I just used 2 times and tear apart,1
13189,"This product is supposed to be odorless, however it isn't.  I has a bad perfume smell.  I won't ever use it again.",1
13190,the blades are awesome but the handle is eh. its noce but it is something i could find on any other razor at this price.,4
13191,I love all Crew products so it was no surprise when I tried this for the first time and it was excellent. Never felt cleaner.,4
13192,very nice pendandt its just the spring in the chain was a little flimsy but over all great :) i really injoyed this,4
13193,Gorgeous color! I am so happy I got this!,5
13194,iam fan of levender. thanks for the good bubble bath. it is in a good bottle & easy to use,3
13195,Did not like this at all. I went back to regular shave gels like Nivea. I use the Braun Series 7 razor.,1
13196,Its a very large size you won't find in retail stores.,5
13197,Cleanses face really well and get rid of dark spots but doesnt prevent breakouts,3
13198,I have been wearing Shalimar for 50 years. This did not smell like Shalimar.,1
13199,Love it !!!! It actually came early!,5
13200,Love the light smell and protection of my aura and space,5
13201,"One year ownership, used five times according to instructions, and the plastic covering melted to itself. Pulling it apart tore a hole in the covering.",1
13202,The bag is very small much smaller than it looks I wish it came in bigger sizes it would be perfect,2
13203,"the scents are too strong, the substance is fine but the strength was over the top",2
13204,"This is a good brush.  The bristles, handle and head of the brush are all a perfect size.",4
13205,Good follow up to brushing and flossing. Really irrigates gum line and great for flushing under bridges and around crowns,4
13206,Does what it says looks nice it is a tight fit for the art of shaving brushes does what it says great price,4
13207,"very runny, hard to open and use without making a mess, could never bring this to the gym, I am a bed head guy",2
13208,I haven't seen a huge difference but I like the way it makes my skin feel after I use it.,4
13209,Not what I wanted. Wanted REACH Ultraclean. Lot #0619D  14:40.  Only think that works for my teeth with caps. HELP,2
13210,"Made my hair brittle and dull looking, didn't do anything for the itch or dandruff.",1
13211,"Great product! I personally would like a little less scent, even though its wonderful, just a little too pungent for my use.",4
13212,My laziness cost me some bucks. Walmart has the larger size for the same price. Stupid choice on my part.,1
13213,"This Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser, works very well, I like it. I use it every day to clean my teeth.",4
13214,Love this pic! Works extremely well and helps my receding gum lines!,5
13215,"Not the color I was exepecting, I guess you could say its a light shade of velvet red. But I still like it.",4
13216,"For a Philips Norelco product, it was only so-so.  I subsequently bought a Wahl product and found it to be much better.",2
13217,Gave this as a gift and the recipient loved it!,5
13218,"Melting fast, and water together, no allergies,  to use up the amount to be doubled,So I gave 4 stars.",4
13219,Don't use frequently but it definitely keeps my hair moisturized.,3
13220,"Difficult to apply, it might work but it will take time. How long? One moth, at least. But I am not there yet.",3
13221,No matter what I do these will let UV light through the corners. They also don't sit flat or fit on my eyes.,1
13222,Its not really necessary if you're using the shower conditioner.,3
13223,I only received the nipple covers. I was extremely disappointed with this purchase.,1
13224,Not all the colors work on dark color s fast s,3
13225,"It's fairly sharp, but may not be as sharp as necessary for my fine hair.",3
13226,Great stuff but price continues to rise...may as well pay my hairstylist for a dye job,4
13227,I love everything with menthol but I expected this body wash to have a stronger smell of menthol.,3
13228,One of the pumps' came with plastic that looked like it had melted and then dried. It was unusable. And they weren't foaming pumps!,1
13229,They do what they're supposed to I guess. Comfy.,4
13230,These super sunnies are so tight and small  . I do not care what you do to make them fit ..they do not. I was very dissatisfied.,2
13231,The floss is just the right thickness so it works very well.,5
13232,"Takes up too much room and it's very noisy.
It is not forceful enough to remove food in between your teeth.",3
13233,Lasted three months.  The stop flow button got stuck and blocked the water flow.  Pretty disappointing.,2
13234,Not water proof. Trimmer not adjustable. Wound up throwing away,2
13235,"Works as it should. I've only had it for a week though, anything changes and I'll update my review.",4
13236,No real instructions packaging a bit hard to read/see what's happening in the photo.,4
13237,This really does a great job of exfoliating and leaves your skin with a wonderful glow. I love it!,5
13238,"The caps are way too big for a
Med to small size head",3
13239,"Great smell, didn't do anything for my blackheads sadly.",2
13240,"I haven't tried them on yet, but they appear to be decent quality!",5
13241,"It does what it's supposed to. I like that it can used cordless, but I prefer it plugged in.",4
13242,Ordered what was supposed to be the 90 day supply which is 3 bottles and I only got one,1
13243,this is ok - doesn't put off near as much vapor as what I would like - I have another brand that is much better,2
13244,"Pretty,  came 5 days late,but nice two purple three silver.",4
13245,"Very hard to clean. One or two did break. Some of the brushes I did enjoy, but you get what you pay for.",3
13246,It didn't stop my facial sweating but it slowed it down.,3
13247,"This is not Botox but for 15 bucks, it does brighten my face and soften wrinkles. I'll always use this in my daily regimen.",4
13248,"Good for cold-cracked fingertips. Greasy, but it works!",4
13249,"luv the smell, a little light but def Sandalwood - heavenly scent",4
13250,Being using this product for 10 years now and still love it!,4
13251,"From the pictures, my wife thought the brushes would have been more fine. I guess they were rougher than expected. She uses them though.",3
13252,I did not notice any difference in the shine or gloss of my hair. For me this was a waste of money.,2
13253,fits well and does not move out of place while running or playing soccer,4
13254,"Needs a little wax especially if your teeth are close together, plus it is not as wide as I thought it would be.",3
13255,"it is not that what I was expected. particularly for the neck.......
all philips made in Holland whereas this item made in china...",2
13256,I just got it today and I like it so far,4
13257,"I like how it feels on my face. Not greasy but moisturized. Don't expect miracles, nothing reveraes aging.",4
13258,"Nice companion to the razor and brush, wish they would offer a set rather than having to order separately.",4
13259,"I use it every night and it makes my mouth and teeth feel cleaner than just brushing.
should have bought it sooner.",4
13260,"This over heated after a few times of use.  Also, it made my hair greasy!",1
13261,This was a joke! Completely ridiculous! Don't waste your money!,1
13262,It's a lifesaver in between hair appointments. I recommended it to a lot of my friends with gray hair and they also love it.,5
13263,Very nice. The base can also be used as a trash bucket if you put a bag in it!,4
13264,"Not only did it take a long period of time to arrive, it literally broke within 3 hours of wearing it.",1
13265,"This is kind of messy and my wig still lifted
Dont grab if you are going to sweat or get in water",3
13266,Brushes are good but a little stiff but they are good,3
13267,I've only had it for 30 days. Too early to tell.,3
13268,"Okay nail brush, but the bristles fall out constantly. At this rate it won't last long.",3
13269,"This hot brush gives the most wattage and dries my hair quickly wit the amount of curl, straightness and volume I want.",4
13270,Try tea tree oil instead of this. I would say it works better. This dries out the skin way too much,3
13271,"Does not stay in place it come off not worth spending the money, do not recommend it I will try other brands.",1
13272,well it serves its purpose the string elastic keeps untying itself weird,3
13273,Very nice razor stand. It is not rusting and has been a great addition to my shaving gear.,4
13274,I really liked the hair clip.  The only thing that I dislike is that the teeth of the comb do not fit together snugly.,4
13275,"The cream is great and effective on dry skin. Would like to see it available in a larger container.
Very pleasing scent.",4
13276,"Does your makeup stay? Yes
Are u still going to be a grease ball? Absolutely",2
13277,The cream wax is not very good but the rest of the package is great.,3
13278,"Love these. It took me a minute to figure out how to use the wand. BUt now, super happy with the results!",5
13279,Wonderful product and appreciate the extra thought put into including a marker!,5
13280,Seems like it's just Vaseline. Way too expensive. I could buy Vaseline for half the price.,4
13281,My 92 year old father seems to have no trouble operating it.  And he says he likes it.  It's a winner.,4
13282,The case is extremely and doesn't have many pearls in it.,1
13283,I have had a beard for 30 years and have purchased my share of trimmers. So far this has really impressed me. Hope it holds up!,4
13284,Love this serum. Doesn't leave a sticky feel on your skin.,5
13285,"They seem too cheap, they break. Don't like them.",1
13286,Works but required several washing before I could wear it. Material is much to scratchy. Wish it was a little softer.,3
13287,bought this to go with razor  it was recommended to go with razor  won't fit doesn't go with it  waste of time,1
13288,"Creamy, works well alone or with the Wine E.l.f. liner.",4
13289,This definitely works...just a matter of remembering to wear every night.,4
13290,I Really Like These Glitters But They Are Hard To Put On. Also It Comes In A Pretty Small Container.,4
13291,"so far so good as it seems to clean where my electric brush can't,  Time will tell more,",4
13292,"Lovely color.
It just takes forever to come off and leaves a left over tinted red.",3
13293,The price was right and I could not find this size available locally.  Will order again from this site if need arises.,4
13294,"The charge on this shaver holds long enough.  However, the shave isn't close.  Cleaning is very simple though",3
13295,"amazing, used the night before, the cracks are disappeared and my feet feel great, they are fully moisturized and hydrated",5
13296,I wish the effect lasted longer.  But it does work great for a limited time frame.,3
13297,"This is not the same as the one as I got from Ulta. So disappointed. Also, it has too much sparkle in it.",1
13298,I guess the one and a half inch barrel is meant for longer hair than mine.,3
13299,I'm happy with the product.  Will but it again.,4
13300,"Worked well for a long time, but the battery died out quickly. I got a Panasonic and so far it lasts much longer",3
13301,This is for styling. It does blow but not really for a dryer.,4
13302,A tad smaller than I expected but I pr obably didn't pay attention to the size when I ordered them. It gets the job done though.,4
13303,"Just a cover up...doesn't last longer than a few hours...sorry, I don't recommend...",1
13304,It's okay I thought it was extra special bc a celebrity recommended it. It was not.,3
13305,Ok.  Thought would be cute. Arrived in pieces.  Fixed and now wearable.  It's ok product for price.  Unsure if purchase again.,3
13306,"This is not the same as the pictures,very unhappy",1
13307,"I bought this as a travel hairdryer, but even at 1.5 lbs, it's too heavy. Will be returning.",3
13308,"Really like this trimmer - it's easy to adjust, collects all of the hair cuttings, and is easy to clean.",4
13309,Does not work  well and the cord is  only 3 feet long.  I through it away.  Should of sent it back.,1
13310,"Leaves my skin so soft. Still waiting for pores to look smaller, but have only been using the product for a week.",4
13311,Gave me an unintended chemical peel on my face. Skin scorched and painful. Weeks for peeling to stop.,1
13312,It is difficult to discern the exact shade when buying online.  It was pretty close.,4
13313,"I thought it was going to be a soft pink, turned out to be a weird silvery sort thing. Will not be buying again",3
13314,"This makeup covers so well, and the eyeshadow is amazing!",5
13315,"THIS KIND OF SHAVER IS VERY GREAT TO USE. I USE IT EVERY MORNING. It give me a bright face, SO I recommend it.",4
13316,"This black comb, broke the very first time I put it in my hair ,four teeth came out in one shot, Then it was garbage.",2
13317,It's very heavy for my hair.  Felt very waxy.  Didn't like.,2
13318,Ok. Hair quality is great! Color is perfect! But the tape is horrible! Fell out in one day! Disappointing,3
13319,My wife has been using this non stop. She likes it so i'm assuming I did good. Hopefully this helps the rest of yall,5
13320,These combs were much larger than I envisioned them.  I was very surprised by their size. The picture and description was deceiving,3
13321,"seems new. Pretty color. Only thing I noticed was that the blush was really powdery compared to my other Nars blushes, otherwise good.",3
13322,"Good serum, does not clog my pores, a little goes a long way.",4
13323,I had this before and then I moved to a new location so I bought it again. The quality stays the same. Nothing to complain,5
13324,Package was old and ripped. Will not be trying them,1
13325,"work great for salves. Melt down easily, good quality and great price",5
13326,Smells great!  You think you're in an evergreen forest at bath time.,5
13327,The shape and weight of this product is perfect.  Nice and close for those private areas.  Well worth the purchase.,4
13328,I have had better ones but this gets the job done,4
13329,They're ok I guess. No complaints. They keep your cards clean haha,4
13330,Does what I expected and satisfied. One issue with filling up with water. Have to use a cup to fill water reservoir.,4
13331,Coverage is good and it helps to last the lipstick longer on lips. Love it!,5
13332,Use this all the time - wonderful for dry skin and keeping parts of the body moist. I was recommended to it by my Doctor (ENT),5
13333,AAAA++++ does exactly as advertised love it love it love it... would recommend to anyone light and handy AAA+++ love it,5
13334,Was wanting hot air brush. Doesn't give curl like I expected.,2
13335,My husband uses this. I wish it was 100% cruelty free though. they still test on animals.,4
13336,"looks like paint on my scalp, very obvious, & I have a thick head of hair, wouldn't buy again",2
13337,"The string adjuster is a little weird, but the overall quality of the piece is good. I would recommend it.",4
13338,"Beautiful and functions as described, but it is not very light, too bulky and too heavy for travel, great home use.",4
13339,this product does an excellent cleaning job without leaving any residue behind and leaves the eyelids with a refreshing feeling,5
13340,"As a bar shampoo user, I have never had my hair feel this awful. Feels like a broom....will not use again",1
13341,Nice product with good healing properties. Got my itchy scalp cured in 1 week.,5
13342,"It is a poor quality product.
 It stopped working after 3 months of little use.
I'm very desapointed and upset.",1
13343,"Perfect except for 2 had crooked stones.
(Potleaf and Steel Ball not included)",4
13344,Suction is very poor when used with my hygeia pump. Milk output was less than half of my normal output.,1
13345,"Great spa pillow, suction cups works well, stays put. Fit my smaller tub perfectly.",4
13346,as previously reported there is a mold problem with the WaterPik Flosser and I did have mouth sores which I believe  came from this product,1
13347,The base unit is too light and moves around when you try to use the pic.  Otherwise it does the job well.  Inexpensive but good.,4
13348,The heated mitts met all of my expectations. I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a good product to warm your hands at home.,5
13349,"The advertisement said 6 shaving heads, but the box I received had only 3 shaving heads!

Richard Cooney
Salem, NH",1
13350,I'm not getting all the hype.  Maybe I'll try it longer and edit my review in the future.,3
13351,Burned out too soon during 3 months or regular use on a light up mirror. I recommend getting and LED version of this style.,2
13352,First 2 boxes very sharp close shave right after 3 box every blade is not sharp cut ur skin and no close shave.,2
13353,I love this i used to need 3 razors to shave now i only need the one saving time and money and i can dry shave without irritation,5
13354,"I've used this all over my body. I just love it, especially after I shave my legs.",5
13355,Don't apply too much(causes weird texture) and this lipstick is the best.,4
13356,Thick! Smells strongly of vanilla. One of my favorites!,5
13357,"Does what it should, doesn't leak, well put together, seems a bit smaller than I expected. Overall a good buy",4
13358,Terrible it did damage after 2 weeks...did repair...but not...garbage product. it did work nice at first.,1
13359,Too thin the gauge that is. Not what I expected.,1
13360,I love this little machine and these rollers work just fine. No more dead skin on my feet any more.,5
13361,"Go ahead and buy this, it is perfectly suited for cleaning up that area. you get a really close shave and therefor no skin irritations!",5
13362,this is very very small!  Good assortment for the price but the entire container is much smaller than expected.,3
13363,The I Love it statement is overused and overvalued.  Love people and use things.,4
13364,"very nice quality, but not tall enough for my brush",4
13365,burns your skin but nothing can replace a clean diet and weight training program,3
13366,This is nice but I had to use a lot and it didn't last long. I also realized that I like roses but not THAT much.,3
13367,Leaves sticky weird feel on hands and shaver but works!!!!!!!!!!!!,4
13368,Not a huge fan. Didn't make much difference for my skin issues.,3
13369,myriad of colors and very cool and convenient case. they are difficult to put on by yourself but i did purchase the pen set to put on.,5
13370,"Not bad, not a perfect tool but pretty good for the price.",4
13371,"The oil is good, but my quality seal was dislodged and it was leaking in the bag when I received it.",4
13372,I liked the product a lot and felt that it was reasonably priced.,4
13373,"Costly and did not get much flavor from this product.  Perhaps, I expected too much.",3
13374,Good value for the money. The only negative comment I have is that it runs out of water very fast..,4
13375,I love this make up so much. It is the perfect addition for people who get a lot of sun.,5
13376,"I find that Dr. Bronners lathers easier with less.  The scent is pleasing enough, though.  I would not purchase again.",2
13377,"Not so many strips for the money, but they work adequately.",3
13378,Vacuum works well but not as good as i thought. Still an awesome trimmer!!!,4
13379,It's a cute little toilet paper holder. Fits right between my toilet and wall. Just right for what I needed,3
13380,absorbs quickly.  a little goes a long way.  very moisturizing without being greasy,5
13381,Worst razor ever. I lost a lot of blood.,1
13382,use for Scale Model Car Pin striping seems to hold good I know it looks good,5
13383,It wasn't what I expected or what I wanted. My fault or theirs?,2
13384,I have been using Estee Lauder Resilience Lift Night for a year or two now and it is a great product!,5
13385,Stuff was rock hard! Fell out of tube like a piece of plastic.,1
13386,Really for sad run small. Couldn't even zip up the dress In the back. Material was not polyester. A waste of money.,1
13387,Had to return. It didn't fit the harrys razor. Great quality though.,2
13388,"This is the fifth Waterpik I purchased. I think the quality getting worse. The noise is so loud, my ears cannot stand.",1
13389,I would recommend this product to anyone  who love garlic and onions. It will freshen their breath. much like breath-a-sure.,5
13390,"You get what you pay for, It was decent, I have nothing bad to say about it.",4
13391,"not super long lasting, but other than that very good product.",4
13392,HORRIBLE PRODUCT!! SMELL IS HORRIFIC LIKE PLASTIC..BOTTLE CAME DAMAGED AND GAVE NY BABY A RASH. DESERVES NO STARS.,1
13393,"Please disregard my last statement, I found the Aquaphpor. Thank you.",3
13394,"Yeah thanks, they arrived earlier than I thought it would. I love them they look great on my nails",4
13395,Made my razor run like new.  Have owned Norelco shavers for over 40 years.  (Have owned several in that time)  They are very durable.,5
13396,Sharp blades (not as sharp as feather blades) that provide a good shave.,4
13397,"OK, so I feel a little picky when I use it. But if this is a bad product, I'm all wet!!!",4
13398,"Fragrance free and leaves skin super soft, really love on days my skin is dry & irritated.",4
13399,I like this product it will help to get rid of blemishes quicker! It helped me get rid of one quicker!  Would buy it again,4
13400,it is a bit smaller than expected but it has held up so far for school.,4
13401,"Because I was looking for shine and felt it worked moderately well, four stars.  The feel and scent are top notch.",4
13402,"very happy with the Waterpik water flosser, Works as advertised. Have used it for several months and am completely satisfied.",4
13403,Uncomfortable for me...don't know about others but I don't think I'll buy anymore,1
13404,The elastic around it is uncomfortable so I have to wear it inside out,3
13405,Not a Sharp as expected. Expect to use multiple blades when shaving coarse beards.,3
13406,Obsessed with the purple! So sad they discontinued the colour!,5
13407,This is the best.  It hides dark circles and blends in easily.,5
13408,"Disappointing. I have mixed feelings about Honest products these days, but prefer their bottom wash to this.",2
13409,"The description said ""pack of 6"" and I only received 1 pack ! Complete rip-off.",1
13410,I am so glad I trusted  the reviews. I have been tanning for awhile and just love this lotion.,4
13411,It was very confusing trying to figure what goes where! maybe a pic should come with it so you can see how it should be worn..,3
13412,I absolutely love this product! I wish I stockpiled it!,5
13413,doesn't work..facial sweat still pouring out even without makeup!,1
13414,"very small, very ugly , doesn't look at all like the picture, don't buy, period!!",1
13415,Love it!!! There is no burning feeling but your mouth still feels clean and fresh and has the protection of flouride!,5
13416,Fine for a gym bag or travel kit but not a good blow drying brush. It is mid size and comfortable to grip.,3
13417,I have been taking Toji for 2 months and I see less hair fall out and a few baby hairs growing along the hair line.,4
13418,Got this as a gift from my husband last year and I really like it a lot.,5
13419,Not in lI've with all the colors but I will gift them to others.,2
13420,"easy to use, works as promised.. love the idea that it sanitizes the toothbrush heads. can put in different size heads and several things at a time",5
13421,"My 2 yr old loved it but it only lasted 2 weeks. The colors aren't working anymore, just the white light.",1
13422,Says made by Derby. That is hard to believe. These are way better than the regular Derby blades.,4
13423,It look a long time but came well package. Some stone came out the box but it was ok. I guess.,4
13424,"I like the way these shields work however, they did not work well for my underarm perspiration problem.  Also, tended to move around.",1
13425,I've been using it faithfully for 6 weeks.  No sign of lash growth.  Don't waste your $$$!,1
13426,Phew! not sure if it works since I only used it once. Very strong odor for my liking...,1
13427,Not worth it... It's not a spray bottle. Sad part: I can't return it.,1
13428,"I have fine colored hair and have tried just about every product on the market.  I have found this product to ""tame the tiger""!",4
13429,Love this product!  Still going strong after all these years!,5
13430,Product seems to be ok.  Takes time to see if results are as predicted.,3
13431,Very comfortable for clients. Didnt love that it has Ink Bed stamped on the headrest & the arms but still well worth the money.,5
13432,Was a Christmas presant for my wife so i don't know about price but shes happy so im happy! (And still alive),5
13433,Definitely NOT 3000 in them. Very disappointed. The container that they come in is way better than the round ones though.,2
13434,"Like the subtle scent and no greasy feel. As for 24 hours, who knows. Feels good when I apply  it!",4
13435,Does not come with an a/c adapter and the batteries do not last more than 1 or 2 days tops. Definitely looks cool though.,2
13436,"These are very awkward to put in your hair, plus the band came loose from the silver.",1
13437,My dental assistant says that my gums are in much better shape since I started using this.,5
13438,Very disappointed! Need to look into returning this item. Motor is very weak!,1
13439,does not work at all. it does not fit and can not have any affect. it is like a mere accessory.,1
13440,"It was really cheap and when I got it, it was cheap for obvious reasons. It seemed very ""plastic-like"" and small.",2
13441,Did not last long 3 months then quit would not buy again!!!! Steer clear of this one!,1
13442,I don't see a difference in shininess or texture but smells good,3
13443,This was a gift to someone who could not find this scent on QVC so she was very glad to get it,5
13444,"It fits, unfortunately my problem is the shaver is dying not clogged shaver blades. So I have purchased a new razor.",4
13445,Awesome gift! The teacher loved the bag. Very nice and sturdy.,5
13446,"I believe this gives me nightmares.  I only took 1 a day, not 2 like the bottle says.  Start slowly with it.  Disappointed.",3
13447,"I bought this as a gift for my BF, and he likes it a lot.:)",5
13448,They were beautiful and everyone of them was perfect no missing peices or anything. A few repeat colors but for that price you can't beat it.,5
13449,"Love the feel of this toothbrush, the tooth paste also is great leaves your mouth feeling fresh.",4
13450,"Subjective happiness... a mist of love ""in yer face.""",4
13451,with other oral-b toothbrushes i have no problem. but the brush bristles keep falling off and stuck in my braces.,2
13452,Fantastic price on a great toy. Everyone should own one.,5
13453,Works great but don't like the smell. Could've been better.,4
13454,Clips are extremely tight and small. Very hard to get them to open.,2
13455,A completely different brand was delivered. Not even to be intended for skin use.,1
13456,"Shaver is too noisy. It took an inordinate amount of time to get the right shaving position, especially under the chin.",3
13457,The container is much smaller than I expected but it's worth it for the price.  I haven't used them yet but I can't wait.,4
13458,Not real crazy about this product.  If you spray too much your hair looks greasy.  Haven't really noticed any difference in the grey color.,3
13459,It's OK.  Comparable to other products on the market.,3
13460,This has by far the best product after getting your tattoos done. Make sure you order it before you get your tattoo. It smells nice too!,5
13461,I haven't noticed it having any effect on my sweat,3
13462,I have had this for a month now and am very satisfied with this one.  it is better than my old Norelco foil.,4
13463,It's a junk. All the hair stick to the cape even I already patted so hard.,1
13464,Works great with my razor and brush.  Very sturdy and well-balanced.,4
13465,I receive the item dammage and no answer to my mails! I really doesn't recommand American RX.VERY BAD SELLERS!!!!!!!,1
13466,"Very good product, eliminates air born odor almost immediately. In a pinch you can use it in the Stoma bag.",4
13467,this really works .I work in a hot warehouse and I stay pretty dry,4
13468,Put in trash. Was like using magic marker on my lips.,1
13469,Brushes are lovely and pink case is compact.  Smell of chemicals very strong.  Hoping it weakens before holiday giving time!,3
13470,"Very good chrome plated finish and size, but the weighted base is not heavy enough.",4
13471,"This product will stain your teeth a horrible brown colour! I thought I had some sort of disease, but nope -- just Crest!",1
13472,The lens fell out of these the second time I used them. Trash. Don't buy.,1
13473,Very cute for the price. Nice on the go brushes. Not very long. Have shedded some.,3
13474,"Works great, Delivered on time.  Remember you only get one set on googles for the price, even though several are pictured together.",4
13475,I am sorry I bought this product. Takes 15 minutes to heat up. Who has that kind of time? Save your money.,1
13476,Its nice but the pocket ripped after 2days. But other than that it was okay its really light and comfortable,2
13477,Ordered sometime ago as a back up! Dropped the other one I had used for 4 years! Love this blow brush!,5
13478,"Great brush/razor stand.  High quality, fits perfectly in my medicine cabinet.  Highly recommended.",5
13479,Found this much more helpful than spray cleaning. Just let items soak for an hour or so and your done.,5
13480,"Shipping took awhile, the chains are long but you can ajest them to your liking. I can work with this. Worth the money to buy",4
13481,"I was expecting a spray bottle, that's not what I received.  Now I have to spend additional money on a spray bottle.",4
13482,"It's awesome, my daughter has braces and it works wonders for those hard to reach places!!",4
13483,I didn't really think this could do as much as it does for your cuticles. just drip around your nails and rub it in and does wonders,5
13484,Have the impression it was uv gel....it's just glitter....very very disappointed.,1
13485,It's useful as an insert. As my bag is big and I wished the bag has 2 more inches on the length.,4
13486,Williams Lectric Shave helps make your whiskers stand up and makes shaving with an electric shaver all the more effective.,4
13487,I really like the water oil.  The only thing I would change is the storage lid needs to at least hold everything that comes with it.,4
13488,"Only used twice, so far. Will revisit in 2 months",4
13489,Brush and use the water pic.  Best combination to save your teeth.  Still working after one full year.,5
13490,Received item with small hole in foil. My husband almost sliced his face. :(,1
13491,I was looking for 'daylight' type like and this bulb does not provide it. For that reason I would not recommend this product.,1
13492,Awesome brush quality for the price. Ia considering buying more. They are very comparable to sigma brushes.,5
13493,This is my second month in using Toji Density. I have observed some growth and waiting to see more growth in the months to come.,4
13494,"I use this product because there is no other one availible, but it still has to much perfume in it!",2
13495,"Product itself is great, however the seller sold me a product that was a year expired.
Unfortunately the product appears not to be effective.",1
13496,This toothbrush is very gentle on my teeth and gums which usually bleed with even a super soft bristle.,4
13497,"It works fine, but with the cost why not save $150 and get a shaver that also works fine. This shaver is nothing special.",3
13498,Love the light scent and the way it makes my skin feel.,4
13499,Very good product. It's design is great to help get between the teeth.,5
13500,Would have liked it to be a bit sharper. Have to make too many passes to get a clean shave.,3
13501,Dentist recommended this item.  He has one and loves it.  Looking forward to better dental check ups. will be ordering replacement parts as needed.,5
13502,Arrived cracked and with debris in the hole.  Item is too small and too thick for proper gua sha technique.,1
13503,i like it its useful and  it helps your teeth  i just do not use it frequently  and shipping was fast,4
13504,Awful. Flimsy and not really reusable. Hair does NOT collect as you would think because of poor design. Skip it,1
13505,"Better than expected.  Easy to operate, convenient to store, many different uses ....including a tooth brush!",5
13506,"string doesn't stay attached very well, but overall a good product",4
13507,I was extremely pleased after trying a sample of this bodywash. It has a really pleasant scent and left my skin feeling very refreshed and smooth.,4
13508,I must say I always wanted one and finally got one and  love it,5
13509,Love it ! Made a huge difference the first night I wore it . Wish it was bigger but love it!,4
13510,I have a larger hot air brush that I purchased locally. This one doesn't get as hot.,4
13511,Good product . I have used before with a spray...this works well and covers,4
13512,I love the smell of this product. I also bought the body butter and that smells great as well. I will be buying these again,5
13513,"Seems to stick and come apart, but it does the job fairly well",3
13514,It was too stretchy and didn't align the toes  sorry to say!,1
13515,Scrub is coming off from the holder within a week of use. Its not good for regular and long use.,2
13516,I am not happy with this product at all. The chin strap slips and is very flimsy. I expected a better product for my money.,2
13517,"Love this serum! Worth every penny, it has only been a few weeks and I can see a difference!!",5
13518,This was recommended by my mother a few years ago to ward off pesky mosquitoes. I have been using ever sense and have remained bite free.,5
13519,I am very dissapointed in this. It smells so good at first but the smell goes completely away after 5 mionutes.,1
13520,It took 1 wash for the hair to turn into a ratted mess. Will never order again! Waste,1
13521,"I thought this color would be a little greener based on the picture, but it turned out much more blue. It's still really pretty though.",4
13522,Works better than any other non-traditional shampoo alternative I've tried.,4
13523,"Loved it, the only problem was one of the blushes broke during shipment",4
13524,As soon as I got them the eye gear fell out.,1
13525,Love these shadows! The colors are sexy and perfect for a night out! Quality is really good for the price!,4
13526,"Mustaches are kind of cheap, but so is the price. Definite buy for a mustache party though",4
13527,"Messy, just go to the Salon and have a professional do it.",2
13528,Good shaving system. Results in a clean smooth shave. Probably somewhat over priced but all in all a good shaver.,4
13529,My Dermatologist recommended the Olay purple pump to help ameliorate my dry skin.  It works better than most other skin conditioners I have used.,4
13530,"This Item is almost very good ,only thing I want to say is that the speed is a bit slow. Otherwise it's pretty good",4
13531,I really liked this.  I am going to be trying all their products when my other stuff runs out!,4
13532,i liked it but the ball came off while i was sleeping a few weeks after i got it ...,2
13533,I was surprised to see how easy they were to use.  I think I have noticed a difference already in the whiteness of my teeth.,4
13534,It had very low power!  Wimpy!  Sent it back.,2
13535,very pretty and goes well with my light blue bathroom color,5
13536,Not reversed polarity as stated. Needed a longer pos. Connection. Great value compared to others.,3
13537,Not bad for the price. Hoping it doesn't tear.  So far so good.,4
13538,it works and I feel my teeth  cleaner than ever. Not a complicate machine to use. I would recommend this product to everyone.,5
13539,"There was no heat or power to this ""hair drier"". Don't waste your money",1
13540,"Took the whole bottle to notice improvement, but will give it a further try",3
13541,Color was not sand beige. It was orange beige. I didn't open it. Had to return it.,1
13542,Shipped fast and product was the quality as described. Would recommend highly recommend for any one looking to open a shop or salon.,4
13543,I ordered 2 sets neither came with the pink bag and the brissels on the brushes are hard.,1
13544,Cute and sexy! Use it to embellish your wardrobe!,4
13545,This product is very nice especially if you have spicy foods. Just pop a couple capsules and let them do the work,4
13546,"Not only does it not work, but it does leave residue in your clothing, not to mention a big mess on hands after application.",1
13547,Cleans well. Strong smell and a little harsh on sensitive skin if not rinsed immediately.,4
13548,The lid of the cointainer easily breaks but the product is amazing.,4
13549,I think I like this product.  Actually I can't tell that I am taking them but will continue to do so.,4
13550,"if you have a soft skin like i do this is not for you. look at the picture titled ""it's burning""",1
13551,Not to impressed with product but did arrive as it was described .,3
13552,trimmer was not the same model as pictured.  even though I will use it; I was misled.it was not as listed.,2
13553,"It works, but not as well as my original one.  This is often hard to insert and remove the tips for some reason.",3
13554,GORGEOUS! Great pigment. Will buy again. Highly recommend.,5

13556,Mi wife says that her skin feel better when using this product.,4
13557,"a bit noisy and vibrates. Depending upon your water hardness, it must be cleaned regularly. Wish there was an attachment for cleaning ear wax.",4
13558,"It works well! A little bulky but the storage of the supply line is a good improvement on previous models.
No regrets!",4
13559,"The packet arrived crushed, the bottle was a bit open and the product has a slightly sunk...
So I was disappointed....",3
13560,The product does what its suppose to do. EXCEPT when it gets less than half way filled the foundation becomes harder to dispense from the pump.,4
13561,"Wish product came with more detailed instructions.  Besides that product performed exactly how it was described, happy with my purchase.",4
13562,This insert allows you to organize your purse and keep everything in sight.  Works well in large bags and doesn't get lost among the clutter.,4
13563,I put in batteries and it doesn't turn on...,1
13564,Stays on forever but it foes dry your lips out.u have to put a ChapStick on over it,4
13565,"These are my favorite blades, though that's a personal opinion.",5
13566,Not like the bigger bars. For some reason they smell different. It was ok. Not what I wanted. It wasn't bad.,3
13567,I didn't really notice a difference but change of poo,1
13568,Lousy razors.  I will not order these again.  Not comfortable and got tons of nicks.,1
13569,"Easy to use, easy to clean and does the job. Very happy with the product. I like the compact size as well.",5
13570,I don't really see any difference as far as it helping to spread my toes or ease discomfort of pain in my feet.,1
13571,"Received in good condition. Not loose, ready for instant use. Works well with my razor and brush.",5
13572,They are a bit tricky to put on but they work great.  Very helpful!  And much longer lasting than anything else I have tried.,5
13573,I wanted the extra strength but I received the regular kind. A bit disappointed!!! I just used it anyway.,2
13574,The cutters provided work very well but if one also needs the retainer to hold them in place it is not included with this item.,4
13575,"I have a couple of these razors, they work fine for me. I have even bought replacement blades & screens. Very happy with this razor.",4
13576,Brushes had a horrible plastic smell. Did not want to use them on my skin.,1
13577,This is so easy to apply and it works great in very short time. It is good to have this Gel !,4
13578,The product itself does what it says but unfortunately the smell is bad so I try not to breath when I use it.,2
13579,"Its a very good color on my fair skin. However, at 29, the slight sparkle seems a bit much.",4
13580,"They work great, they are an exact replacement, and they are reasonably priced.  What's not to like?",4
13581,"works well, but you smell like an oilfield worker when don.  Very strong smell like and old time home made cure.",4
13582,Not greasy on face and arms. Does take away chlorine smell.,4
13583,A must have for anyone with braces! My teeth feel like I just had a dental cleaning once I am finished.,5
13584,The lipstick is very soft and actually broken off in the tube.,1
13585,Beautiful colors and they have a nice flow to them as well.,5
13586,These are very good for the price but I prefer the*stainless they are smoother and less irritation.. Try the stainless,3
13587,"Quality of control of container very poor, spray nozzle was not assembled and cover  for top of container is difficult to remove.",3
13588,The scent is way to faint.  The holder is nice though.,2
13589,It lasted less than 2 years. It works great for as long as it works.,3
13590,Good for in between visits to your skin care specialist.,4
13591,"This was ordered for a student art project. Everything came on time and as promised.

Thanks",4
13592,I was disappointed it did not have a digital screen to show how much time I had left to shave.,4
13593,"thick and causes breakouts. i guess it covers blemishes okay, but not as well as expected",2
13594,This works very well.  Recommended by my doctor and keeps my psorious pink instead of red and cracked.,4
13595,I really like it. I wish it was just a little more sturdy. Love the color,5
13596,I was told about this product and it is a very good one,5
13597,"I was really looking forward to trying this product. However, the seal underneath the was already broken.",1
13598,"Really like this spray for between colors, have purchased several of them.",4
13599,too expensive!!!!!!! I found some cheaper and they are actually better tape.,1
13600,i am a very satisfied customer. Thank you for your merchandise.,5
13601,Very lightweight cape - thin material.  Nice Length.  Nnot sure how it will stand up against perms and coloring.,3
13602,I  wonder if this lightly finish coated non hardwood will endure years of moisture and use.  I plan to add an additional protective coating.,3
13603,A really nice gift or travel package.  I adore the smell.,5
13604,"Made issue worse, ended up going to the dentist spending more money. buyers beware!",1
13605,"This product is designed to work only after multiple uses.  If you have a very small area, it might work but not for the whole yard.",2
13606,The only problem I have with this blush is the high cost.,3
13607,good product.only problem it can only be used a few times before runs out.,4
13608,Husband loves these simple shampoo bars. They last forever and take up hardly any space. Very gentle on his scalp.,5
13609,"Nice color, blends easily, a little too light for me.",4
13610,"I love NARS and this is my all-time favorite blush! Orgasm is such a beautiful blush, everyone can wear it!",5
13611,"These shave like industrial razor blades. Better to shell out the extra money for something better, even if it's only a disposable.",1
13612,My product was not sealed and either used or something.. attached are pictures. Would like a refund please.,1
13613,They don't really pick up the rinestones & the rinestones get white if you press the pencil to hard.,1
13614,Awesome quality but too pricey. Beeswax doesnt cost as much when bought locally.,3
13615,It looks nice on the outside but mine came with a brocken lock doesn't work,2
13616,I did NOT get this I got some small nail brushes. Don't buy! It's a waste of money. I should have looked at reviews,1
13617,I ordered this back in March and I still haven't got it very disappointed,1
13618,This was such a disappointment.  The airflow was weak and the brush barely grabbed my hair.,1
13619,This container is inexpensive and does what it is supposed to.  I couldn't ask for more in a product.,4
13620,"This thing sounds like a car in your bathroom, and you have to refill the ""tank"" constantly.  I don't recommend this.",2
13621,Five Stars!!! PERFECT FOR ELECTRIC SHAVER !!!,5
13622,I take these as soon as I feel something like a cold coming on and it works. The trick is to take it early enough.,4
13623,I do not recommend it because it not cut my facial hair at all. I prefer to use shick or mach 3 of gillete,1
13624,Color was a bit lighter than expected so I blended with a slightly darker lip color. Lasted long.  I only reapplied once.,4
13625,Does not catch the hair. There was nothing to like about it. I do not recommend this product to anyone.,1
13626,The axe logo side is a little to rough for me,4
13627,Does the job. Slips out of my hand sometimes.,4
13628,"Great display with a variety of settings. We bought it for a nursery, but this even entertained the adults trying it out!",5
13629,"When used as a wet shaver and with the moisturizing cream, it does a fantastic job. Happily surrendered my razor blades...",5
13630,Great product!!!  Ive I've known before how good this things were I would have buy one a lot of time ago.,5
13631,I've been alternating using this device along with flossing.  It does a good job keeping plaque off my teeth and loosening stuff caught between them.,4
13632,it's a big one!  but very happy with it,4
13633,Glad to have a product to help me maintain  the appearance of my pedicure between periodic trips to the podiatrist,4
13634,Delivery took more than 2 weeks. Absolutely rubbish. Does not work. Save your money do not buy this product. Think I have been conned.,1
13635,"They were cute , but medal is rejected by my piercing so , it goes without saing I can't really wear these much. Nice quality though.",4
13636,Great for a short spike hair style.  Does not leave hair sticky.  Will order again.,4
13637,Eh ... smells a little funky but does a great job detangling :),4
13638,My favorite sleep mask ever. Love it!!!,5
13639,"I use these for shaving. Last me about 4 or 5 shaves. Very simple blades, very easy to use.",5
13640,"so far so good, doesnt shut off in 2 minutes like the POS Vidal Sasoon one I have does",4
13641,I love this dental floss because it just glide in between my teeth.,4
13642,Once I received it with the lip balm it wasn't what I expected once I applied it I noticed it had lumps,1
13643,It did not do clear the fungus and smell too strong.  I did not like it.,2
13644,"It fits well, and is very soft. Styling is required and make sure it does not tangle! It's great for it's price.",4
13645,"I have always used Norelco products, and this one is by far the best shaver I have ever owned!!",5
13646,"Nice, quality item.  There is definitely weight to it and is a legitimate stand and not a cheap object.",4
13647,"Great product, great price!  Pure products are important to me.  I love that this responsibly sourced.  Customer service is good too.",5
13648,"Work exceptionally well. Very sharp, snips hair with ease and fingers as well.",5
13649,This is a fantastic loose eye shadow set! The pigmentation is phenomenal and the color choices are great! I love this set!,5
13650,Just what I needed to use with my diabetes supplies!!,1
13651,I asked for flaxen hair and received light brown which looks dark brown .,1
13652,I dislike everything about this lipstick.. tried to wear it everyday for a week straight and would never stay on my lips.,1
13653,"I yam what I yam! And I yam a tube. I have only 2 holes but they have fittings, Please adapt me.",4
13654,It works okay but left my hair feeling sort of weird. Not as soft as I like my hair too feel.,4
13655,"This is just what my dentist wanted me to use.

Good price but found cheaper in target on sale.
Oh well...should have researched more!",4
13656,Great ways to clean your teeth and your gum. It really helps me clean the area between my teeth and prevent gum diseases.,4
13657,Didn't care for the feel and didn't help much,1
13658,"I works super and so glad it is reusable and washable.  Would highly recommend. Great price for this product too,",5
13659,I found this very rough and uncomfortable to use. I trashed it,1
13660,Smaller than I thought they would be!  If advertised for a gel insert for a bathing suit they should be larger.  They are made nicely though.,3
13661,Smells good. Not sure if it does anything though.,3
13662,Wife loves it. Can't tell when the mask is on or off ;),4
13663,Does the job - my dentist recommended I use one but it is a pain and gets water all over.,3
13664,This is perfect for my skin and I am planning to buy a bunch more. it has now become a necessary item for me :),4
13665,"As I said with the roller, so far so good.  Figured it would take a while to see complete results.",4
13666,This was mythird purchase of this item.  I have been using it for years. Works great on my hair when it is short or growing out.,5
13667,This soap smells great and leaves me feeling soft and smooth. However it does not last long. The bar melts away pretty quickly.,4
13668,Works as expected.  Thetimer keeps the children engaged in making sure they get all their teeth.,4
13669,Items were exactly what I was looking for good quality product arrived as scheduled,5
13670,"Definitely would not buy again, a waste of time....and money.",1
13671,Makes combing a grandchild's hair much less traumatic!!,4
13672,"It did help our gums, but the water pressure became funny then the machine completely stopped working after only 1.5 years of use.",2
13673,"El producto me llego en tiempo y forma, todo bien, estoy dispuesto a comprar nuevamente,completamente satisfecha, se los recomiendo, gracias",5
13674,"It was a darker color than I had originally ordered, but I like it for lips or face.",5
13675,"does what it is supposed to do...good quality, nice design, better than older models..great price it' $14 more at Walmart!",4
13676,The sunnies are way too small for a comfortable fit. The fit should be more like a regular glasses for more comfort.,1
13677,Too big for my fine thin hair.  Did nothing for me except slide right out of my hair with no curl whatsoever.,2
13678,"What can I say? They work, and do the job well.",4
13679,Was ok.  Never got used to it going on wet and then drying.,2
13680,"The diffuser falls off, but otherwise it's a great blowdryer",3
13681,"I do wish it was rechargable instead of battery powered but otherwise it's a good product, trims hair down there no problem.",4
13682,"Did not shave as close as claimed. Returned the product, as advised by seller, to Conair several weeks ago and am still waiting for refund.",2
13683,It's an ok product not worth the money. Less expensive brands are better. Glad I just got the sample will not be buying the product!,3
13684,"This is not what it seem to be on the photo , very much smaller and poor neck tie and velcro work ... disappointing",1
13685,I'm not sure if it's doing anything. I use it as base coat anyway.  It doesn't seem to be making my nails any stronger,3
13686,This is my second groomer.  After a few years the on/off button caved in on the first unit.  No other complaints.  Works great.,4
13687,"This does work in removing hair but the hair grows back quick, just like shaving. It does have a smell when you apply it.",4
13688,Product is what I was looking for in a flosser. I dislike the noisy pump and the wrong power supply voltage.,4
13689,"The product accomolishes with the requirements. The only ""but"" is that the glasses are blurry.",4
13690,It said that it was going to come with vervain but it didn't which made me very disappointed and it had anwhole,2
13691,Love the smell but hate the residue this leaves on my skin. Very uncomfortable.,3
13692,I always prefer to shave with a pre-shave.  The store brands stink - literally.  Lectric Shave smells good.,5
13693,"Just a bit more orange than I expected, but it was the anticipated darkess",4
13694,The Bodygroom Shaver serves the purpose perfectly. It shaves close enough and relieves any concerns about cuts or nicks.,4
13695,"Good smells, feels good, good product. My only warning is that it's on the smaller side as far as quantity goes.",4
13696,Color turned out to be almost totally black.  Nowhere near Medium/Light Brown!!!!,1
13697,I noticed a difference in my gums within a few days. This is a wonderful adjunct to home dental care.,5
13698,This bracelet was super cute but I only wore it once and it broke. I can't expect much for the price but I am still disappointed.,1
13699,The bars are too small and not shaped correctly. Horrible.,3
13700,"this is garbage after a month it has not worked, the claims made are almost fraudulent.",1
13701,"I have hair that grow basically leveled with my skin, making it difficult to pick up with any electric razor. Lectric Shave helps a lot.",5
13702,"The blanket is exactly what I thought it would be, very nice & matches the Cocola bedding set we have.",5
13703,Have never tried Colgate mouthwash but bought it to try and help build back enamel. Taste of mouthwash works fine without being too strong or too weak.,5
13704,a life saver for my favorite polishes that have been around awhile and gotten too thick to brush smoothly.,5
13705,Wax is to stiff it doesn't go on with out pulling,1
13706,"This works very well; a bit noisy, but the flow is good when turned to full capacity.  It does a good job.",4
13707,"Good, safe kit with lots of options. Perfectly smooth with two size options on each piece. Pieces can be sterilized.",4
13708,I don't know what I would do without this formula! I only wish they'd sell individually--flush product and pre-treatment product,3
13709,"The price is great for the blades but they could have been sharper. The blades from Feather are better in quality, in my opinion.",3
13710,Always use this when I shave...everywhere I shave.,5
13711,"Great starter kit!
The wax remover is not the best product
But the rest of the stuff works great",4
13712,What I received was liquid latex but a completely different bottle. Will not order again,2
13713,Great shampoo! My Husband loves it too. Nice smell.,5
13714,These work great but they took so long to get that I forgot I even purchased them.,2
13715,Seller will not stop spamming me for a 5 star review. The product is fine.,1
13716,"Hard to control the spray...comes out too much and too fast. Spray often spittles down onto your face, clothes and surfaces.",2
13717,This is O.K. if you trim the hair first wherever you're shaving.  You can use it in the shower with shaving cream.,3
13718,have used this product for years and this is the only place I could find to purchase.  It just takes a small amount and is very relaxing.,5
13719,"Does the Job, for the price you can't go wrong",3
13720,"Smell is bad, it doesn't work for me.",1
13721,The teeth are too long for short hair.  It wouldn't work on my hair.,2
13722,Bought this for my boyfriend as a gift.  It keeps the soap lint free & looks good on the counter.,5
13723,"Definitely gets the job done, but I wish I would have purchased the block instead of the stick for ease of application.",4
13724,I really like the smell and texture of it. Fast shipping I'm really happy with my purchase ,4
13725,Very dissatisfied. Product was open when I opened the box and product spilled and I was unable to return it.,1
13726,The latch has already broken.  I liked it a lot but it will not hold together now with the broken hook that holds it together.,2
13727,"Insist to use, the effect is very good, big noise, the brush head matching complete, the late high cost of replacement",3
13728,Im seeing results just within a few days. Massage the area in circular motion,4
13729,"do not waiste your money, it does not work, is not reusable. after first use is garbage.
do not buy this",1
13730,"Great,  non-irritating cleanser.  Decongests and calms skin. Improved clarity with a smoother more even complexion.",5
13731,These are overpriced. You can get similar bath tools for less money. I likely won't purchase this product again,2
13732,Way to over priced ..  .5 ounces is very small.. then to top it off . It doesn't do much to your skin.. Rrrrrr!!!!,1
13733,"Over the long run the device should help people with gengivitis. It is easy to use and, so far, it has been sturdy.",4
13734,"do not buy this item for your loubies, not the right shade of red.",3
13735,I have brown hair and it did not cover the grey roots :(,1
13736,Not bright enough or at all like the one that came with my makeup mirror when I received it as a gift.,2
13737,"Great product, FYI if you've never used it, it smells like baby powder.",5
13738,This stuff is nice....but vert very small. .,3
13739,Goods is very good! Easy to full is very poor!,4
13740,"As I said OK for the price, but people outside U.S. should know that it operates on 120 Volts, so have that in mind.",3
13741,Daughter has eczema and allergist suggested this. I like it. Little greasy but sinks right in!,4
13742,best product i've used so far to cover gray - makes your hair feel like its dirty but covers the gray,4
13743,The kit is ok - the wax that comes with it did not work for me.,2
13744,It looks like mostly lard (white greasy stuff) and the shea butter ranges from green to gray. I son't purchase this again.,1
13745,Might just be me but using those waxing stripes are difficult and no hair removal happens. Would not recommend to anyone.,1
13746,"Work just as they should, a good close shave.",4
13747,"100% happy with this purchase. It worked as expected, without issue.",5
13748,The top of the lip tint sometimes comes off and i have to screw it back in.,3
13749,Does what I expected and satisfied. One issue with filling up with water. Have to use a cup to fill water reservoir.,4
13750,it did not stick . it was kind of small. it was waste of money. you should not buy this,2
13751,Nice moisturizer  but didn't really do anything for my scars. Also good to put under foundation,3
13752,Bracelet is more blue than turquoise than I was expecting. I haven't worn it yet it just seems stiff and uncomfortable to wear.,2
13753,As expected.  Packaged well so that product and outer wrapping was not damaged.,5
13754,"it exactly what I was looking for, in the same time I consider it a little expensive.",4
13755,"Good quality, wireless and portable.
Only one option is missing (for me), it cannot operate in euro - A.C.  220 volts standard.",4
13756,This works well and the attachment is very sturdy. I was expecting something with more noise but it barely heard.,4
13757,"Unfortunately it gets extremely hot after running for only a few minutes, to the point of it burning your scalp.",1
13758,"Do not put these In your lip. They are too heavy, nd to big.",3
13759,I love this product I use it about twice a week for about three months. I can see a difference in my skin.,4
13760,A little too strong but nice color after I wipe some off.,4
13761,im sure once i figure out  how the thing works it'll be nice.... definitely not something doable on yourself until you master it.,2
13762,It's a great comb. Much better than your cheap black Combs. I will be ordering a longer one next.,5
13763,I would give it a 4 star if it wasn't twice the price of what the wipes cost in store,2
13764,"Daughter loves it, the brushes, the case and the color.",5
13765,The wig was OK. Worked great for my daughter Halloween Costume and for play. The adjustable band was a big plus,3
13766,I think it works great on everyday bad breath and does a pretty good job combating garlic and onions!  I like that it's all natural.,4
13767,Would of given it 5 if it had more pressure.,4
13768,Got it the other pretty good especially for the price a little smaller then displayed but I'm satisfied for now,3
13769,My kids like to play with the pump.  Try so hard to get them not to waste it.  The kids say it is a good flavor.,3
13770,Probably a good supplement....but not a fountain of youth.....when will I learn?,2
13771,It cut nice but not perfect. It doesn't hurt at all. But not close enough and doesn't catch all hairs.,4
13772,"Got a lot of doubles, they are hard to get off, and the balls are so tiny that it ca barley be seen on my face.",1
13773,This product was not what I expected.  It was a cheap piece of cloth and I would not order it again.,1
13774,Be careful with this one. I had only wore it a few days and it started turning me green,1
13775,Tapes too long and stretchy. Should be made of same tape neck and jaw lifts are.,3
13776,The bar is too long for my ear. It would help to have a shorter option.,3
13777,I seen no results as to all the reviews .Put it on night and day as it says. And I seen no improvement.,1
13778,"not actually a ""brush""  It does not hold my hair well",2
13779,I love how this lightens my freckles. I didn't break out from it ether. It does lighten your skin up but only a little bit,5
13780,"Horrible. Absolutely no rotation on the blade, cut myself repeatedly. I ended up throwing them away. Very sharp thou",1
13781,"The color is not rose tea, is a little girl pink. Didn't like it",1
13782,"Shoots water like it is supposed to do... It's a bit louder than I prefer, but not horribly loud enough to require ear plugs...",4
13783,"A few stones were missing and not too many color variety, but fast shipping",3
13784,it still makes my skin rash and red after applying the product because actually it's not 100% alcohol free. Quite disappoiting.,2
13785,Too small and the elastic would cause the plastic to pressure the eyeballs. I regret buying this.,1
13786,BBS shave with my EJ89!  See ya again in a year after i have used all 100 of the bad boys.,5
13787,"Very cute & girly. You get what you payed for, not amazing, but works for the price. Recommended.",4
13788,I would rather have it spray a consistent steady  water stream. The way it sputters when it sprays makes water go all over place.,2
13789,When i opened the package one of the bottle was open and spilled inside the plastic.,3
13790,"Well made, but too small for my Stirling shaving brush. The brush holder needs to be bigger.",3
13791,"Works well, I miss the charge level light.it is easy to maintain. Will operate with the cord when battery runs out.",4
13792,Have an older one that still works but like it so well thought I would get and extra.  Hope they don't quit making these.,5
13793,"Fast delivery, great product. Used for ppl with retainers or bridges that can't accomodate regular style floss",5
13794,"The vacuum part is a waste of time,there's always hair all over the counter, other than that it's a good trimmer.",3
13795,Wanted something that would just cover my few Greys at my roots/regrowth in between my hair coloring; didn't work for me.,1
13796,This is a good product and I didn't have to use it everyday.  I sprayed on my feet and in my shoes and ...voila!!,4
13797,The Product is excellent but the smell and taste of plastic is offensive to me. Is there a way to rid it of that odor?,4
13798,Only way to get my electric razor totally clean. Works well.,4
13799,This floss breaks much too easily. Will not be purchasing again.,1
13800,"Great price, great delivery, and works much better than my old water pic.",5
13801,Product came on 11/21/15 in excellent condition. It was a purchase for my son and he absolutely love it. Thank you,5
13802,This kit is good but they sent me orange ink instead of black kinda hard to tattoo with just orange ink,2
13803,my question is what is the applicator made of? Hope it is not latex.,2
13804,I likie the glossing cream but the shampoo & conditioner are a little too heavy for my fine hair,4
13805,"I love it!! As soon as I finish this one, will order another one !!",3
13806,When I was married the wife liked it a lot.,3
13807,"Using this at night at bedtime and after a few days my nails are stronger, no icky odor and the bottle will last a long time.",5
13808,really works I like it so much I will most likely buy it again it comes from England you know,4
13809,I don't care for the product.  It does not cover very well/,2
13810,"Produces a thin vapor compared to Essential depot's VG, gonna stick work then on my next order",3
13811,I am so disappointed was looking for a facial system but this is not for me  better luck with something else,1
13812,"Product not greasy and doesn't make my face breakout.  Still looking for a more moisturizing ""gel"".",4
13813,right as i took the eyeshadow brush out it came apart...you definatly get what you pay for,2
13814,Works ok but a lot noisier than my last one which was the same model,2
13815,This lotion doesn't have the same scent as the other olay luscious orchid that I had before I wish I did not buy,1
13816,I ordered this weeks ago and still don't have it so still waiting will write more when get it,3
13817,"We love this cream.  Actually, the most ideal cream we've found is mixing this cream with Aveeno diaper cream... magic!",4
13818,The light scent and no harsh chemicals made this a good choice for a pre-teen boy.  Got good reviews on line.,4
13819,I wanted to love it but it didn't do anything more for my dry skin than anything else has.,3
13820,To light to match! Not good for lily skin.,4
13821,"The lipstick is dry, feels awful on my lips and does not stay on as advertised. I would not recommend this to anyone.",1
13822,Very small sampling.  Love the fragrance of some of the products.  Has a clean orange scent.  Nice size to try the products.,4
13823,I use this to cleanse my hair and it's amazing I just wish it came in a larger container!,4
13824,Works great and yippy don't have to use much to crab brushes,5
13825,not at all hydrating for my skin.  even after a second coat.  :-/  a cream should be hydrating!,2
13826,The flosser works well however there are times that it cuts off. I turn it off and re-start it again and it is fine,4
13827,"Just OK, does not work as well for arthritis as I had hoped.",3
13828,"My boyfriend told me not to buy it, I didn't listen and it ended up breaking the first day I got it without even wearing it.",1
13829,They shrank and are now just a tad small so I probably won't be able to use them.  Wouldn't buy again.,2
13830,Not worth the money. Any panty liner will give you the same effect.,1
13831,Works great. just as advertised.  Wonderful for my kids with sensative skin.,5
13832,"The product I ordered was smaller than what I  was supposed to get, and the product wasn't even the same thing as I have always gotten..",1
13833,"right now i am happy, but i imagine the future will tell the story on how long it will last",4
13834,This is great for use after acid peels. Very smooth and refreshing. highly recommended.,4
13835,"It's floss, it's Glide, it works well. We ordered it because we could not find non-minted floss anywhere for our kids.",4
13836,They arrived in awesome condition! They're so soft and cute and pink and I love them so much !!,5
13837,"Good quality. Sharp, which can lead to easy nicks. Less chance of razor burn. Good blades for intermediate wet-shavers.",4
13838,Wig was beautiful. Fit great. Shipping estimate was a little crazy,5
13839,theyre too harsh but then again it feels good lol except for the scrubbing side thats too extreme,3
13840,"I loved my bridal is a bit large but is very pretty, buy it for use in my wedding and the price is really very nice",4
13841,"I have used this product before and I think it's great, not over powering, I highly recommend this
to the guys...............",4
13842,"JERGENS HAS BEEN MY OLD STAPLE FOR KEEPING MY SKIN SOFT AND MOIST. KEEP IT BY MY BEDSIDE TOO, IT'S GREAT ON THE FEET.",5
13843,"its just a smell good moisturizer, do not see any results of what it claims to do thus far.",2
13844,"Great products, I love the flossing cream. I just wish the bottles had more ounces in them.",4
13845,"If the head is not all the way on it leaks. Also hurt if used with regular tap water, needs warm water.  Otherwise works great.",4
13846,"shaves well--bigest problem with mounting of the cutters, they come off too easily when foil is removed to clean.",3
13847,This is terrible. It barely shaves at all. Not at all what I expected. Hit the trash can in just three months.,1
13848,"This unit does not use lasers, they are red LED lights... It will not work.!!!!",1
13849,Saw on youtube--but it is so light on me it almost does not show at all,3
13850,Took forever to come. But product looks as expected.,3
13851,"product does not stay on for more than a day,  Ok if you just want a really temporary tattoo. nice colors though!",1
13852,This fell apart as soon as it got here....-.- bad buy.. Poorly glued together..,1
13853,Smelled great but badly dried my hair out. No amount of deep conditioning afterwards could control the frizz.,1
13854,"This conditioner is perfect for those who have sensitive scalps and a extremely dry scalp.  The conditioner is all natural, leaves no grease and no frizz.",5
13855,Color was waaaaay off. And it stained my lips terribly.,2
13856,"Hair is very sparse - seriously, don't waste your money.  There are giant ""bald patches."" Sadly, It's not really wearable.",1
13857,Color of dye is not what is on the box. Turns out a nasty old green color.,3
13858,No pain and good suction I would say 3.5 for a low price product,3
13859,Just received this. Have not had enough time to give it a review...,4
13860,These are way small and you can't even see what color they are.,2
13861,"This product arrived quickly, well wrapped and sealed right for safety. The product is top quality as is expect of the brand.",5
13862,"works great, easy to set up/  small but just right to fit  where we need it",5
13863,Still learning how to use it for best results but I really love the brand and have used other products by this company for years  Very happy.,4
13864,Good item. Very handy and easy to use. I like to have a bit heavy one that its perfect weight for me.,4
13865,No seal on bottle. Extremely runny. Like water. Seams tampered with.,1
13866,This renewal cream makes the face seem more hydrated. I like it.,4
13867,"Great latherer, I bought 2. One for home one for travel.",4
13868,"This is a good product. I use this with my girl friend, and she liked it a lot.",4
13869,Ok I guess. The glue was dried out and the acrylic didn't last long. I have cheaper acrylic powder that works so much better.,3
13870,"good for doing nails, quite small and messy tho.  have to be very careful when applying them. I won't be using them much.",3
13871,the brush's hair came out so easily. ( very rough too),2
13872,"We received exactly what we ordered within 3-5 days and it fit into the shaver just perfect.! No problems, completely satisfied!",5
13873,These are really nice!  The only downside is that you are given so little of the smaller rods but it is still a good deal.,4
13874,Very nice product.  Makes a very nice base for applying color.,4
13875,This didn't live up to it's reviews.  Wouldn't recommend buying this item.  Returned the item and had to pay for the return :(,1
13876,These left awful soars on my daughters noise. Way too tight!!,1
13877,We use this to keep our kids lice free as they attend public school and kids there can be pretty nasty.,5
13878,"My favorite lipstick, a beautiful shade.  Lipstick is not greasy or sticky and goes on easily.",5
13879,We are most pleased with our Waterpick Water Jet.  An excellent product at a very good price.,5
13880,rubber covering on power button tore within weeks.  == trimmer would not raise after months of use.  still using without trimmer.,3
13881,Blades do not cut good. You have to clip multiple times to get a clean cut. Not good quality.,1
13882,Does not provide as close of a trim as I would like.,4
13883,The guys love them and they are cheaper then what they where using and they say they get a better shave,5
13884,It was a real  piece of junk! After  using it  one or two times it broke.,1
13885,"Color is good, but does not last.  Even 1/2 way through the day I look like I did not put any blush on at all.",3
13886,"It is a good product, but I mainly use it with the cover to measure the cut levels. This function does not work well.",4
13887,Great blades.  It shaves very close and I get several uses,4
13888,I love this. It will last me a long time. I use this for my natural hair and to massage my body as well!,4
13889,Couldn't get backing off.so I can't use.what a waste,1
13890,I think this product is great for people who have less skin sensitivity. It took my skin almost 2 weeks to recover.,1
13891,"Easy to apply, doesn't smell, and works. Perfect sunscreen!",5
13892,"The nosepieces install easily enough, but the adhesive doesn't hold them on for long. Back to the drawing board!",2
13893,This is a very nice fragrance whether it's worn by itself or mixed with another airy fragrance. My teenage daughter loves it.,4
13894,If you buy this pillow be prepared to open it and restuff it yourself! The stuffing inside is very sparse and starts to disappear after using!!,1
13895,I used this alone as a growth treatment and my nails did grow in stronger.,4
13896,these only whiten the teeth they completely touch.  The  Crest whitestrips are better by far!,1
13897,Terrible stuff the doesn't even work.  Smell is horrible !!!,1
13898,wish I would have spent a little more & got the heavy 1..this falls over a lot,4
13899,Its very pretty and looks great in my bathroom.  The only issue I have with it is that it wobbles a little.,3
13900,"This gave me bumps on my skin - I was trying to get rid of the bumps from my rosacea, and this just made it worse!",1
13901,"Great for the price, very small! Just for fun little gems for the nails. They r for my 13 year old niece.",5
13902,The control on the handle would stick and within two weeks it stuck closed.  This is one more cheaply made product.,1
13903,"Item received in reasonable time. Dissapoonted with the quality, flimsy and not practical (lined with felt - difficult to clean).",2
13904,this cleanser is the best ever for dry skin. it smells good too.  i absolutely love it. hope they don't stop making it.,5
13905,"I love this soap, and it smells good. I use this to make laundry soap.",5
13906,Worked well before recharge.  Useless after the first recharge.,2
13907,Stained my stamper. And it tottly suck cuz the stampers where not cheap. I have photos but it won't let me add them.,1
13908,"I want to know the Voltage Adjustment of 7140.
Is it suit for 100V to 240V?
Thanks!",4
13909,"Took FOREVER to arrive. Also they're  super tiny, picture makes them seem way bigger than they actually are. ",1
13910,"Met wife''s expectations. Wanted very thin, very soft and got it.",4
13911,"Nice, Can wear different colors to match outfits without the expensive cost/",4
13912,My item arrived looking like it had already been used.,1
13913,Got these for myself but could not got them on gave them to my daughter she loves them wears them all the time thanks Amazon,5
13914,Mine was defective and the ball won't come off. Very disappointed. Didn't only happen to me either.,1
13915,My husband has soft skin and rough this hair which grows fast. These are by far his favorite blades.,5
13916,Shipped in a protected box...arrived on time and brand new just like how you would receive it in store.....cleaner is bit expensive,3
13917,"This is our first diffuser, and it works great.  The lighting feature is an appreciated extra.  Very easy to use!",5
13918,believed flosser would produce a higher pressure stream  also body shakes when dialing up pressure past 5  does an adequate job of flossing,3
13919,"The top was cracked, the pink goop is messy.  I was looking for real wax, not this chemical junk",3
13920,"Could be bigger, but works really well for my makeup",4
13921,It was ok while I had the shaver. Started going through the foils too fast.,4
13922,"Style is ok, but the roots are way to dark, looks horrible...",1
13923,We use it everyday with our baby!! It really works and the product is very safe!,5
13924,"This razor and brush stand is classy in its simplicity. I no longer mind seeing my husband's shaving ""stuff"" on the bathroom counter.",5
13925,its rubber. i prefer the hard cases but at least this will keep it from scratching. not the best if you might drop it,3
13926,It works well although it doesn't work as quickly as I wish it would.,3
13927,I bought it for my wife. She just loved it.,5
13928,"Although I bought the wrong product, they are still great! :)",4
13929,Perfect for stamping! It's thick so it really adheres to the stamp. Highly recommend!!,5
13930,"It's cheap, it's OEM, and it cleans and lubricates your razor. What's not to love?",5
13931,It works better then string but I don't know if the vibration really does anything?,4
13932,Good holding gel but you would have to add water if you don't want the white residue left on the hair after brushing.,4
13933,this is the second time we purchase this items.  we are very happy.,4
13934,Doesn't break me out( and I have very oily skin) use day and night,5
13935,Great product! Great price!! I use this product on my skin every night and it works wonders :-),4
13936,It took a very long time to get here. It is much shorter then I thought it would be. It is not as described .,3
13937,"Replacement for older Norelco heads. Much sharper, producing a smoother cut, and no rash. Has continued staying sharp, 6 months.",4
13938,"Well, it did everything it's suppose to do but the waves were too little where your hair felt fake.",1
13939,They seemed too small and were moving all over the place in my bikini.,2
13940,100 blades for less than 11 dollar who's going to grip blade work for about 15 shaves,5
13941,Great deal!  Just what I wanted!  Very pleased with product and service.  I definitely recommend. Good value for a good product!,5
13942,"I love the color but probably more suitable for younger skin.  It's very dramatic, needs to be blended well",3
13943,"Nice shaving bowl. Solid wood, nice finish. Pretty decent quality for the price.",4
13944,This is a nice grapeseed oil. I received a discount for my review and that has no bearing on the review itself.,5
13945,Actually pretty good quality for the price! Would buy more.,4
13946,It puts curl in the hair without using a curling Iron.  I have very short hair and they have a 1/2 inch version which is great for me,5
13947,Price and conveniance We like the comfort and the cleaning effect also the handle with the easy grip for our hands,4
13948,These turned the first day of wearing them!! What a waste....so disappointed!!!,1
13949,Much larger than I expected it to be.  I was looking for a smaller travel version.  But it's a good brush.,4
13950,where's my makeup????? cant track & I don't have it. it would be nice if I could track my package,1
13951,"has a strong scent, does help raise hairs so shaving is easier.",4
13952,works great for our trips.  sturdy construction. packs up small and compact,4
13953,"The Philips Norelco shaving system works great.  It is very easy to clean and cuts the beard close, leaving no burn.",5
13954,water stays inside the handle ...and now im worried about mold,2
13955,"The bar is too small for a belly button ring!
Disappointed ",1
13956,"IT APPEARS THIS IS WORKING ON MY AGE SPOTS ON MY HANDS, HAVEN'T BEEN USING IT LONG ENOUGH TO GIVE A TRUE REVIEW.",4
13957,I have almost finished my first bottle and have not noticed any more hair growth but am hopeful that I will if I continue to take this product.,4
13958,Cheaply made product.  Inflated once and the seam let go.  Would not hold air.  I would not recommend this product.,1
13959,This product smells soo good. It made me itch.,3
13960,I don't see any difference in my skin.  Maybe not as potent as it could be.  It should show more signs of hydration.,2
13961,"Not my favorite so far. Although the bar itself has a scent, it doesn't really come out once applied to the skin.",3
13962,I ordered this after i had a passion party. I wasn't sure that it would work but it is actually very nice.,4
13963,Inconsistent in quality but does the job if you don't mind tossing a few after one use.,3
13964,Been using  since April no hair growth. Love  the  shine it gives my hair.,4
13965,"Favorite floss, and I floss every day so I've tried a few brands.",5

13967,Did not have a close to keep soap from falling out,2
13968,"Would not run or charge, Got my money back after sending it back.",1
13969,Great cheap alternative to Boom sticks for mature women by Cindy Joseph.  Love the sheer glimmery was of color.,5
13970,Face feels clean after use but not dried out.  Truly a gentle but effective cleanser.,5
13971,This is the second one we have purchased. It works well and does the job advertised.,4
13972,"Great product! Very efficient shave. Easy to clean. Holds its charge for a long time. The trimmer isn't much, buy that seperate.",4
13973,Maybe the ones on Amazon are old or something because mine are all crumbly and hard to apply.,1
13974,"Cheap, thats what I paid for.  Before they were used the hair was falling out.  Let my daughter use them for painting.",2
13975,I've only had it for less than a week and the product is half way gone already. Not entirely thrilled with this soap.,2
13976,"The fit a tad bit smaller than the red vision does, which makes them a tiny bit uncomfortable. But too bad.",3
13977,"Didn't receive all colors only black and silver. Aside from the that, they are great.",4
13978,Does an excellent job. Was recommended by my Dentist and he was right on.,5
13979,"Great product, silky smooth application with just the right coverage for everyday and weekend wear",4
13980,I had just read in a health magazine how good the waterpik is for your gums. Easy to use and exactly what I wanted.,5

13984,"please do not buy this product, the paint comes off of it, makes your hands and book dirty. Stay AWAY!",1
13985,I bought this for my husband.  He uses it daily and has no complaints.  He likes the close cut.,4
13986,This is still the best lip balm and I am only able to find it on Amazon now...,4
13987,"I love all the pretty colors , perfect  but small bar came out why you're sleeping",4
13988,Not a big variety of colors as they show. Mostly blue.,2
13989,"Ok, if a bit floral smell wise, but I have been using it for 6 plus weeks and no change in men approaching me!",2
13990,"not sure how the product is, but the customer service is incredible.",4
13991,I'd rather shave with a carrot peeler. These blades suck.,1
13992,"Wasn't as pretty as pictured, but worked for my 4 year old for Halloween.  I imagine it would be small for an adult.",4
13993,"The waterpik ultra purpose to clean gum and between your teeth is great,but the unit makes a lot of noise and vibrates across the vanity.",3
13994,"Nice small sized samples to try. Fragrance gets getting used to, but I like it. A little of everything.",4
13995,Brushes are very cheaply made. Not what I expected but it's very affordable so can't complain too much.,1
13996,Not worth the time and effort. These do not stay on your nails more than a day.,2
13997,"my wife live this product, but shipping was very very slow. 13 days",4
13998,Not what I thought to be. Very small stones. Can hardly see them when wearing them.,1
13999,THIS IS A CORDED SHAVER . I made the mistake of assuming that all shavers come with a Battery . other than that its a pretty decent shaver,3
14000,Great blade for money & seem to hold their sharpness longer.,4
14001,Nice pink color - don't really care for the application brush,4
14002,"I can't get them to work, not that they were made for 34DDD - but yeah, these don't work. Nice try.",1
14003,Awesome shampoo.  My hair feels much healthier. I use this shampoo with kerastese conditioner. The best prices are found on Amazon.,4
14004,Works as advertised.  I get 4 to 8 days from one blade.,4
14005,Bought it for my wife.  She loves it.  It is compact and best of all it the quietest of any hair dryer she has had.,5
14006,"I adore this fragrance, my favorite it fact, however the smell doesn't last long. I wish it came in an ear de parfum!",3
14007,"Yes, I love this product also.  As posted for shampoo and conditioner.  I first used this product on a Disney Cruise and fell in love.",5
14008,I do not recommend this product. It stopped working in 9 months. Not well made and only a 30 warranty.,2
14009,"Great for someone who doesn't want fragrance or color in their shampoo. Good also for little kids or babies, like it says.",4
14010,"causes static in hair, the handle has a bad design, bristles not long enough",1

14012,"Just what I needed. I wear the  turban to bed or in my home.
 Lee B.",4
14013,"Incredibly mushy and gummy. The worst lipstick I have ever purchased. I seriously never write reviews, but this sucks that bad.",1
14014,"The product was good but the price was too high. I have bought this same product, different maker for as little st $6.00.",4
14015,Lots of power and pretty lightweight. Just wish attachment fit more securely.,4
14016,"Order this over and over I love it, does just what it claims to do. I will not go without it.",4
14017,The product was to big for my nose it never said it was gaged the gems were extremely small I was extremely disappointed.,1
14018,Underside not flat... It hurts my head to wear because of that,1
14019,"Dentist recommended using it and I like it. Leaves a clean, fresh feeling. Gets areas that flossing may miss. Use every time I brush.",4
14020,"My god,  I would have liked this soap a lot better if it didn't make my face burn like acid after every use!",2
14021,Product didn't cover all my hair and fell apart after two months of use,2
14022,Clean and bright!! Just what I needed!!,1
14023,This broke within the first week of having it. :/,3
14024,"I'm so glad that this was for my child, as it would never fit an adult.",3
14025,Actual size are huge. I expected them to be smaller,3
14026,"color was good, but I thought it was dry,. kinda hard to apply.",3
14027,"It was a waste of money, almost no air blowing from this unit and the brush is not spinning.",2
14028,"Nice but when I got it, one on them was damage",1
14029,"Good product, we've always loved this and am glad found in a larger size",5
14030,It is darker than I thought. Also it's very thick and a bit hard to spread.  Not buying it again.,3
14031,"They serve the purpose, but wish they were a little thicker washcloth.",4
14032,My face feels so clean and refreshed. My black heads have disappeared and my pimples are gone within a day or two!,5
14033,I like this grey coverage but I  have to be careful not to color my scalp when applying. Last all day though!,4
14034,I bought this for my sister and in the mail 8 came broken but other than that they are good! ,3
14035,It was expired and doesn't have a tingling feeling like it's supposed to. Very unhappy,1
14036,Cleaned my hair and was easy to travel with. Not a fan of this particular scent,3
14037,Tried the recipe for cellulite reduction and after three uses I'm seeing results! Will definitely be purchasing more.,4
14038,i really don't know. i bought as a present. i don't know something about this item. i did't hear something from my friend.,3
14039,You get what you pay for. Very flimsy cheaply made. I know it's just an altar cloth but still.,2
14040,It feels and acts like a normal 5$ Comb. I don't see the benifit of it being handmade.,3
14041,Mine didn't come with the box and the wrap around the bottle was open,3
14042,"Very Nice set, love it. I is good for your skin and feels luxurious . Would purchase again.",5
14043,I didn't like the smell. It was too strong and the bottle leaked inside the box. I returned it for a refund.,1
14044,I rather like to paint the nails. to stamp they are not like me very clear. and the colors are beautiful,3
14045,This has got to be the worst denture powder I have every tried. It was a complete waste of my money.,1
14046,required some assembly. Standard wig head needed  to have its opening widened to fit on the standing post.,4
14047,"poorly made, Seemed to be offrered as being similar to the ones made by Cross, but not.",1
14048,"Really it works but I don't know how to use it in a proper way
The seller find not send any instruction",4
14049,"This gave me insomnia, and since I already struggle with sleep issues, I switched to DIM.",1
14050,Great all around hygien product. Good size for traveling with travel kit.,4
14051,I like the old tape that I was ordering better in the red wrapping.,4
14052,Helps nails dry much faster...the only reason I didn't give it full stars is it is a little messy the greasy stuff gets everywhere.,4
14053,The Philips Norelco 1250X/47 SensoTouch 3D Electric Razor with Jet Clean...is a quiet runing razor. It gives a close even shave.,4
14054,I purchased a number of these as gifts and everyone who received them loved them. That is what anyone giving a gift wants. Right?,5
14055,It did not fit properly it's also turn from white to grey,2
14056,"Its not what it advertizes about, it don't work or do nothing for me, would not recommend to use it",1
14057,Way too big and bottom half looks unfinished as if it is the back of the piece. Cheap looking.,1
14058,does a good job of holding shave tools and it looks good doing it.,4
14059,"kids enjoy the sparkels, bought for their fun times doing nails, they have fun witht he gems one time purchase enough for me",4
14060,I noticed zero difference when using this. Smell wasn't as bad as other reviewers mentioned though.,2
14061,If you have extra dry cuticles not the best option. Still looking for something better.,3
14062,Doesn't eliminate odors very well.  Not good at all for farts.,3
14063,"Very greasy but I knew it was going to be like this, works great in the skin really help with the dryness, I like it",5
14064,This is very small and it is a lot in each square. Worth the purchase and i am very happy over all.,4
14065,Love the product but the pump is funky and clogs.,4
14066,Great little hairdryer to travel with. I have a lot of hair and it dries it pretty quickly. Great price too.,4
14067,"If you are usually a small, order medium. So I would suggest ordering 1 size up.",3
14068,Works great and does the job! Super happy with this purchase thus far!,5
14069,This is the best brand of blush.love the colors too.,1
14070,"Exactly what I was looking for, for my daughter's dance recital...I just wish it came with instructions.",4
14071,"I bought this as a gift for my daughter in law, I read it was good if you are expecting",4
14072,"I purchased the hands to practice acrylic nails, and they do the job just fine!!! Iam ready to order more",4
14073,This really didn't work for what I wanted it for so not sure how to rate it so I hate to rate it.,2
14074,"I purchased this product because of the number of positive reviews. Turns out that this product is good, but not as good as everyone says.",3
14075,only 1 tag... where is the other one???,3
14076,I not only love the item but am so very pleased that I received it so quickly.  Thank you!,5
14077,Nice product for the moneyu. Works great. Quick Shipment/,4
14078,"My wife has bought several of these.  She likes them, but the ""spikes"" start breaking almost immediately.",2
14079,They seem to do the job. Have yet to replace the first blade after 2 weeks of use.,4
14080,Completely useless product. Used 4 bottles of the stuff and got nothing out of it.  Use listerine. Cheaper and taste a whole lot better.,1
14081,"i really liked this product.  never really bought ""lady"" shaving cream before.  My skin didn't react either.  Def would buy again.",4
14082,"Product was hard to push through the tube, hard to apply, appeared old as it crumbled along the sides.  Would not recommend.",1
14083,I have not seen a vast improvement but it's only been a few weeks. But what I see so far is encouraging. Will buy again,4
14084,"Good product, we take it to camping with us.  It is very useful for everyone. I recommend this to you.",4
14085,Have not used this item but a couple of times.  Nice product to have as it does several things in a couple of sprays.,4
14086,it works but takes longer to take off gel polish than expected and sometimes it does get a little warm.,3
14087,WAYYY TOOOO SMALL. IT WILL HURT YOUR NOSE TRYING TO GET IT ON.,1
14088,I need to buy it for my wife comos exam. I think it a right price for the right product.,4
14089,I'm been using toji since September my hair is growing and definitely thicker.,4
14090,It lasted less than 2 years. It works great for as long as it works.,3
14091,I love the wax but it was 3 times the price on Amazon.,1
14092,The product does it make it a month but it doesn't nice job prepping  and  cleaning the razor,4
14093,This purchase was actually to replace the same bodygroomer I purchased 3 years ago.  The bodygroomer is great for both me and my husband.,5
14094,...for how it goes on...takes a while to balance the color evenly. I thought it would go on smoother. But overall its ok.,3
14095,Arrived and performs as presented. Not unattractive and well made sink top storage for my Merkur and badger,5
14096,Great for reducing weight in travel luggage and the shampoo is great!  Highly recommend.,5
14097,This toothbrush is by Oral-B but not the one pictured. The one I received does the job but I wanted the other model.,3
14098,Really great. Light oil that absorbs after you rub it in for a bit.,4
14099,These don't work as well as Nads green strips. Stick to those.,2
14100,Have never tried a product that provideds a barrier beteeen scalp and appliance.  Seems to do the job very well.,4
14101,Top is not as secure as it it should be. Item leaks easily.,4
14102,Cheaply made but good as a travel kit. The cutter width is small and don't expect it to give you a shave.,2
14103,Use it as the directions specify. Only problem is that it requires running hot water until it warms up to fill the reservoir.,4
14104,"does whats is supposed to do. however, it makes skin very very dry , it feels overstretched..",4
14105,I would have ordered a size smaller but I like the way it heats up fast. I will order the 1 inch next.,4
14106,I really didn't like it is not that good like they say,1
14107,Made my hair super dry & brittle! Color is good but don't think its all natural. Made my hair fall more.,2
14108,Babe got a rash and broke mom's face out too. :-(,1
14109,A fine quality comb I use for my large beard and mustache.,5
14110,I use it every day. Works great and quality is very good.,5
14111,"Not a magical cure, but seems to help keep Eczema in check.",4
14112,I have needed something to help hold my leg up while shaving in the shower.  This is just the thing.,4
14113,"Crap! Put batteries in, turned on,  it buzzed for 2 seconds then nothing!! Don't buy!",1
14114,Pink Blush looks really nice. Its a much more sort of a pale pink than i wanted i guess you could call it.,4
14115,Love the smell and feel of this all natural lotion. Absorbs into the skin quickly.,5
14116,"Nice set, good price. I didn't use them as a separator but as a sewing machine bobbin holders.",5
14117,Seems to do the trick. A little early to give an excellent review though.,4
14118,"Great for my thinning hair. Doesn't weigh it down at all. I just need a drop, and it covers my whole head.",5
14119,"great product! only gripe - wish it would run on 220v mains, too",3
14120,My latest purchase arrived with the capsules in a very damp and moist position. I was very disappointed and nothing is being done about it???,1
14121,It's a slow trimmer. Not worth the price you're spending.,1
14122,Solid product. Helps get the leftover gunk out of my teeth a picker can't.,4
14123,This is thick and uncomfortable and just promotes folds amount itself. So I have not found this to be very helpful.,1
14124,The product is fine but it is very small. Probably meant for a child.,3
14125,Not good for very sensitive skin. The dyes and perfumes in even the sensitive skin ones irrate my skin.,2
14126,"A little messy, but gets better with practice. However, the important point is that it removes the hair very well! underarms, legs etc.",4
14127,Exactly what I expected cute little rhinestones with every color it was a great purchase I should recommend any girl to buy one,4
14128,"Came fast, and all ready put together excellent price. ...very satisfied",5
14129,I love this Shampoo and told my friends about it.,5
14130,This product really gets the job done. I would recommend it to people who just want to shape up and look well groomed.,4
14131,Will not keep full of air. The top suction cups won't stick. Rated C-,1
14132,This product smells amazing.  The orders show up quickly.  My hair looks shiny and feels silky smooth.  I'm hooked!!,5
14133,great price. Love that these are 2 sided for removal of tough/dead skin. Leaves you feeling clean and fresh,4
14134,"This can't be what they are charging over $100 for? Smelled terrible, did nothing for me after 3 weeks and felt slimy.",1
14135,I purchased this as a gift.  I have had no response from the receiver of this gift.  I hope he likes it.,3
14136,so it and the medications you take affects your sex life.  This does provide some help  and no side effects like the medication,3
14137,this was a good knife and I use it all the time shipping was on time and I will order agine,4
14138,This stuff is surprisingly nice! Feels like it's actually helping my dry nails. Not oily and absorbs quickly,4
14139,Results in just one overnight process! Love it!!,5
14140,This stuff doesn't hold very well AT ALL. 2-3 weeks max. I'll stick to the name brand Walker tape going forward.,1
14141,I purchased this for daughter when she got her braces.  Invaluable tool for keeping her teeth clean. Easy to use.,4
14142,Razor handle is okay.  Get's dirty and unable to clean after a while.  Razors are excellent though.,4
14143,"The item works as expected and very good qulaity, I would recommend this to anyone.",5
14144,Not able to apply it to a sponge.  Don't like the way I had to get it out the container.  Came out in clumps,1
14145,"its a pretty good set of brushes but its very small , more of a travel size set nevertheless there still great and super soft :)",3
14146,beautiful color. very soft and is sweet foe my surprise! I love it,4
14147,It works well just  doesn't trim as close as I would like.,4
14148,"Using for two boys haircuts at home, ages 5 and 7. Worked as expected. No complaints.",4
14149,Beautiful tawny nude color that will definitely last all day and through the night.,4
14150,Arrived quickly and works great.  Wish they were a little less expensive!,4
14151,I loved the unit but it stopped working after five months.,1
14152,Has a weird taste  so I don't use it much but it does stay better then any other lip stick I have ever had.,3
14153,This product is great for going under bridges but if frays too easily.  Our dentist suggested a more substantial Oral-B product.,2
14154,It doesn't work it is messy and it pearl poorly heats up,1
14155,Awful. It makes your hair sticky and comes off when you touch your hair. Would like to return it!,1
14156,Does the job. Seems like sturdier construction that previous unit.,4
14157,"Broke already today because the item was only loosely connected to the shaver.

This is something which can not be fixed and a new replacement is required.",2
14158,This product does NOT WORK . company also sent me this product and it was expired . Highly disappointed .,1
14159,One of the devices is broken. It doesn't roll upwards.,1
14160,Great color but it dried out my lips. When I ate or drank there was an embarrassing line on my lips. Felt gross.,2
14161,"Love the ingredients, but it did not support my curls well.",3
14162,My fault actually. I tried the wrong AC voltage amplitude on the machine and it immediately short circuited so I don't know if it works.,3
14163,This cap fit my head to tight.  If I had worn it all night I would have a bad headache in the morning.,2
14164,DOESN'T WORK EVEN ON FINE HAIR. NICE SMELL BUT OILY.,2
14165,"It works as it should. It did seem a little flimsy, like it wasn't quite the thickness of the tubing I replaced.",4
14166,"Results are good, but they don't stay put.",3
14167,Not like photo waiting on seller response before i return. What i recvd is oily soft and white. Not like photo at all....more like butter,1
14168,Long lasting durable blades. I use it on my dog and haven't changed,4
14169,"I like the product, but it arrived broken. The first time I took the lid off, all of the makeup fell out.",3
14170,Love it!  First time trying MSM cream and I will definitely be buying more,5
14171,Good buy but way goes on to thick and leaves greasy feeling,2
14172,"Really Nice, Works perfectly. is what i was looking for in this product. Recommended 100 %, Easy to use. Excellent purchase.",4
14173,Groomer works fine. One full charge of the battery lasts for several shaves.,3
14174,Does what it is suppoed to do.  Leaves my teeth and gums feeling very clean.,4
14175,I got this for my Mom and she likes it to use as a backup.  It was very cheap.,4
14176,Genius product from the company that defined the category in the 60's. Works well under many different conditions with the pic selections.,5
14177,This was the first product I purchased as a massage oil and I like it.  It is not too oily and has no smell.,4
14178,Doesn't work as promised and is a rip off very small tube for the price.,1
14179,Too large for short hair - so I didn't try it merely returned.,3
14180,"Just got out if the shower and had to give this great reviews, it is a durable little thing. I love it.",5
14181,I did not like the way it made my hair feel.  Also hard to get it all over my hair.,1
14182,"The color is clear and matt ,but not buttery , i used gloss with it",2
14183,"I love the rich, thick consistency of this lotion. The smell is amazing and I look forward to purchasing more very soon",4
14184,This blush is great for daily use. Adds subtle color and glow to face without going over the top or looking fake.,4
14185,My old razor works like new.  I am very satisfied and recommend this replacement head to anyone seeking to make their old razor just like new.,4
14186,These earrings are made cheap. They broke the first time I wore them,1
14187,"Doesn't fit snugly enough - it always comes off in my purse - but it is a lovely, vibrant color!",3
14188,Nice change from orgasm. Like this one too. Shipped fast and well.,4
14189,"Unfortunately these are not the lemon scent as advertised. These also did not come in Braun packaging, just some clear plastic.",1
14190,This blush is great for daily use. Adds subtle color and glow to face without going over the top or looking fake.,4
14191,"Great  I really lile tbis produc
 i ha  d a hard ome to fime the product that I likedt thank ypu",5
14192,Like everybody else mention it it does make your lashes look thicker but there is a lot of little flakes that fall off,3
14193,"Totally different color, instead of the one I requested I received the other set is listed",1
14194,for my daughter.  She thinks it's great.he word maximum on this is rediculous.  Don't feel like ever filling these out again,5
14195,I ordered this soap and could barely detect a scent to it. I have always ordered Plantlife brand and it smells heavenly!,1
14196,The shears finger opening are to small for a mens fingers-gave them to my wife to use.,2
14197,"right for the price right for the price right for the price right for the price
not very easy to clean
but cheap, so that is enough",3
14198,Great product. Covers grey hair extremely well. Able to extend the time between coloring!!!,5
14199,Very nice oils. We liked the viscosity and aroma.,5
14200,"Non greasy, feels like it firms my skin, I suffer from eczema and this really calms the tightness, redness and pain associated the peeling skin",4
14201,"Arrived on time, decent price.  Good for clearing out the body.",5
14202,"Close, but not exactly the same fragrance.  Years ago, this product was made in the USA.  I believe this was imported.",3
14203,This bath powder doesn't smell as it should.  Don't  know if it's a knock-off or just old  Won't buy it again.,1
14204,Not worth the price as it works equally to a cheap Suave conditioner,2
14205,"Great dental floss. My teeth are close, and gets in between them well.  Other flosses tear.",5
14206,it was hard to use and gel seemed dried out.,1
14207,Very good product. I love the new fresh smell and how it feels after shaving.,5
14208,My son has sensory issues so relaxing before bed isn't always easy for him. The bubble bath smells amazing and lasts all night.,4
14209,Perfect for keeping my curls intact while I sleep and toss and turn. Comfy fit.,5
14210,This serum leaves my skin feeling a little sticky for a few hours after application. The minor scent is not noticeable soon after you apply it.,3
14211,Really love how this works. I have fine hair and it really gives me the body I need and it stays in.,5
14212,I love the scent of the music. Unfortunately they don't make this anymore but it's the best,5
14213,The newer model works better in the on-off switching of the finger control.  Gets out what floss can't ... Great for keeping gums healthy.,5
14214,Had to buy this as my Conair makeup mirror had one bulb that burned out. Looks just like the others,4
14215,Lives up to its promises.  Used with coochie cream my shaving experience is no longer a dreaded one.  Almost no bumps ever.,4
14216,"Boyd""s bears Calendar ... always a great gift for the child in all of  us ... will certainly buy the 2017 edition.",5
14217,This is truely one of my favorite frangrances.  Light but sultry at the same time.  I actually prefer it to the original #5.,5
14218,"You get what you paid for, they are low quality brushes but nevertheless work great.",4
14219,We thought it was the whole head with blades not realizingnit was just the blades. It was too expensive for what we got.,2
14220,Easy to use and i love the way my skin feels after using it.,4
14221,it is very cute. I like it. it is just un-comfy to wear. Overall good headband.,4
14222,I am disabled and this creme has proven to keep my lower body skin supple. Incredible stuff!,5
14223,I like this dental floss because I have issues with other types of floss getting caught between my teeth.,5
14224,"I like it, may need to use it a few months to see results..",3
14225,"Good product - vacuum (no stray bits of hair), self-sharpinging, holds a long charge, works in close quarters, very competative price",4
14226,I really like this color it is a little lighter than the MAC rebel,4
14227,Not enough teeth in the iron to keep the  hair in place on the iron.  It didn't work for my hair.,2
14228,I went ahead and did the upper body lift with augmentation instead of my face lift 3 weeks ago because these work so well.,5
14229,"This is better than buying a new razor,it's cheaper and you will feel  like you have a new razor.",4
14230,Way to big. Cap fit to loose on your head. Durag works much better for waves.,1
14231,Looked like an old box. All taped up and shopped worn. Bars are very slim,1
14232,Smells so fake and awful. Why don't products offer unscented creams!!,1
14233,Great samples of makeup!!  Just love it! Will be ordering more!,5
14234,I wouldve gave 5 stars but they gave me three clear balls and only one of the three is somewhat cute,4
14235,"This product works ok, I found another product that works much better",3
14236,"It was wayyy darker than it looked, but honestly that's probably my fault.  Even still, great color payout.",4
14237,Received this October 7 2014 and is already broke! And I have no way of getting a hold of the company.,1
14238,"this was a gift, so I HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING IF HE WAS PLEASED OR NOT.  I'll have to wait to hear from him",3
14239,Could be softer.  Does not clean as well as others.,3
14240,Arrived broken...appears that glue melted so the stone shifted..,3
14241,Its hard to control the spray but if you can master that it covers great!,3
14242,Products were dried and couldn't lift any hair at all.,1
14243,"Couldn't see paying the prices of the ""original"" ones.  Works just fine.",4
14244,"Not all that, still looking for a ultimate edge control",2
14245,Too large for short hair - so I didn't try it merely returned.,3
14246,i came home and just put it in my hair and tried a pomp..ehh it does what its supposed to do but if its pomade its missing its shine,4
14247,"I have been buying this soap for many years now.  Love the fragrance....not too overwhelming, yet it lasts a long time.",5
14248,"I absolutely love this produce, the seller mailed the shipment very quickly and I received it in perfect condition.",5
14249,cuts very well. I don't feel that the battery last very long though. by the end of your haircut it will be dead,3
14250,"I found it a little hard to put on, but otherwise it is wonderful. Definitely worth the price that I paid.",4
14251,"This electric razor is priced well.  It is noisy, but in the abscence of time or a traditional razor and shaving cream it works well enough.",4
14252,"I ordered, it came, it's cream.  I don't know if it helps or not.",3
14253,Returned the item so can't really know weather good or not.,1
14254,"Mom said it was one of"" the best gizmos I have gotten her "". Love it.",5
14255,"This is a great place to purchase the claner if you own the razor

Shipment was swift. I'm very happy",4
14256,The tape sticks well and works to tighten facial skin creating a younger look. Very affective.,4
14257,useful  but bit pricey for the small amount in the bottle.,4
14258,"Took care of my flaky scalp, a problem I've had for years.",5
14259,My daughter has been able to do lots of designs. But hair is thin and uneven,4
14260,It's a pretty peach color that's perfect for everyday. It doesn't last very long though,4
14261,"Doesn't work at all, do not buy these.",1
14262,Pure junk. Very disappointed. Not even able to return. ,1
14263,Very disappointed in their products. Wears off very quickly within 2-3 hours of applying.,1
14264,I used this alone as a growth treatment and my nails did grow in stronger.,4
14265,"So watered down, I didn't feel like it was actually shampoo. I tried twice then threw it away.",1
14266,"Does what it is supposed to, keeps you from getting razor rash and ingrown hairs. Will buy again when needed.",4
14267,We use these with every bath. Just love them!,5
14268,"This was a gift for a close friend, but I haven't heard yet how it was received.  I'll report again after I hear something.",4
14269,Best product Pantene made and can't find it in stores anymore.,5
14270,"This is pretty much the best lotion ever. Thick, creamy, and long lasting!",5
14271,When I opened the package the top of the machine was cracked in 3 different places.. I did get a full refund though and it does work good,3
14272,Sure our feet peeled but they didn't work on calluses and it dried the skin out so much that they felt awful just a week after.,2
14273,Wasn't quite as efficient as I would have hoped however the after wax oil was fantastic,4
14274,"A little too tight fit, but did the job!",4
14275,"I never thought Amazon is such a worst company.  Worst customer support, never buy either this item or other items from Amazon.",1
14276,Like every thing about it except the hose is a bit too short unless the device is moved right to the edge of the sink.,4
14277,Loved the glasses although didn't not come with case like shown,4
14278,It is helpful. I do cut myself at times. The doctor told me to use it. And the size helps me to find it.,4
14279,They work pretty good except the bigger one from all that one don't work for s***,3
14280,Quite disappointed in the shaver. expected a much closer shave,1
14281,The cream makes my skin soft and moist but I haven't noticed any difference in fine lines and wrinkles.,3
14282,"This is a pretty color but it's a bit drying. It also has a strong, but not unpleasant, smell and taste.",3
14283,This product is a lifesaver between trips to the salon.,4
14284,Bought for granddaughter to use with retro dress. She loves it.,4
14285,"These are great for the price, however I do think Gillette Nacet's are a slightly higher quality",4
14286,was excited to receive this and it got to me broken that is the reason why i gave it one star,1
14287,Shipping was reasonable. But did come broken. I was able to fix it tho!,3
14288,Melted and burned my hair which fell out in clumps....Blistered my scalp.,1
14289,I purchased the toothbrush from my dentist. The brushes are cheaper from Amazon than my dentist.,5
14290,it did everything it advertised it would. it does a really good job. I would recommend this to all ages,4
14291,"LOVE this.  I can floss my whole mouth in about ONE minute -- without hurting myself (by pushing down floss too hard, etc.)",5
14292,Two jars were moldy and had to be thrown away.  The rest were fine.,2
14293,"Lots of power, close shave. Out shaves the Braun it replaced. Not crazy about the trimmer. Good shaver for the money.",4
14294,"Worked good for 3 weeks then lost pressure. Only used filtered water. Cleaned it regularly with vinegar as instructed, no help. Really disappointed!",2
14295,"This does the job just fine, but you have to remove the guard to get any real work done. In general, a great product.",4
14296,"It's nice to have an extra, since my daughter and I both like oils diffused in our rooms at night.",5
14297,"Has a nice smell and absorbs well. Just your basic lotion, imo......",4
14298,Seems to be working well. I will reorder when when this supply runs out.,4
14299,Surprisingly it is effective for my younger sister but not for my mom!,3
14300,"If you have to clean dental bridges these are best thing I have used. One piece design, no muss, no fuss.",5
14301,Smells like rotten fish. Can't use this product without wanting to pewk,2
14302,"thrilled by the quality and price, an excellent value, exactly what I was looking for, could not have been any better",5
14303,"Just ""Okay.""

Not as sharp as I'd like, enough for a single shave.

Adequate due to price.",3
14304,"It is exactly what it looks like. Fits my razor and brush just fine, seems pretty stable.",4
14305,They aren't amazing but you I get what you pay for. I was surprised at how fast I got them though,3
14306,Does not work well for fine hair like children's hair,4
14307,Absolutely love this stuff won't use anything else for my baby.,5
14308,"I realy like it because it cleans deeply where the brush cant clean, the pressure is strong and i like that, highly recommended",5
14309,Only for certain skin types. left a rash on mine,1
14310,"Extremely cute, but hard to unscrew the ring at first!",4
14311,"Leaves an oily film on your skin after application. The scent is very pungently sour lemon hard candy, not lemon verbena.",3
14312,I love these wet or dry. I just wish they didn't break easily.,5
14313,"Shaver works better without the guard; however, it can cut the skin.",2
14314,Doesn't work. As if I applied nothing. Will be returning,1
14315,"The color is very nice, just what I expected.",4
14316,"I have only used the lotion once, but it smells very good before and after tanning",5
14317,this product works great.  I ordered the 3 pack 2 cans worked the other can had no color pigment in it.,4
14318,"Great lamp.

14327,"The ""identical"" item that my partner had previuosly purchased has a much stronger jet. I like theirs much better. Wah.",3
14328,"the only thing I don't like about this is my razor won't stay on it, but other than that its a good deal.",4
14329,"It looks like it's for a little girl , it's cute but not for a grown women ,",1
14330,My third Braun and lives up to my expectations.  Would recommend to anyone looking for a great shave at a reasonable price.,4

14337,"I'm not sure if the formula changed since I bought the last one, but the smell was different and the texture was different.",4
14338,Compared with other brand and models this is fast and easy to maintain We will wait to see how oftenthe cutter and foil need replacment,4

14346,I love how refreshing the soap makes me feel and how clean too,4
14347,Too loose for me around the center fabric itself. The band leaves deep marks on my forehead but it does stay on.,2
14348,I was really happy with this product until Amazon increased the price.  Now I buy a large bottle of lotion for the same price.,4
14349,It works very well. I wish it has a spare regular tip for an extra user rather than all the other special tips,4

14367,"The price was better than anywhere else, have used for years,  just like getting a manicure every day of the week",5

14378,Smells great! Goes on really smooth and it works!,5

14380,Works fine. There isn't anything excellent or terrible about this shaver.,3
14381,This is a pretty good vegetable glycerin. I haven't had any issues with it at all. I would buy again.,4
14382,I Bought from intellibrands. Worst decision of life. I got my package last week and the bottles were all broken.,1
14383,Works well but hard to rinse out! But was happy didn't cause eye irritation like all the others!,4
14384,"Great product, but price is ridiculous!!  $15 + dollars for 1 roll of tape!! Not acceptable!",2

14390,This broke after just a few uses - just stopped working.  Pretty bummed.,1
14391,Unit leaks and flange holder cracks and breaks. Do not waste money. Waterpik gone downhill in quality.,1
14392,Doesn't work. It also says the strips are good for more than one pass. Definitely aren't.,1
14393,It actually stays on my head but it's starting to peel after a few weeks of use. Wish it wouldn't peel so fast!,3
14394,Wish the fragrance was more clove than cinnamon which was what I was looking for.,3
14395,"Awesome, big clouds!!!!!!!",5
14396,Solid stand.  Definite must have to hold the brush and razor.,5
14397,I use L'Oreal Paris products every day. I just recently bought this toner and it is just fine for me.,5

14400,Great Product!  I have used many different kinds of files and this by far is the best.  NO PROBLEMS!!  LOVE IT!,5
14401,"This is the new formula, not the original formula.",1

14403,A must have for summer and wearing shorts! Helps in making my knees and legs look better.,5

14405,"I loved it bought it on my wed
ding it was great everyone loved it so i recommend it and it came on time",5
14406,"Very nice scent and helped my dry cuticles and hands. Also used for my dry scalp, but that didn't seem to help....",4
14407,These reviews would be more helpful if they stated what colors they used. Im white blonde & would like a mauve (ish ) color,4
14408,feels so good after a long day of hiking and I understand Bears do not like Peppermint.,4
14409,too expensive for what you get. Great smell and refresing but I rather just go to the store and not pay for shipping.,3

14416,the soap is smell very good but the price are a too high.,2
14417,"It's ok, it's really just a plain light wooden bowl. A touch on the small side, a little pricey for what it is.",4
14418,"This stuff takes me back to my boot camp days on Parris Island.  Clean, fresh scent.  Love it.",5
14419,"I still like the foam type better, but these worked.  If you like silicone nose pads, you'll probably like these.",3
14420,"Not my thing. One time purchase. I tried, though.",3
14421,"It'd be great if the needle sizes were labeled, it's kind of a pain to try and guess by eyeballing it.",4
14422,"Not the same bottles shown,the ones in the picture are much better quality",1
14423,Good toner for those with average skin type. Cleans and refreshes at a reasonable price. Cant go wrong with this.,4
14424,There is a nice variety of colors and it comes in a really nice case.  A lot of product for a low price!,4
14425,Purchased several boxes for my mother.  She suffers for arthritis  issues.  She swears by it and insists that nothing works as well.,5
14426,"My daughter wanted this, so I bought it for her...silly really  lolol",1
14427,"This is a fancy shaver but does not give a close shave, even with a pre shave cream.",3
14428,This stuff is amazing. I will never buy eyelash glue at the drugstore again!,5
14429,not sure why all the good reviews. This stuff feels gross in my hair.,2
14430,"Waterpik was recommended to me, and I wanted to try it - this one is just what I had hoped for, with a quick delivery also.",4
14431,I am really starting to like the Parker brand products. Good soap and good value. I don't know what else they want.,4
14432,Only comes with 1!!! Says it's comes with 2 but I only received 1. NOT worth the money,1
14433,"My husband loves this, says it is well balanced and easy to keep clean. It's perfect for the shaving brush we just purchased.",5
14434,The brushes came apart from the wooden handle I glued them back but the comb had broken teeth that was very upsetting.,3
14435,"It's ok, though to oily for my normak skin.
And it costs only 96 cents in Walgreens as I found out later((",3
14436,"The bracelet is very pretty but, not well designed it doesn't stay in place",2

14438,Not what I expected I don't use it because it's streaks and looks yellow,1
14439,Not Happy:( Product arrived today but seems very poor quality to me. Hope that after I use it I will be happier,1
14440,"I'm always trying good shampoos to improve texture, restore a little luster to colored hair.  This one does both very well.",4
14441,I received the wrong item and had to return it. I can't believe I had to pay postage to return an item that was your mistake,1
14442,Definitely a nice blade for the price. I'm able to get 2-3 uses per blade. Would buy again for sure.,4
14443,This is too much like Vaseline but more expensive.  Really thick and must try to not get on clothes and furniture.,1
14444,The wax warmer works well. However I did not receive the PreHon lotion with my kit. Otherwise it was all it was advertised to be.,2
14445,Cute but doesn't clasp close fully or strongly so most of the time it's dangling open.,3
14446,"I love this for anxiety, sleep, and pain.",5
14447,"Sponges do a nice job, hold color well, and easy to cut to size for different uses.  Also soft on the face",4
14448,Works great for my acne but have to use very little if not it will irritate my skin.,4

14454,I have fine hair and the balls on the end of the bristles don't comb it,3
14455,Difficult to peel off and look like thin grocery bag paper.,2
14456,I have short hair.  This did not grip it securely to curl.,2
14457,"Exactly as ordered. Works well, tingle isn't too bad. Only issue is does not remove makeup well. Does not dry out skin.",4
14458,"Doesn't work at all, so don't buy it.",1
14459,difficult to know what type of replacement to order model type on razor unreadable I order wrong type,3
14460,"ICK. THIS IS UN-SCENTED VASOLINE. GREASY, STICKY, DOES NOT SOAK IN. YUCK.",1
14461,I like this because it doesn't stain my clothes. I bought a different brand and it stained my polo shirts which are now ruined.,5
14462,"Packaging was good and delivery was fine, but I don't notice any ""big"" changes...just the same old stuff.",3
14463,"Good soap, but the scent isn't as strong as I'd hoped for.",4

14466,PLASTIC TIPS FALL OFF. OTHER THAN THAT IT WORKS GREAT.,3
14467,It didn't make my acne prone skin break out.,5
14468,received the waterpik and it works great at a very reasonable price. The price was 50.44 with free shipping.,4
14469,"Ordered the replacement part for my husband's Braun shaver - package arrived intact,  the parts fit and all is good!",5
14470,"Worth every penny.  Completely unique eau de parfum for men and women.  Sultry, mysterious, long-lasting.  Highly recommended!!!",5
14471,Not timpressed with this at all.  Power is very weak and it smells like it has been in a warehouse storage forever.,1
14472,"returned it, too expensive, found one for a lot cheaper",1
14473,This bulb was used less than 10 times and stopped working. Do not buy.,1
14474,"The Bar's Were Too Small, Or Maybe I Shoudlve Ordered Some Kind Of You Know, Different Type Or Something, Hm",1
14475,these were for my daughter for Christmas. she like them very much and still uses them a year later to do her nails.,4
14476,am i the only one whos having a problem twisting the product up? its not friggen workin!,3
14477,I don't like how the ingredients are not listed.,1
14478,"LOVE this.  I can floss my whole mouth in about ONE minute -- without hurting myself (by pushing down floss too hard, etc.)",5
14479,Easier to use than I expected.  I would recommend it in place of flossing. My dentist is the one who told me about it.,5
14480,"The BEST color, but doesn't stay well at all",4
14481,A great product and a must have in any men's wardrobe. Philips is surely a master in the grooming products ..,4
14482,"its ok for the price, but not sure if it is the product.. or the really bad applicator :/",3
14483,Zum Bar Frankincense & Myrrh-3 oz.  It smells so clean.  i really love it.  It's kind of expensive though.  Thanks,5
14484,It does NOT keep your lipstick from coming off.  I could not see that there was any benefit at all in using it.  It does not work,1
14485,"Really easy to use, a lot of my friends have bought these based on my hair do's!",4
14486,"Works as designed, a little big, but holds up to pressure of the weight of leg well in shaving process",4
14487,Great blade. It does what it meant to do without any problems. one of the best shavers ever!!!,5
14488,Don't waste your money. It's not worth it. Does not take off hair very well no matter how well you apply it.,1
14489,"Fun had by all.  Game night just got better.  Bingo with a twist, can be played for fun or friendly wager.",5
14490,Not as good as powder for me but its a personal preference.,2
14491,I really did not know how I would like it and now I know I don't. It is uncomfortable and it does not stick correctly.,1
14492,Stiff tubing is a drawback and also that you have to hold the button down to make the water stop flowing. Otherwise a great product.,4
14493,I have a larger hot air brush that I purchased locally. This one doesn't get as hot.,4
14494,"Very good weight to it which was my concern with the price.
But the chain is comes with it is extremely short - only 20-21"".",3

14497,its like putting ben gay in your mouth. so if you like that then youll like this,3
14498,I just don't particularly feel anything different when using the mustard bath.  Different things work for different people.  Yay for individuality!,3
14499,Lighter than expected. Did not expect it to have glitter.,3
14500,I've been using this for a month now and see no difference in it and any other cleanser.,3
14501,The elastic broke after 3 uses. Not worth the money.,1
14502,The only thing i use on the younger boys.  I have used both unscented and coconut.,5

14504,"Came in broken and missing gems, poor quality, rips hair",1
14505,Good pressure settings and design. Like storage feature and rotating spray nozzle. Would have liked a larger reservoir and longer tube feeding nozzle.,3
14506,When package arrived I opened it to fine the makeup leaked everywhere. Not happy.,1
14507,Use it for nails. Works just as well as the little bottles ment for nails that sell for 20 bucks,3
14508,Worked great but a little expensive compared to a local store.,3
14509,"Totally awesome, it dries my hair and style at the same time.",5
14510,The horns do not stay in your hair at all if your hair is down...made me a bit sad cause i was very excited,3
14511,"Wish it lasts a bit longer but overall, it is a nice product.",4
14512,Read the fine print. One out of four pair (random color). Buyer's fault for not reading. Just want others to read carefully.,1
14513,"Lipstick was too long to fit in case.  Measure first.  Thanks to a comment from previous review, I am using one to store Ipod earbuds .",2

14515,My ordered and loves it so guess what I love it if she loves It and if Mama is happy every body is happy!!!!,5

14517,I hate this color. Should have gotten a different one.,1

14520,It's okay but I wouldn't buy it the second time...,3
14521,I will put this as simply as I can. Buy this product only if you enjoy rubbing metal over your body without any hair being cut.,1
14522,The item came fast and I used them right away. I will use them again and again' specialy if the price is right.,5
14523,"disappointed that 15% wasn't enough of a whitening agent, but would buy it again.",3
14524,Good quality lipstick cases... They have a small mirror on the back of the cover...,4
14525,"It is OK, but I would prefer a higher quality case if I can find one. Finding suitable clip on cases for reading glasses is difficult.",3
14526,"does not work at all to the best of my knowledge. Bought 3 bottles, would love to have my money back.",1
14527,"DOES A GOOD JOB,EASY TO CLEAN.THE 7140 TURNS AT MUCH SLOWER RATE THAN MY OLD NORELCO.A BETTER BATTERY IS NEEDED.",3
14528,Perfect light cleanser with a nice fresh lemon feel. Great for the entire family,5

14532,Love the color. Very easy to apply. Great price for what it is.,5

14534,WE LOVE WATERPIK ULTRA FLOSSER IT BEATS USEING THE REGULAR FLOSS STIRPS.,5
14535,Didn't get hot enough to smooth out my hair. I think it might work for someone with short hair though...,2

14537,I only received 9 bowties.  The black bowtie was missing,3
14538,"These are cheap, decent blades, that are good for 2-3 shaves.",4

14540,These shields were too flimsy. Did not sick and bunched up. Will not purchase again.,1

14548,Best product and smell on the market. I have always loved the mix of frankincense and myrth together and it makes a perfect gift Thank-you,5
14549,For looks only I was looking for a sports sleeve this is too thin. If you only looking for looks this will do,3
14550,Nice fragrace...quick delivery. Not sure yet if it does more but has a good overall effect on my mood. Worth trying.,3
14551,"Seriously this Tiara will make you look like a princess. Wonderful, l good quality. I love this product. I recomend to all the brides",5

14555,A little pricey but great for when I have a cold and want to spray it on my pillow. Comforting,4
14556,I've been using the product about a month & looks like it's working.  It might take a little longer because of my age.,4

14563,If you want to smell like an older man with a bit of class this is for you.,4
14564,This is my second one of these.  It does what it says it will do.  Prompt shipping,4

14566,If you wear hearing aids these are great for removing water after a shower.,5
14567,The inhalers are great. The stickers are super cute but do not stay on very well.,4
14568,"It seems to work good.  And it's not too thick for my electric rotary razor, like a few people described it.",4
14569,Such a waste. It only worked once before it died. Was supposed to be good for the shower but I think that is what killed it.,1
14570,I LOVE this stuff. I have dry skin and it provides moisture throughout the whole day.,5
14571,Not as heavily pigmented as Lorac products but a GREAT shadow for aging eyes.,4
14572,I have always enjoyed Norelco products.  These replacement blades are great.  They offer a very close shave and do not cause irritation.,5
14573,"They are not that good, I do not get a close shave with them.",1
14574,Love my wax pot but the plastic cover was broken off.  Can I get another cover?,3
14575,"this works good and i am pleased with it. I got it for my son for christmas and he likes it alot
thanks
donna",4
14576,Terrible was delivered with half of product empty because top of bottle not screwed on tight so product spilled all over bubble wrap!!!,1
14577,Works great. The only reservation is that it does not last long.,4
14578,Make sure you buy the Gigi Wax off with this! The wax is soooo stickey and doesn't not come off with soap and water,3
14579,Smells great! Guys walk up and talk to me non stop! Live it!,4
14580,We ended up sending this back because it did not shave my husband's neck very well.  Other than this I think he thought it was ok.,2
14581,Love this product....works well if you hate flossing the regular way:-),5
14582,"Pretty color, just what I was looking for! :)",4
14583,Just had implants in my lower jaw and Waterpik is the best cleaning tool I have found.  Cannot do without it.,5
14584,"Exactly what the dentist ordered! It is a big improvement over my 10-year old Waterpik, and I'm glad the dentist recommended I update.",5
14585,This mask is very comfortable and relaxing. Its perfect for a spa day at home when you just want to kick back and forget about your worries.,4
14586,Amazing quality for the price. Definitely classes up my bathroom.,5
14587,"No English instructions, small pictures. Could not figure out how to use and make hair look good. It is not like pictured.",1
14588,"Seems to help with pore size, but regular acne seems aggrivated.",3
14589,I am an old hippy who loves all things patchouli.  I even have a bar of this tucked in my dresser drawers!!,5
14590,"I love this stuff, but I could have sworn it's cheaper in-store.",3
14591,"Congratulations, you are using a TRUE razor... and these are the FINEST blades made for it!",5
14592,i got this at discounted price.. it was okay for me ..thanks,4
14593,"Only use this stuff, so it makes sense to buy in bulk. This is almost a 40% discount.",5
14594,Very nice. It looks better in person. I get lots of compliments and will order more.,4
14595,"I wouldn't buy this again just because it's so dang noisy.  Oh, and when tilted sideways, beard trimmings will fall out of it.",3
14596,This is this material but seems good especially for the price. It fits perfectly,5
14597,Aquaphor is the best. It changes the skin practically overnight.,5
14598,"It worked, my sons stopped biting his nails,good product.",5
14599,You get what you pay for here. My expectations were much higher. My fault..,2
14600,I have been used for a period of time. The quality of this product above my expectation. Love it !,5
14601,"Some cream leaked out when I received it. And it's totally no use..
Don't buy it. Waste money..",1
14602,Horrible after tan smell and hard to get the smell to go away even after through washing. Never buy again,1
14603,Was glad Amazon has this.  I don't see it in my grocery anymore.  Smells great and does not bother my ezema.,5
14604,"Didn't really notice that much change, some days it seemed like it was working well... Bought to keep positive climate in workplace.",3
14605,"Some pieces were missing, didn't come with everything like they said it was.",2
14606,I love the smell of this stuff. Would be nice if you didn't need to use so much and it suds upped more.,4
14607,"It dries my hair, doesnt help to reduce dandruff. I have to use very less shampoo nevertheless it dries.. don't know how this got higher ratings",1
14608,Love this eyeshadow!! Glad to have found it here on Amazon!!,5
14609,"The jewelry was satisfactory however it did not arrive on time for me to wear at the event that I purchased it for.

Jackie H.",4
14610,A friend let us borrow his neato to try before we bought our own. As a small token of our gratitude we bought him more filters.,5
14611,"Easy to use and good result if used as instructed .
Would order again.",5
14612,"Cheap for a box of blades, but they don't hold an edge as long as some of the others do.",3
14613,Doesn't really smell all that much! Kinda so so,3
14614,"Good product but beware, these will rip your hair if you aren't gentle. The points are very sharp.",4
14615,Nice assortment of products.  Pricey for what you get.,4
14616,The product exceeded my expectations. It has extra attachments that I hadn't had on previous Waterpik products. It works very well.,5
14617,"A little noisy, but kids enjoy using it & finally they are flossing on their own.",5
14618,This does not have the frizz control that I was looking for.  Seemed watered down or maybe old bottle?,3
14619,It is just what I need to give my fine hair some volume. Glad I got it.,5
14620,I highly recommend this toothbrush. Definitely worth the money.,5
14621,Product is fake... I have the original and compared the two formulas and this is definitely a knock-off,1
14622,The goggles aren't super pliable but a more rigid plastic.  They are doing what they are supposed to do.,4
14623,Purchased this as recommended by my dental hygentist.  Had it a couple of months and so far the only complaint I have is it's very noisy.,4
14624,received product as described. Love it! No regrets what so ever. Will buy again in due time. Thank you for a great deal,5
14625,This is my go-to color & brand!  Love it!,5
14626,not too good only got to use it 1 time it broke the bristles came out,1
14627,Looks cute but never hold the hair very tight at all. It will be loosened after a short time of your use. Disappointed,2
14628,What I received was not 12 different colors instead I received doubles of 6 colors. Terrible quality would definitely not recommend.,1
14629,"For get it. Look for another brand!!!
Deborah",1
14630,"I have used and tried something else, now about to buy again!  Really good, natural coverage!",5
14631,Whether or not it does what it says I'm pouring it out cause the taste is abominable. Dead mint.,1
14632,works well is just what i expected am very pleased with this product and great service. would recommend this item.,4
14633,"If you don't need the bite that those alcohol based antiseptic mouth rinses have, then this fits the bill perfectly.",5
14634,We had to replace our old Waterlpik when the hose broke. We love this one-very easy to use and has replaceable parts.,5
14635,"Razor works fine. Clean,close shave,but relatively loud. Would recommend the product. Gives closer shave than Norelco I owned previously.",4
14636,This is an exceptional blade at a wonderful price point. How an you go wrong? Very pleased/,5
14637,This piece of sheet music arrived in perfect condition. My young vocalist and I are working on it for our next performance.,5
14638,I should have replaced the razor heads long before this.  These new ones were easy to install and the difference is great.,4
14639,The two upward tongs aren't steep enough.  My store bought Gillette razor slides right out.  My Harry's razor kinda fits.,3
14640,I love this. Only thing that works for me with hot flashes.,5
14641,I developed itching in my scalp. If anyone wants dull hair please continue using it. I got a lot of dandruf in my scalp.,1
14642,I love this product its one of the few that really does stay on all day.  BUT the color didn't match the picture.,3
14643,"Good for travel, but I prefer the block version because it's quicker to use with more surface area.",4
14644,Scent and formula changed. Will not use the product anymore. Very unhappy with purchase.,1
14645,I have a makeup mirror and the light burned out.  I ordered these bulbs and now works again like new.,5
14646,"these things are so tiny!! the quality is nediocre, but what do you expect with the price?",4
14647,"Not too thick or too thin, holds moisture in without being too hot. Feel good.",4
14648,Was delivered to me already tarnished. Not sure if I can even wear this because the tarnish on the leaf cannot be hidden.,2
14649,This item does NOT heat up to more than tepid.  It is totally useless.  I would not recommend this at all.,1
14650,"Simply cheap, Inferior blades. Do not shave well. Go for better quality.  Merkur or other Safety razor blades are far superior.",1
14651,A piece broke on this unit. Water gets all over the counter.,3
14652,Be careful when warning was in container. If it gets too hot it will melt jar. Otherwise great product,4
14653,Got this is a sunscreen under my make up. It has no fragrance and goes on the light. I really like it,5
14654,This is a great grooming kit for men.  I am only concerned about the durability of this product!  I have not had success in the past.,5
14655,working great!!! pouch exist but not exist blade protection cap.,4
14656,It came with the Body Wash so we got it.  Not sure what is is used for and it smells funny.,1
14657,it developed a pin hole in the hose after less than a year in use - Waterpik needs to address this problem,3
14658,I don't think this is an authentic product. It had two different labels from two different companies on it. May be counterfeit.,2
14659,Have used for a long time and nothing has worked better. This is a winner and I will continue to purchase it.,5
14660,This is a basic handle but it gets the job done. I have never had one break. It comes with a great no-slip ergonomic feel.,4
14661,I returned it. Given 3 since its a neutral rating. It was not of much use to me. So returned it.,3
14662,Loved it and would love to but some more but just to expensive..,5
14663,"They're  ok , I have typed thin hair so it looks good in a pony tail",3
14664,"Isn't quite the color shown here, but still a good fall color.",4
14665,"The cool function already broke, and now the hair dry gets insanely hot.",1
14666,It was the worst product i ever ordered.pic was way nicer then the acual nise rings.veryunhappy,1
14667,ITS OKAY THE SMELL IS WEIRD UNTIL YOU GET USE TO IT,3
14668,Very pleased. Nice product for excellent price. Thank you.,4
14669,Only one pair thought it was for 4 pair rip off. Pink too not my color.,2
14670,Love the product does it come in a plastic container.,5
14671,The oils smell so good. I can not stop smelling myself.. As weird as that sounds. Will be ordering more as soon as I run out!,5
14672,Nice brush. I like the gel handle a lot.,4
14673,Very good shaver with only two flaws. Noisy and bulky. It's still a gem compared to Braun for the price.,4
14674,Excited to try this. Have really liked other OZNaturals products. Thanks for the offer!,4
14675,I have 3c/4a hair. It made my hair feel and look very dry. I didn't like it at all.,1
14676,Quite bulky and a little uncomfortable. I would not buy it again.,3
14677,Very dark berry color.  Dries out your lips pretty quickly,3
14678,"Smells great, tones well, but doesn't clear the acne I have as well as I thought.",4
14679,"My condition remains the same there was no improvement , i bought this to help with my friboids and painful periods but did not help in anyway",2
14680,Smell not good smelled awefull and was chunky when I received it,1
14681,"Good for mild whitening, does not leave burning feeling.",4
14682,It's texture was really great and I loved the sound.,5
14683,"I think using this product will require lots of practice - it's hard to control the amount of product
when spraying it on your roots.",3
14684,"It's opened and just half bottle!
BE WARE!",1
14685,"Not quite as powerful as the older models, but the extra attachments make it a good value. Resevoir could be bigger",4
14686,i did not like them but thats what you get for $3 bucks.,1
14687,I wore them twice and then the lense popped out.,1
14688,did not work at all for skin conditions...plus has a weird smell.,2
14689,"Terrible, could not get it to support and weight.",1
14690,Doesn't clean your hair of minerals after a while.,1
14691,"Nice , real soap! Smells delightful.
Clean & chemical free.",5
14692,They are way to tight. They poked holes in the skin after having on for a little while.,3
14693,Decent quality for price--doesn't change color of skin or cause reaction,4
14694,"Works well. Does the job. I forgot that I prefer waterproof trimmers so I'll get one of those next time, but this is good.",4
14695,I love this Necklace but the chain is a little short!,4
14696,Made out of plastic and looks pretty cheaply made :/ and to make matters worse I bought this as a gift....,2
14697,Fun trendy rosy brown color but it is a little drying.,4
14698,"I used it for about a week just to greasy, and didn't do anything.  Sorry bad product.",1
14699,I am a cancer patient and have a problem shaving but these let me cleab up with little fuss.,5
14700,smells horrible but if it keeps really repels lice then I don't care how it smells.,4

14702,The top guard is held in place by two very weak plastic clips and mine broke as I placed the guard on for the first time.,1
14703,"I really love this stuff.  It gets him nice and clean without irritating his skin, plus it smells good to boot!",5
14704,Does what its advertised to do.  Cleans and conditions hair better than separate products.  And gets the body clean and refreshed.  Saves time.,4
14705,"Been using this for a few years, love the shiny glitter in it! Great product!",5
14706,This hot air according to my wife is fantastic. She had me order another one just like it.,5
14707,"the rechargeable battery last long when it is in use.
lightweight easy to use in the hard to reach space",4
14708,A little soon to rate but so far all is well with this product.,4
14709,It took forever for the shipping and it is so dull it doesn't even cut.  Don't waste your time and money.,1
14710,Very nice cup but was damaged. I returned it.,1
14711,"I love love love it, my mouth is already healthier!",5
14712,Did not work for me. I finished 1 bottle and say no difference,1
14713,"Works Great.
My skin is more radiant and hydrated. I also noticed that it evened out my skin tone.
Very satisfied with my purchase.",4
14714,Purchased but made my hair feel weird and I just didn't like it. Maybe I did it all wrong.,3
14715,"I thought my original water pik was more powerful.  This one, although more compact, does not clean as well.  I was disappointed.",2
14716,"Nice looking and nice fitting sleeves. They will start to form to your cards, so if they are bent they will bend.",4
14717,This is my go to salve for everything. I have been using this since childhood!,5
14718,I like it that it sanitizes the toothbrush part.  The toothbrush just vibrates and I'm disappointed with how it works.,3
14719,"I've owned two of these. They worked great for about a year, then a plastic washer fails inside the wand and water sprays everywhere.",3
14720,"it makes my skin feel softer and no irritations, no bad smell !",4
14721,not what i thought did not like the texture. No sure if it was real or not. taking it out already.,2
14722,"Very good.  Useful, handy.  washable.  Nice.",5

It leaves my hair feeling very clean!",5
14724,Great colors! very sticky though. I still love it,4
14725,It does last long. But I wish it wouldn't dry when I put it on.,4
14726,I like this. Its a nice warm weather aftershave because it cools while soothing your shaved skin.,4
14727,Not a whole lot of power but being used for wig so I guess it's alright,4
14728,These pads were tiny... not worth the money I paid....misleading advertising,1
14729,Barely any scent. And it doesn't smell like a lavender. I don't like it.,2
14730,"The only thing I didn't like about it is it doesn't tell you how to clean the brush, but that's it.",4
14731,"It is a lightweight tool, which great water pressure to clean out even the most stubborn piece of food. It works quite well to remove plaque!",4
14732,Fell apart after about 5 uses. The knot came unglued from the metal piece that holds it in. Please do not waste your time with this.,1
14733,too many bells $ whistles . . . and less pressure than earlier models.  Not worth the price ov over $50,2
14734,Takes a couple times to get used to. Sprayed my mirror a couple times,3
14735,When I use itthe pungent odor of the hairdrier let me feel bad,3
14736,$65 for one bottles of soap!! Do NOT use this sight unless you are very wealthy!,5
14737,"I have no need to write with pink, purple or green ink.  Blue is OK, but Black is the best.",4
14738,"Was very disappointed to see that upon arrival, these massage oils contain nut oils which are a common allergen. Wish they had a different ingredients list.",2
14739,it's ok - the scent disappears from the tube after a few weeks.,3
14740,Product great! Seemed a little pricy. Have been buying 2.5 oz tube at supermarket for $6.99.,5
14741,The sizes could have been varied a little more but other than that love em,4
14742,My husband said they did not work at all! Said it did not give a close shave like it should!,2
14743,Love the different sticker choices and the quadrant timer.  Seems to make brushing fun.  Teeth feel really clean when using a Sonicare.,5
14744,"did not see any difference after using for 2.5 weeks

Disclosure: I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.",2
14745,Love it!! I have very fair skin and it is the perfect color!,5
14746,"Don't buy it. It doesn't work at all.
don't waist ur money.
I bought it and it doesn't work at all.",1
14747,What can I say. Waterpic is the best tool I've used for my gums and teeth.,5
14748,"I haven't been able to use these yet, but I plan to soon. they are very cute and they stay put (that's important)",5
14749,Much thinner than expected but still good buy for price. Reasonable and must to have on hand in emergancy supplies.,2
14750,Cheaper at any Whole Foods or Earth Fare..  and stores like that... ussually buy it for $4 a bar.,4
14751,I hate to floss I find this much more refreshing and less stressful on your gums.  It works very well.,5
14752,It was okay not much glitter stays on the eyelashes. It just makes them all clamp together not what I expected,1
14753,The button on the wand stopped working last month so now it is useless!,1
14754,It broke the first time I wore it!! I do not recommend this bracelet unless your not going to wear it.,2
14755,My wife loves the village naturals. She like how it feels after her bath and really likes the price.,4
14756,I love this lipstick! It goes on very smoothly and the color is very flattering. This is a great product for it's price!,4
14757,Update! I am finally seeing results from this product. Will purchase again. Amazing customer service!,4
14758,i usually buy this at my preferred stores  always expensive but this time approximately half even after shipping  a win for me!!,5
14759,Works fine. Does what it's supposed to do.,4
14760,Does its job. The bristles part came out but was super ez to put bk in great for wigs,4
14761,"This is a really great item, my husband and I both use it. It does what it was says it does.",5
14762,"Very tight, like for a child, and not good quality. It should be in the dollar store. I threw it in the trash.",1
14763,I have this brush in the larger size as well it works well with my long thin fine hair. Much easier to use than a curling iron.,5
14764,Pretty colors/design on a simple but nice case that makes it easy to find lipstick that usually hides in corner of the zippered compartment.,5
14765,"Just the thing for a lighted mirror.  Mine is one of those touch control models, with the 3 levels of brightness.  Works great.",5
14766,"The cream has a very nice, light texture and scent. I always want to have this available in wintertime for dry hands and feet.",5
14767,Very good moneys worth easy to use and it works it really cleaned the gums and removed Tatar from them,5
14768,It doesn't fit any brush. Be careful on brush sizes its not one size fits all.,1
14769,Looks nice and holds shaving brush but does not hold razor,4
14770,I got the incorrect blades and I didn't even get the correct number. I received 50 personna blades instead of 100 astra. I am very disappointed,1
14771,Nice but it stretches out and becomes translucent. Image looks washed out.,3
14772,Great item but you have to be very careful when using it!  Works well and runs quietly  I RECOMMEND IT!,4
14773,They're a bit thinner than expected and two came broken. they look cool but I suggest you buy two sets of them just in case,3
14774,I really like the bubble bath it makes. Just too expensive. Smells clean and fresh without an overwhelming perfumed scent.,4
14775,"The scent wasn't quite what I was expecting, but it is definitely a high quality product.",4
14776,I wasn't that fond of the selection and I had two repeats and about 4 with the same design in different colors,2
14777,They charged me and I not received the item yet on top of that they start playing blame game putting things on UPS.,1
14778,I ordered these and it took a month and a half and it gave me all 5 blue like not worth it. ,1
14779,The smell is a bit off putting and the beads are soft so they don't feel like they are exfoliating as much as I expected.,3
14780,"Buy a couple of these every year, and love them.",5
14781,this item was a necessary for taking in the camper.  it makes it very easy to clean up after fishing and hunting.,4
14782,They are cute nice colors buy i only received 10pcs in my order and it says 20pcs!!!,2
14783,"Horrible texture, applicator and color. Looks like play makeup for children. Will not buy again.",1
14784,It doesn't get as close as my old one. Otherwise it works good. That's all I have to say about it.,4
14785,"Great product, smells delicious, works great for me for flyaway hair and at the ends of my hair",4
14786,Bought this for my cruise and vacation.  Love it...it has just the right amount of pockets and zippers and holds all my necessityies.,5
14787,"Works as expected, a bargain in the multi pack.",5
14788,"The product matched expectations. And the deadline was met.
I recommend this store to all",5
14789,"Been using this soap for years.... The smell was not the same ...will not purchase it again online
Except direct from Plantlife ;((",1
14790,I was not happy with the color and it doesn't stay on very long has to be reapplied way too often.,3
14791,Excellent product!  Received in good time.  Thank you!,5
14792,"OUCH!!!!  Not good for sensitive areas. It nips the skin.  Otherwise it is a great, sturdy product.",3
14793,I tried many times but this didn't stay up in the tile wall of my bathtub :( very disappointed,1
14794,"This is a very good product and good buy, but I wish Waterpik would include more than one standard pik with the product.",4
14795,Leaves my gray hair soft and shiny with no brassy look .,4
14796,"Wouldn't buy this pump spray bottle again...too awkward to use.  Would prefer a pump lotion.  Nice, mild fragrance, though!",2
14797,"unfortunately, it does not work for me. have not used it, don't know what to do with it as it is passed return day.",2
14798,"These razors arrived quickly, intact, and less expensive than if I went to the store. Thanks.",5
14799,Huge Joke!!!! I totally wasted my money purchasing this!,1
14800,Good brushes but not the best.  Packaging is cute but not high end but great brushes for the price point.,4
14801,"It keeps my bald head warm in the house, loose fit better than knit cap.",5
14802,The product came on time and I like it. I only wish I could have bought it a lower price,4
14803,I bought this for a relative and it worked very well on her.,4
14804,The color is more toward the nude side than pink.,3
14805,I have not used it long enough to give you any review other than the smell is pleasant. I wish it was in other scents as well.,4
14806,"Completely misleading bogus!! I hoped for a balsam product. There is none in this product so the name is misleading.
Not happy.",1
14807,"This product works.  So sad how another ""breath mint"" company used dubious litigation tactics to put this company out of business.",5
14808,"arrived damaged leaking
should get a brand new one for free",1
14809,Works like a charm just thought it would be more of it!,4
14810,It's a little tippy. The brush holder does not fit all brushes,3
14811,I was not as satisfied with this product as I had hoped. If I put the pressure higher than 2 it is hard to control.,3
14812,I don't know if it works but it feels nice on my skin,4
14813,I have the Waterpik for about 1.5 year before final stop working. The product is not reliable as the old model.,2
14814,"my grandchildren loved the nail gems and I'm giving some to my sister who loves
to have her nails polished and decorated.",5
14815,"Nice item, well-built.  Very Practical way to store your razor.",4
14816,"I've used this product for years and love it. For some reason this batch is skunky, not fresh.",2
14817,I like the product. Doesn't save time but works well.,4
14818,This product does not hold enough water to do a good job of flossing.  It is empty before the job is 1/2 completed.,2
14819,As others have said- Leaked in box. Returned immediately. Bad lid for shipping.,2
14820,THE RAZOR IS SO QUIET I CAN SHAVE WITH MY HEARING AIDS IN GREAT FOR ALL WHO WEAR HEARING AIDS AND FOR THOSE WHO DO NOT,4
14821,"Meh, worked for a few but didn't last as long as I thought",2
14822,Hate Hate the smell and not a very good lotion either,1
14823,"Everything arrived in perfect condition and on time, very happy. A++++
My son's teeth sparkle and he enjoys using these brushes.
Thank you.",4
14824,Ok for holding soap but a deeper bowl is a better idea.,4
14825,Hard to get on but very comfortable. Can wear all day without tugging or pulling,4
14826,I think this product is good because I never heard any complains from my husband since he started using it.,4
14827,"Sending back. They look small, like for a child's foot.  Holes are all small and close together.",1
14828,"Compared to the Genie bra purchased in the US, this one has lighter fabric.",4
14829,"Does not live up to the promise of healthy, strong and growing hair.",2
14830,Excellent product. Very enjoyable. Have made it to 9/10 mm. 10 is still tight.,5
14831,It really works! This gotta be black magic mixed with voodoo water and chicken cum.,5
14832,These covers were perfect for my kids. They are a basic cover and very easy for my kids to get the tablets in.,4
14833,I really don't see any changes using this product. I think that the trays work better.,2
14834,Didn't like this. The smell and texture were fine but it ended up feeling a little too greasy for my liking.,1
14835,Great coverage the only thing is the consistency  a little thick,4
14836,This product works vey well. I found it easy to figure out and easy to use. The power level is good.,4
14837,"Perfect touch of color, and I love how easily it layers and blends whether I'm wearing foundation or just moisturizer",5
14838,Dentist gave me these to try. I am glad they were free because they didn't help me one bit.,1
14839,I didn't see a improvement on my gum recession like all my research said I would. But fast shipping,3
14840,Loved it until it broke down after only 6 months!,1
14841,Don't like it. Does not stick well to lips. Smudgy to apply.,1
14842,"One item, not 4. Returning for a refund.",1
14843,"Comfortable,  soft, just can't find it on time! lol",4
14844,"Oh, how I love this powder! But I just have to say...it doesn't have quite the same smell that it used to.",4
14845,They shrank and are now just a tad small so I probably won't be able to use them.  Wouldn't buy again.,2
14846,This product is awesome...I will purchase it again in the future!,5
14847,I ordered for someone else not sure but I guess it was what she wanted,4
14848,Zilactin L liquid form is the best. cannot find anywhere.,3
14849,"It helps me sleep better because my hair isn't getting caught below me when I turn over. Sometimes it falls off, though.",4
14850,Thick fragrant cleanser with an interesting cooling sensation.  Pretty good price here.,4
14851,I can kiss my baby with this on and make out with my husband. It's awesome! ,5
14852,You will never know whether this product is good or not because it just doesn't come out of the bottle,1
14853,color is more of a tannish color than a purplish pink like the photo shows,2
14854,It's taking forever  .... I will never purchase nothing from them any more I feel like they just stole my money this after almost a month,1
14855,Absolute waste of money on these blades.  Can not even get one decent shave with one of these blades.  Spend your money on another brand.,1
14856,Helpful in keeping razor burn under control and nice for summer months! Lasts a while. Doesn't burn.,5
14857,"Horrible!
It made so much noise it could damage one's hearing. It was definitely made on the cheap. Returned it immediately.",1
14858,when it came i thought it would be soft....but the bristles were really harsh....the powder brush just started to fall apart,1
14859,I like their products but I'm not crazy about this one.  I won't order any more of it to use.,3
14860,harsh on my skin though i have normal not sensetive skin . i use it not on a daily basis,3
14861,"The brushes seem a bit rough, so I don't use the eyeshadow applicator, I only use the eyebrow brush and the blush brushes.",3
14862,Too bulky and not enough heat to do the job.  I was expecting it to be more like what was advertised.  Very disappointed.,2
14863,"Not bad, I'll probably just use the large one though",4
14864,Does not heat up as well as I hoped.  Used it a couple of times.,3
14865,Very happy with this product.  I've been using raw black soap for years and this product is of the same great quality I'm use to.,4
14866,Came melted. Get the cocoa butter spray lotion instead.,1
14867,This is easy to use and not as messy as the alternatives out there. I'd buy it again.,4
14868,Nice scent. I haven't been using it very long. I wish it was more emollient for mature skin like mine.,4
14869,"Drying, chapping, hard to apply evenly as it is so dry. Bleeds an orange-y color into fine lines. Not worth even this low price.",1
14870,The nail oil is equal to other brands I have  bought,3
14871,"After a few washes of the powder puff, it loses its softness (which is expected). Love it for applying powder though",4
14872,Not what I expected for the price.  Cheaply made.,2
14873,MY PET LICE DID NOT LIKE IT.. IT MADE THEIR HAIR ALL FUZZY,2
14874,"Was disappointed in this product,  didn't work as well as I thought it would",1
14875,Looks good and works well.  Sometimes my razor will not stay balanced.  Great for my shaving brush.,4
14876,"Decent stuff.  I have no complaints, but no raves either.  It'll work for vaping, but better options exist.",3
14877,Save your money and get one of those Venus Bikini Shaver kits that comes with razors.,2
14878,I thought it also contained soap- did not need another dish but the wood is nice,2
14879,Smells like the incense which I love but its mostly just cheap oil with some added fragrance so I use a little only on my legs and feet.,3
14880,Better quality than I expected...Great gift for your Barber,5
14881,"This razor is not good to my knowledge.

It is not giving close shave.  Particularly in the neck.  I started to continue with my Mach3.",1
14882,It's incomplete set because you have to purchase additional materials to use it,3
14883,event though you don't see dramatic results for weeks.  your skin feel much softer  and smoother.  i am now using them more ofeten,4
14884,Tube felt empty. I do like the product how ER.,4
14885,Great product. The wrinkles on my face have softened quite a bit. I will be buying more.,5
14886,Nice and delicious! Smells like chocolate and can keep my lips moisture. I've already recommended it to everybody around me.,5
14887,I'm not a fan of the grainy texture of the new orajel pain relievers. Seems to have changed over the years.,2
14888,Does not even heat up. Glad I only paid like $3 for it.,1
14889,It really doesn't hold that good and it left spots on my clothes.,1
14890,Having been using this 3 years. It's removed my dark spots. Be sure to use with sunscreen to prevent spots from returning.,4
14891,Conceals the gray well and is easy to apply. I would buy this again.,4
14892,"Love smell
I usually order yellow bottle but this has a diff smell and no talc",5
14893,It took 6-8 weeks to work. Works on mild to moderate acne. Would recommend to others. Will Buy again. Good,4
14894,Veil was gorgeous and fell beautifully when placed on the head. My daughter loved it!,5
14895,"This is a gross, shiny brown color. I thought it would have more pinkish undertones.",1
14896,I have been looking for these for a long time. They keep my hair up neatly. Going to order more,4
14897,I received this free from bzzagent. I tried this product and it seemed to help.  I was able to eat ice-cream without  looking funny.,3
14898,"This is a great color pallet, especially for this fall, and easy to use.",4
14899,These were as described. The only negative was that they came all mixed up but other than that it was ok.,3
14900,not to happy with this product it is to fry and hard to manage,3
14901,The price was much better buying it on line and my dentist thinks using it daily has been very helpful.,4
14902,I had this on my whisk list and shaved money by buying it on sale.,4
14903,"Had this for a few months and its already broken. Wont turn on at all, put new batteries in, nothing. Waste of money.",1
14904,"This is not blue,is more like green . I waist my money. I am not happy",1
14905,Absolutley love this moisturizer.  I have extremely dry skin and this has really helped.  Love the Perricone MD products.,4
14906,"I took it out of the package,  tried to clip it on my necklace and the clasp broke.",1
14907,"I mean, look at it... do you want it? If you said yes buy it",4
14908,"i liked them,only one thing they are a little thin but maybe once the acrylic is on they'll look nice :)",4
14909,The vitamin C clogs your pores. I have never had so many black heads until I started using this.,1
14910,"It smells pretty good, but nothing close to the really nice fragrance normally associated with Sandalwood. I'm using it. But won't buy again.",2
14911,"WHAT MORE CAN I SAY, I LOVE IT.  It helps remove particles that ar emissed with flossing.",5
14912,"Not that great. Razor slips out and the brush stays on sometime. It feels solid though, not some cheap plastic thing.",3
14913,"Worked for 30 days, then lost its adhesiveness.  Too much money for too little use.  Was unable to return it and get money back.",2
14914,"This serum dries quickly, which is great to put on before make up.  It leaves skin feeling tighter and moisturized.",5
14915,Much much smaller than expected !! Way over priced. Be lucky if 1 is enough for 1 use,2
14916,It came with the Body Wash so we got it.  Not sure what is is used for and it smells funny.,1
14917,it makes the hair very crunchy. it lasts for 2 days. not what I was looking for.,3
14918,I used these with a stamper and they are okay.  Better than trying to use regular polish.,4
14919,"This was a gift for a close friend, but I haven't heard yet how it was received.  I'll report again after I hear something.",4
14920,"Nice mineral makeup, works well great shades and coverage. Great sample set.",4
14921,Some gems fell off the studs. But great deal for so many pieces.,3
14922,"I bought this to hold homemade makeup, such as foundation. It doesnt pump after three days, i have to turn it upside down, very disappointing",2
14923,Didn't work at all. Either burnt out or never worked. Had to return for refund.,1
14924,This product is misleading. It says alcohol free yet alcohol is listed in the ingredients. I put it in the rubbish.,1
14925,I use this product for years. And I never had problems with the purchase.,5
14926,"Product arrived on time and is great; however, it was packed too tightly so several forms were ruined and unusable.",4
14927,product and packaging musty; package looked like it had already been open.  item not returnable.  regret this purchase.,2
14928,I've been taking it for a month and it has not made any difference.,1
14929,I threw the bottle away after the first few applications due to eye irritation and headaches.  Did not work out for me.,1
14930,Love reed and barton.  This is a Christmas gift for my daughter.,5
14931,"I liked the product, until it broke now. I think this is not waterproof.",2
14932,"SUPERB product here. The problem I encountered is after 8 months the waterpik refuses to start. Nothing has changed either.

Therefore...3 stars.",3
14933,"Cheap, no shine, and tiny. Like the size of a pen tip. I used them for a phone case and OMG hard to work with",3
14934,Too dark for light brown hair - this is for dark to medium brown,2
14935,the thing at the bottom that's supposed to go up wouldn't. Will buy another one to see if same thing happens again.,1
14936,"sure it looks cute,made out of paper and glue and does not stay in place. don't waste your time or money!!",1
14937,Smells nice. I would have liked something with more 'sting' but this is okay.,4
14938,I love this brand they always have good products. My dentist said he saw a big improvement in my gums and flossing!,5
14939,The blade does it's job but once the actual blade is inserted it's flimsy while your using fix the problem,1
14940,WORKS GREAT I HAVE USED IT FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS  IT REALLY HELPS GET A BETTER SHAVE.,4
14941,"I love this floss. It doesn't get stuck between my tight teeth.  Knocked off one star for the price only.  Otherwise, Great Floss!",4
14942,Bought this because the oriignal Lever with Aloe was discontinued. Has a mild scent and isn't hard on the skin.,4
14943,Not as good as the first one I ordered!!  Lost its stickiness quick!  I feel like I lost my money!,1
14944,"Wate of money, I bought that thinking the size will be big enough to fit into my palms but did not. Will not recommend it.",1
14945,This is a wonderful product and it was shipped on time.,5
14946,not as good as it use to be bought in the store,1
14947,"I like how this works,I have to use with more then once to get it to work right but it does work.",4
14948,"I love this for my lips, to keep from cracking and dryness. I apply every night!",5
14949,"This soap smells pretty rosey- in a nice, not too old lady way.  Pretty sure its done nothing to tighten things up tho",4
14950,This smells so good. I use it as a toner for my face.,4
14951,no significant difference...it's a nice feeling cream though,3
14952,"A really hard spray, have to use a lot to get it to work, then it sprays on scalp. Might try powder next time.",2
14953,Trimming is not close Cut. Also it pulls the hair,2
14954,They're usable but not great quality. .just ok .,3
14955,Love this product! I use as a night cream and wake up with a soft refreshed feeling.,5
14956,They are so small that they are for no your nose waste of money,1
14957,"I bought this for my son, and it gave him a nasty rash all over his hairline when I sprayed it. Not helpful.",1
14958,I must have waited too long for this product to work on me,1
14959,Easy to use. Short time to recharge the baterie. Long life batery and it is appropriate o sensitive skin.,4
14960,I just used the product so i cnt really rate the product yet..,1
14961,Received the folding comb twice when attempting to order this comb. Inventory is not correct for this item.,1
14962,"Good smell, works ok. I must have desert dry cuticles...",4
14963,So nice to not smell of chlorine after swimming.  Skin feels great.,5
14964,The scent is OK. would prefer something not so fruity. Seems to run out fairly quick. I would prefer a body spray instead of an areosole.,3
14965,Worst tasting mouthwash ever. This stuff is just awful.,1
14966,I will use this stuff forever! Takes the pain and frustration away from friction caused by my thighs rubbing together.,5
14967,The gentleman I bought it for really likes it. It gives a great shave and is always charged and ready to go.,4
14968,They did not work with the top that I bought.,3
14969,"They were as advertised, and I will be ordering more. Great buy!",4
14970,"Very firm, doesn't come with nails like stated not good for state boards",2
14971,"Very oily but makes skin feel soft so i only use it at night, great product though.",4
14972,The thread in this pack is nice and thick.  The needles are thin and cheap.,3
14973,I like product but when ordered I received .75 oz. tube instead of 1 oz. pump.,4
14974,These are great and work like a charm! They do have a bad taste after the 30 minute mark but so goes the price of fabulous!,5
14975,"Pro:  No flavoring is added.
Con:  I like the one that comes in a cylinder better,
  because it is easier to use.",4
14976,it arrived and it couldn't even use it because it was defected and the ball wouldn't screw off.,2
14977,"Works and good, accidentally ordered two and glad I did as one was broken.",4
14978,Kind of bought as a joke. Thought it was something I should have invented. But haven't used,1
14979,I bought this thinking their was going to be a change and their wasn't I am so not happy,1
14980,"It does a good job.  I am not a fan of the wand and the tubing, but other than it's great.",4
14981,Got my case quicker than delivery date... The only problem i am having is the clips slide off making my tablet shift and slide,3
14982,Have been using for about 2 weeks and haven't noticed too much of a difference.,3
14983,I really like the shampoo and body wash. They both lather great with a very masculine yet fruity scent. 3 thumbs up!,5
14984,Bars are super short. Balls break and snap in half after awhile. I kept them for back up balls but eventually ran out.,1
14985,"sorry i buy this product not for me, i buy for  my friend, but i think my friend is happy",4
14986,not quite the size I was expecting but made a great gift,4
14987,"Nothing keeps the boys as fresh as Fresh Balls! Easy apply,lasts,my woman appreciates the non man smell,oh yeah! Get it",5
14988,Works well.  Not 5 stars because the batteries could last a little longer.,4
14989,This is my favorite tea tree oil. I always find myself repurchasing it.,5
14990,"They cut well, but not as sharp as my 8 year old originals. Still, they do a good job.",4
14991,I use this as an under eye neutralizing base under liquid concealer. works great.,4
14992,Fast shipping but they are very thin we will have to use 2 for every client so they will feel covered.,3
14993,Amazingly helpful for tooth sensitivity. Use every day religiously. Haven't seen a dentist in years. LOVE this thing.,5
14994,It doesn't get hot enough and tangles in even short hair. There is no curl effect as it does not get hot.,1
14995,"I liked that they are flexible, but you cannot see anything at all.",2
14996,"Really nice product, only need a little for nice results",4
14997,It leaked when it arrived. Horrible smell. No response from OZnatural after sending them a couple of emails. Dont waste your money,1
14998,So far I have enjoyed the Waterpik it seems to operate as it should no complaints so I would recommand it,4
14999,Bought these for my mother in law who loves doing her nails and all her grandkids nails. She loves them!,4
15000,The larger sized sound are to big. I wish these went up in 1/2 increments. 1mm does not sound like much until you try it.,4
15001,"Paint chipping off the metal, a larger-than-expected, overall horrible product. I wouldn't recommend people buying it.",1
15002,Liking the results didn't think I would like product but just gave it a five star review,5
15003,Really works smoothing out creases while sleep... I use every night.... But loses its adhesive after a short time,4
15004,Open the package and notice a hole near the band for 5 bucks I expected  more,1
15005,"My husband has gone through two of these. It doesn't hold a charge, and breaks quickly. A piece of junk.",1
15006,I am always a Philips razor fun. This one is a gift to my father-in-law. Everything looks good except the look is weired.,4
15007,Although we are still using this water pik - it is not as powerful as the model we owned before.,4
15008,Harder to use than expected and not impressed with results.  Would not buy again.,3
15009,"Too small for anyone with a lot of hair, always comes off during the night.",2
15010,"They fit weird and I don't feel like the dark part is dark enough, is still very bright with them on",3
15011,I have bought other body creamers that didn't last very long. This one is more substantial and I expect it will last longer.,5
15012,"beautiful, simple. Only down side is the rotation of the stand is too easy so it is easy to accidentally drop your razor from it.",3
15013,I have used this product for 30+ days & the fine lines have not dimished.,1
15014,"Looks just like ""Elsa's"" hair.  My daughter wanted all of us to be characters from the movie for Halloween; this was perfect!",5
15015,Not the original Super Hit. Cones don't burn right. Buy sticks better.,1
15016,they stretch the first time u use them. u might as well buy the 99 ones.,1
15017,"Use it everyday, works great and that solved my gum bleeds.",4
15018,"very good product for oily skin, it reduces the clogs in my skin.",4
15019,was bummed by the quality but its super cute and fits great.,3
15020,1 star because it is not the size i needed.,1
15021,This is a great toothbrush. It is fairly priced and has quite durable bristles. Great product. I highly recommend this toothbrush.,4
15022,BUYER BEWARE people may confuse you for a delicious almond cookie!,5
15023,"Not the best tape, but it does the job--Hard to handle when trying to make it work.",3
15024,Did not hold dentures in place at all.  Gooey and came out no matter what I did.  Made me cough and gag.,1
15025,Wish it could be bought in stores and wish it were a little more affordiable.,4
15026,"Thank you for the great assistance and support! Way to go Poppy Austin team! Satisfied here. Love, love, love, love it!",4
15027,"A pretty solid and inexpensive shave. They last 3-4 shaves, generally. There are better blades out there, but they're not worth the cost.",4
15028,"Very thin and sheds a lot, nice cap construction and wave pattern",4
15029,The blades do a fine job and the handle is fine too.  The price for both of these products is too high.,3
15030,"Great vest, but runs small. I had to return it. Order 1 size up.",4
15031,I DON;T THINK THIS PRODUCT IS ANY BETTER THAN ONE I COULD BUY FOR LESS OTC.,2
15032,rubber and wouldn't fit on toe. not a solid piece.,1
15033,"What's the rationale not showing the ingredients and the complete image of the product? I may have liked the product, now I hate it.",1
15034,For the price it give alot variety to help the person select what is the best color combination for them or even help create a new combination,5
15035,Haven't found a waterpik yet that lasted more than a year. Too bad they don't make a product that lasts.,3
15036,"Did not come with instructions for installing, so I ended up a greasy mess because I had to figure it out. Very frustrating.",2
15037,I have an oily skin and these products help control oil all thought the day,4
15038,Like it very much...much more confident with all in one...easy to use...seems to do the job.,5
15039,Makes our skin beautiful fresh smelling. And so smooth. LOVE IT,5
15040,"these are good blades, better, sharper than danby/derby whatever they are",4
15041,Only tried once so far...but seemed to stick and washes off your skin easily.,4
15042,my doctor and hospital recommended this product.  no rashes or skin irritation.  sorry it does not come in a larger quantity,5
15043,"The palette it's small, but for now the concealers are working more that fine for me.",4
15044,Works good for those with oily skin and that sweat a lot in their heads,5
15045,"Item fits good and looks good
Wish that there was a better selection of color like black one red is ok",5
15046,"It's not as bubbly as the other Shea moisture baby wash, so I prefer the other one.",4
15047,so loving the colors and i have yet to learn whitch brush is for what. cant wait to actually use it,3
15048,Honestly it smells  good but it doesn't work. i prefer to go dry; with a wet and dry electronic shaver.,2
15049,Works marvelously. Great product. It would be perfect if I could use it after my girlfriend went to bed without waking her up.,4
15050,Does a great job but a little expensive-probably the container.,4
15051,"This product does exactly what it says; it thoroughly cleans the skin down to the pores, it makes the skin smooth and it reduce blemishes.",4
15052,I love this stuff clears skin and leaves a healthy fresh glow,5
15053,The color is pretty. It doesn't stay on for a long time though.,4
15054,It looks as if the box had been opened before and is missing 2 out of the 10 strips. Very disappointing.,2
15055,Great product. I couldn't be more happier with io,5
15056,Recommended by my son's dentist. He now loves brushing his teeth and we don't have to constantly tell him to brush longer,5
15057,I like the small white and blues ones better than the big all blue. I think there should be more smalls toothbrush in the pack.,3
15058,These did not have the red scrubby side they had the grey one and the grey one sucks. Not very good at exfoliating.,3
15059,it is alright. similar to what u get in a lower end hotel. i was expecting more and would not pay for this.,3
15060,I like this product. Second time I have purchased it.,4
15061,Some brushes are good some of the brushes are made of really cheap material but for $20 I didn't expect something outstanding,3
15062,"Only works if it's full, so isn't what I was looking for.",2
15063,"Does what I need it to, looks nice and holds my shaving gear.",4
15064,"Inexpensive an functional. Wish they offered a left and right angle, would be better.",4
15065,"It's an ok trimmer, nothing bad per say, wish it had a bit more vacuum.  Very adaptable and easy to use.",4
15066,Best invention in the past few years to help hide bald spots!!!,5
15067,The tape did not hold at all. It's very hard to peel the backing off. I was very disappointed.,1
15068,I bought this as part of Amazon's Subscribe and save and it is a good product. Good floss and cleans my teeth well!,5
15069,"As usual the product worked fine,  I have never been disappointed by a product received from Amazon.",4
15070,"Oh, yesh!  Every bit as good as expected!  It is my favorite made soap and favorite flavor soap of all time!",5
15071,I threw them out.  I find them hard to place and they looked fake.,1
15072,Must be a bad batch. Reek of machine oil. Markings look unfinished.,2
15073,good stuff- not too greasy (for grease) and no smell but beeswax,5
15074,This hair color covers really good. I have used it for years now. I am real happy with it.,5
15075,chain too short to go over head...need to undo clasp to wear it,3
15076,"A great pillow, but the color is not a match.  It is nice to never recline on a cold plastic surface.",4
15077,Didn't even get what I orderd it's not what the picture is. There ugly don't buy they were just plain boring colors,1
15078,"A little smaller than I expected -  but sharp. They come from Asia, so a longer than usual wait - but sooooo inexpensive.",4
15079,I am not noticing any change to my gums using this product! I was hoping to see some results by now!,3
15080,These creams... they just don't work. Even temporarily. It's all about toning and losing a LOT of your fat to reduce.,1
15081,"Product fits both my lash curlers (different brands), wearing and working well. Great deal for the $$$!!",5
15082,These headbands are well made and have plenty of room to make them as wide or as thin as you need them. Great value.,4
15083,So far it works well I drink tea often and I don't have tea breath anymore,4
15084,Does not glow as nicely as show in picture and glow does not last long even when charged in direct light.,1
15085,"It looks nice, does the job.  Weighty base makes it stable.  The knurling on the main rod matches the Merkur razor nicely.",4
15086,"I have very fine hair and this doesn't release my hair well, it get tangled in it.",2
15087,This appliance works well to floss your teeth and is easy to use.  I recommend it to anyone who is looking for an easier way to floss.,4
15088,"Shipping took forever, but the product itself is pretty good.",3
15089,"Dry, not impressed. Didn't look or feel good as I was expecting. I love Revlon's Aqua Colorstay loose mineral power-AMAZING",1
15090,I have been using this product for 25 years.  Fantastic moisturizer.,5
15091,Good quality at a good price. Much less expensive than at the national beauty supply chain. A pleasant upgrade to the aging clippers.,5
15092,"Good brush, took a little getting used to on my skin at first, but now it feels much better to brush.",4
15093,Leaves my skin soft and smells wonderful. Have not used very long but so far so good,5
15094,My husband loves this product. Easy to use and it works well. It arrived quickly.,5
15095,"Bad bottle,scent isn't good,feel nothing like before",1
15096,It makes my hair sticky. It is more like a taft. The coverage is good if you spray a lot.,2
15097,Stop working after using only ONCE.. returning it. Would give zero star if i could.,1
15098,"Big tub at good price, using for post CO2 laser",5
15099,"The cones do not have a significant scent to them, but more of a calming one.  The product was shipped and delivered on time.",4
15100,"Encellent product. Great pricing, much cheaper than in the salon. Very fast shipping",5
15101,Not as large as it looks in picture...other than size it is exactly as pictured.,3
15102,"not like the ones from years ago.. bristles are far apart. and not as hot.... but price is ok, and couldn't find anywhere else",3
15103,Only used it 2 times so far....but I need more practice with it that's for sure.,4
15104,"Good solid razor. I can't wait for 2 days between shaving, like I did with my last one, but it does a good job.",4
15105,Very pricey!! Buy at Wal-Mart! Better price!,3
15106,Love it! My chronic cracked heels are now easy to keep smooth and soft. Makes mani/pedi so much better and easier.,4
15107,Got them fast but one of the brushes unglued the second day I got them ,3
15108,Took 6 mo as recommended. No change except money wasted.,2
15109,It works but DONT use while wearing normal clothes cuz it sprays out drips sometimes.,4
15110,"Long lasting color! It does feel a little dry, I cover it with lip balm and that works fine :)",4
15111,"Very bad will never use it , it takes 15 days for shipping ,the worst experience ever.",1
15112,These cones don't smell like the superhit sticks. They have a more rose type smell. I will only buy the sticks from now on.,3
15113,"I`m very pleased with this product, it works great. I will definitely recommend this to anyone.",4
15114,I was hoping this razor would be great since I Love my T780 but this groomer was awful and left my disappointed.,1
15115,It doesn't seem the same as the one I had purchased in a chain store.,2
15116,Wish this came in a squeeze tube. A lot is lost when a product that is less than viscus comes in a bottle.,4
15117,"I love these brushed they work great and I got them for super cheap I love it, definitely will buy more.",5
15118,Do not waste your money on this device. Does not provide the results as advertised. This is just another gimmick to take your money.,1
15119,This is not authentic. I compared it to the authentic one and the texture and formula was different. It does cider but not as great.,2
15120,"Not as powerful as I had hoped, but great for a backup/guest bathroom.",3
15121,Not bad it's a good color thank you for all the samples sellers,4
15122,"Like all Maybelline New York lipsticks, this one is great.",4
15123,They are good and sharp cut myself every so often.,3
15124,good product helps with smooth shaving without a strong odor.,4
15125,Barely blows hot air. Not hot enough .Curl release doesn't work . Sorry not worth the price,1
15126,Using these products for a few years now and love this line. Especially like shampoos and lotions. Happy customer and will keep buying H2o products.,5
15127,So glad it doesn't claim to be a hairagami.  Works just fine,4
15128,Its okay....you will have to end up retouching your makeup later during the day,4
15129,These were too short and the back cut into the inside of my lip within five minutes of putting one in. Pretty mad about it.,1
15130,Does as described but more scratchy then over brands which I prefer.,3
15131,Is nice but the way they glue the ring is sideways..I steel like it but ..is crapy,2
15132,"its ok and does a decent job, disappointed because you can't use it in the shower",4
15133,"OK, but needs some glue on the handles. The brushes are very soft though, I like them.",3
15134,"As you can expect with e.l.f. products, it doesn't stay on for long, but it looks really good especially if you use primer beforehand.",4
15135,I really like the way this product  enhances my hair's natural curl without being sticky.  Lightweight and non-greasy.,5
15136,This stuff works really well. I have not had trouble with any shedding.  Mine did not have a brush for some reason.,4
15137,This wasn't a very good menstrual cup for me I may try a different brand,1
15138,This turned my moms hair dark brown. Which is weird.,1
15139,Combs fell out after only 2 uses. Burnt the heck out of my neck and ear... No heat settings other than low and high.,1
15140,My only complaint is ths product did not come in 4 different colors...only three. Hard to keep up with whos is whos toothbrush.,5
15141,It does a decent job flushing in between your teeth. It has a difficult time shutting off the water with the button on the wand.,3
15142,"This product has taken my naturally curly hair to another level.  More ""good hair days"" for me! Thanks a bunch.",5
15143,"It works; and, I love the name ""Mad Hippie""",5
15144,A nice jar for putting together  my shaving grooming supplies.,4
15145,this is the 2nd replacement I purchased and it works great,4
15146,Love this product! Works great on sensitive skin. I can even wear it under my makeup.,4
15147,I have used this a lot  It's a good product.,4
15148,They smell great but my hair was left very dry after using these. I had to stop using them.,2
15149,I absolutely love this product and buy for myself and all of my friends.  Can't say enough about these.,5
15150,"It's a great kit, my only complaint would be that they should include wax remover.",4
15151,Mine came in green. Let me choose a color like a real product.,3
15152,Excellent product.  We had a water pik that was several years old.  The technology has sure increased.  Love the new one.,5
15153,this is perfect for beginners to stretch the Uterine as to help with passing kidney stones .But I stress be careful as to not damage it,5
15154,I like it. I would purchase again for the price posted.,4
15155,Great product to use in between pedicures or just to refresh your feet.,4
15156,"Great product, would be a 5 if the shadows were higher pigment.",4
15157,"I like how natural it is, but smell is yucky. Love that it's safe for my kids",3
15158,Not authentic. I purchased an authentic beauty blender after purchasing this and noticed a lot of differences including texture and packaging.,1
15159,"Handy, but expensive for it's volume...nice packaging!",3
15160,My grand daughter is a Vidal Sassoon graduate and introduced me to this. It makes my hair more manageable and I can use it on dry hair.,5
15161,"I love Ponds products, however this came without a box and the container it self had no seal, so I will not use it.",3
15162,Sounds are good quality. However this item does not come with the case as stated,3
15163,Smells gross. It didn't really work for my oily/thin hair. Lush products worked better.,1
15164,It's sturdy to hold my razor and very fancy.,5
15165,Chain is too short. Barely fits around a child's neck,3
15166,Not the same formula I was using.  this is noticeably less moisturizing.  not sure what happened.,2
15167,Delivery was promptly.  Products in good order.  Would shop again.,4
15168,"Works very well, a little bit expensive compared to more common products.",4
15169,Not as big as I expected. My hair doesn't fit,1
15170,"The product is okay, it does start to wrinkle your lips and make them look crusty and dry though",2
15171,It keeps my razor and shaving brush off of the counter.  The stand weighs enough that it isn't easily toppled over or pushed around.,4
15172,The warmer stopped working after one use. It was too late for me to return it.,1
15173,"i like the clean feeling but not sure if the device is effective,i used it for about a month and did not see my dentist yet",5
15174,The quality of these brushes is not that great but I guess they are OK for the price,2
15175,"This gave me killer stomach cramps. I'm sure they are great for some, just not what my body needs I suppose.",1
15176,The button on my handle is permanently stuck.  So it is broken.  Bummer.  Lasted only 9 months.,2
15177,love it .... been using for over a week and feels great on the skin,5
15178,It is what I expected.  i have used it before..,4
15179,"This is a good buy, good quality and long Battery life. very easy to use.",4
15180,"great to hold eye gel, mirror makes it easy to put get in eyes",5
15181,Good reasonably priced product.  A little goes a long way.,4
15182,I've used this shaver for some time now and the battery life is quite good.  No complaints with the shave quality.,5
15183,very good.  only negative is aiming it at roots a little difficult to pinpoint location,4
15184,"I don't know if I got a bad batch, but it smells terrible! Might have gone rancid.",2
15185,Probably too soon to tell but I don't see a difference after several applications.,3
15186,"Pretty standard exfoliating gloves.  The ones I received were cream colored, not green as pictured.",3
15187,Really gets gums and teeth clean but have had problems with pause valve.,3
15188,The only blush I use because I am concerned about using less chemicals on my body,5
15189,Blades do not shave well. It sometimes hurt my skin.,3
15190,"It is a nice color, I like to add it on with some lip balm.",4
15191,"This is for resale but the stone is so small, that the selling factor is going to have to be something else.",3
15192,I love this flash tape.  It stays put and does it's job perfectly.  Highly recommend it.,5
15193,it doesn't work the way it should!  they should make it bigger and give more variety in colors.  I would not buy it again!,1
15194,Non sticky.  Doesn't have a shiny look after application.,4
15195,the plastic is comfortable. I just wish it was a little  bit longer.,3
15196,"Get product, just like the professionals. You will need to get other strips from like Sally's.",2
15197,it was a bit expensive but i didn't want to buy a whole new electirc razer,4
15198,It's actually little big is size and the color was faded not up to the level expected,3
15199,"One of these came broken, so I would give it no stars if at all possible!",1
15200,Too expensive.  I just found 78 oz of this stuff at Costco for $23.99.,3
15201,"Love how it lights up the room. Very flimsy cover, would be easy for my 2 year old to destroy.",4
15202,Helps manscaping be less annoying than with a regular razor. I actually am in control and far less fearful than before.,4
15203,Started using but stopped because noticed my hair was falling.,3
15204,Love this stuff makes my skin feel great the only brand I buy just wish it did not cost so much,5
15205,"All good, except I don't think I get as close a shave as with my previous shaver.",4
15206,"I've had this for a couple of months now and ""0"" problems.  All attachments work well and the self sharpening feature reall does work!",4
15207,I used this product a few years ago and just purchased it again.  It does work well worth the cost.,5
15208,"Great stand, let's the brush drain and dry when not using...",4
15209,The replacement heads fit the razor perfectly. I thought I would need a new razor as the replacement blades are not sold locally anymore.,4
15210,More Vanilla than Sandalwood. Scent does not stay with you long.,3
15211,"These came to me clean, no weird smells, none broken, nice quality, an the pen works well. I will order from them again.",5
15212,It works great!  I especially like it because it releases my hair easily - no getting tangled!,4
15213,"the texture of it isn't so great. it's very dry which makes it hard to apply, however the pigment is amazing.",2
15214,So far I really like. I have a lot of hypo pigmentation and I have tried everything including obagi.,4
15215,Bought this for my elderly mother who has trouble trimming her toenails.  She doesn't use it because it is difficult to use and very uncomfortable.,2
15216,It's super cheap as soon as i opened the package it broke I'm very unsatisfied.,1
15217,A birthday gift that was greatly appreciated.  Made well and should last.,5
15218,Its small and does the job. Pretty easy to use. Just figuring out where to place it for preference is fun,4
15219,pruduct tasts like sugar.  container hard to turn.  very dry.,1
15220,I use these for dry manual exfoliation before showering and they work great and are not too abrasive when used in a gentle circular motion.,5
15221,The quality is not what you would expect from a hair donut from Chares  But for $2!  It was worth it. :),4
15222,The studs. We're very small and delivery time was to long,2
15223,"Shave is smoother, but not a huge fan of the aroma.",3
15224,Product is okay.  Does as expected. A little expensive.,4
15225,"they came in pink. they're okay, definitely had better.",3
15226,My husband has been using these razors and replacement heads for years.  He really likes them.,5
15227,"No longer works and it's too late to return it. Very unhappy, I got the same one from target and it lasted much longer.",1
15228,"These are awesome for a subtle look. They do break over time unfortunately with extended use. Otherwise, great product!!",3
15229,The vertical pole was not solidly attached to the base and would not screw in.  Unusable.  A piece of crap made in China.,1
15230,It a nice system but the extras are just samples. need to buy extra pre wax and cooling gel and concealer :(,4
15231,"PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!  CAN'T SPREAD ACROSS LIPS AND WHEN YOU DO, THEY TINGLE.  DO NOT USE.",1
15232,This razor does all that is promised.  It does shave as close a a regular razor but with very little irratation.,5
15233,"I want to like these because the price is so good, but they cut my face up pretty bad every time I used them.",2
15234,This lace glue doesn't work don't waste your money please,1
15235,Seems to be working. Been using it for 3 months. Not shedding near as much. Hair is growing a little faster too,4
15236,All this was a freshening mask. It didn't do as advertised. Purchase this if you want to feel the cool tingling while using.,3
15237,The scent is citrusy. Not my favorite but it does its job.,4
15238,"Purchased at my doctors advise while doing radiation. Works really good, just a little too greasy.",4
15239,good but breaks easily. Stays on hair much better than others,4
15240,The color which was sent wasn't the color which was advertised. I am dissatisfied with this product and I would not purchase again.,1
15241,there are alot of them...super small! they are fun to use with my family for nails or even other art projects,4
15242,"blocked out most of light, but the lens fell out of one of them.  Had to put back in",4
15243,apparatus is alright bot Ongo sent a Euro model that needs an adapter for domestic use !,2
15244,Head protector too sharp. Easily broken. There are better choices.,3
15245,Love my purse. Received product fast and as advertised.,4
15246,"Came in almost 2 months after ordered, there are only 8-10 nose rings not 20, waste of money.",1
15247,What you receive is one (1) individual 1 ounce stick for your $5.99.  Quite the rip off.,1
15248,"My customers loved the tiaras,  even came back  to let me know. They were a hit at the Mardi Gras ball. C.L.",5
15249,"Great product, but I added additional oils to strengthen it.",4
15250,Not the color I expected and less matte then expected but good,4
15251,The wax sucks...but the warmer is nice and fast. No point of adding those extra stuff. Is kind off pointless :),1
15252,I have been using Gillette Atra plus for a good number of years with great results. The shaves are alway close.,4
15253,Product was as described.  Works great. Shipment came earlier than estimated,4
15254,"I used it one time and it smelled so bad, that I returned it.",1
15255,Still testing it out but it has cleared my dry skin patches after about a month. I am satisfied with this product thus far.,4
15256,So far so good. Deodorant came a Little shriveled but seems to work fine,4
15257,This cape is a fun color to entice even the pickiest of kids.  Large enough that my husband even sports it!  Nice quality and good price.,4
15258,A little hard to put on the shirts without being seen.,3
15259,Great product!  Needs added coilloidial silver for additional protection.,5
15260,Worked really well. Need more black pens in the set though,4
15261,Easy to operate and does not take up a lot of counter space as did the old one.  I would recommend it.,5
15262,perfect wig for bulma cosplay and it can be styled into literally any of her hairstyles (except maybe the afro),5
15263,The neck is a little large to use for kids! Works fantastic for adults.,4
15264,Didn't realize how small the bottles were. Or that it couldn't be returned free. Not worth it at all.,1
15265,Does what it is suppoed to do.  Leaves my teeth and gums feeling very clean.,4
15266,"It you like a light razor, this is great. It doesn't feel like it is going to fall apart, and travels well.",5
15267,"I purchased this for my tween and I like the citrus smell, but could not tell you anything about the product.",3
15268,Does not lather well and have not noticed a difference in my hair,3
15269,Wow. very powerful. I really like using it and makes me want to floss more often,4
15270,"This waterpik makes a huge noise.

 I don't recommend this product.",1
15271,"Worked well for a few months, but then just stopped working.",3
15272,"Just ok, not as moisturizing as I had hoped for",3
15273,"Good for one use at a time, lucky if you can use them once again. Seem to
Lose their sharp edge rather quickly.",2
15274,its OK did the job...but package fooled me...pac big ...but very tiny amount of product inside...a little deceiving.,3
15275,"Well made stand, the base is a little wobbly, other than that it does what I need it to.",4
15276,"The product is nice, but I have to return this because it was packaged too roughly, and the container arrived broken.",3
15277,Hair is a beautiful color! I bought for my Halloween costume-Mermaid. It's perfect!,5
15278,I was misled. I wanted a tiny light travel hair dryer. This is too big and heavy,3
15279,Love Andalou products. I wanted a way to try out some other types of products and his is a great way.,5
15280,Don't like these they're not as pretty up close.,1
15281,The best shaving cream. No rash. No itching. Smells amazing! Tried many other brands - nope. This is the best,5
15282,Didn't like the fact that made my eyes itchy and it didn't make my eyelashes extended.. Might be going back,1
15283,Bought for my son for Christmas. He says it works great and really likes the vacuum feature.,4
15284,I like it. I will order again once exhausted.,5
15285,Great brushes but they fall apart after a few months. But they are inexpensive and work break for a little while.,3
15286,Not good for my fine texlaxed AA hair...made my hair dry and brittle. But different products work best for different hair types.,2
15287,"Decent shaver. I have dropped it a few times, and the shave head came apart, but i have been able to fix it everytime.",3
15288,"We always buy the cheapest Braun and we use it for shaving, cutting hair, dog grooming.  Superb product for a low price.",5
15289,I love to spray this on my sheets and other linens when I iron them.  It helps to get the wrinkles out and they spell wonderful.,4
15290,They are so small what is thisI want my money back,1
15291,It Keeps it charge for quite a long time and will transform your neckbeard into a stylish and attractive look. Lol,4
15292,They have gone crazy with the price on this product. Best buy is at Walmart for around $5 and occasionally it goes on sale.,3
15293,Spend the money and get a nicer trimmer. Settings on this one sucks.,1
15294,Nice wish it was bigger however like it very much.,4
15295,I wasn't sure what Extra Coarse meant but now I know that I need to order the next level up next time.  Descriptions are vague.,3
15296,"The brush tops fell off shortly after purchasing, but they were easy to glue back on.",3
15297,Easy to use and install. Keeps the razor clean and lubricated.,4
15298,Makes my face look as if it was crafted from baby bottoms. However I prefer my souffl edible.,4
15299,"Very nice, perfect for a pre-shave for electric machine.",5
15300,"theres nothing out there that works for me,very dissapointed considering the positive reviews.",1
15301,"I purchased this comb as a gift, it is much smaller in the real life",3
15302,product was Ok but took a long time to get here - 10days!!,4
15303,It doesn't stop the wetness but it stops the chaffing. I don't think anything would stop my body from sweating so much.,5
15304,"Love the design but hard to fasten, can't do by yourself",2
15305,"I have been using the Loreal cream for a couple of weeks, & I haven't seen any results yet. :(",1
15306,"I enjoy saving money so this is an excellent product for the price, and the cats don't mind being trimmed with it as well.",4
15307,"I love Aquaphor for chapped lips, but it says there are six pots in a package and there was only one.",1
15308,"Very clean gums with this product for a healthy mouth, I like it.",5
15309,Live the quality in these brushes and for yhr price it's an unbeatable deal!,4
15310,Love this moisturizer and all Mary Kay Timewise products. This is not greasy or heavy and has a light fragrance.  Leaves your skin soft.,5
15311,So good for my skin that tends to be dry.,5
15312,Just like any other blade I've tried. They don't last any longer than the ones I buy at the discount store.,3
15313,Must have!!! Smells just like tom fords tuscan leather! Amazing love it!!,5
15314,Very unhappy can't seem to get a close shave. I regret paying almost $200.00,1
15315,They are very pretty and they can bend slightly so that you can fit it to you're ear.,5
15316,Fun colours to play with and good pigmentation. The texture is a little grainy though,4
15317,"Ok color but I liked the ""nudes"" so much better.",3
15318,Tiny stones. Super cheap material.  Don't waste your time.  This is horrible.,1
15319,Everything was very cute and of nice quality. The instructions sent and suggestions was very helpful. Very excited to use at my sisters baby shower.,5
15320,"At least for my complexion ....
But if I use a ""light "" hand applying it ....
It works....not too impressed",3
15321,Can't believe his big the jar is...twice the size of the ones I buy in the store! Great bargain.,5
15322,"simple and effective to use to heal small irritations and nicks that may not be that visible, has improved my skin tone !.",5
15323,bad quality bad quality bad quality bad quality bad quality bad quality bad quality bad quality bad quality bad quality bad quality bad quality,1
15324,"I've been using it for many years and I don't know what I would do without it.
It arrived on time.",5
15325,It didn't work. Right it got caught on my headbands and clothes. It kept falling off and and it look ugly and werid,2
15326,I do not feel it can remove oil from my face . I do not like it,1
15327,"Have not used it.  Package so small,  miniscule print  for application instructions.  Do not want to ruin my skin by improper application.",1
15328,"Does the job just fine and travels well. It won't get super-close but it is a trimmer, not a shaver.",4
15329,poor quality..had to throw it away 2 weeks after getting it,1
15330,I love super hit cones but these are not or this sellers batch is spoiled or something,1
15331,This is too greasy and turns white. Palmers Olive Oil Super Edge Control outranks this hands down!!,2
15332,"Not power enough for my beard, I need a daily shave, not for me. Could be for an emergency.",3
15333,You need to use it over regular mascara but the glitter doesn't show very well.,1
15334,"Love this product for combo skin, especially during the spring and summer. Keeps the oil at bay while helping clear my skin!",5
15335,"They tore after the second use at the tip, they weren't expensive so I will re-order more than one pair next time!",4
15336,Too dark for me. Which is my fault but it doesn't look like the color in the pic.,3
15337,"Absolutely TERRIBLE!!!!!! The lather,the feel, after the rinse. It's all just terrible!",1
15338,Love the comb! Although I thought it might have been a little bigger from the picture,5
15339,"it's the worst shaver I've ever had.

15340,This trimmer was used about 4 times before it broke--don't waste your money.,1
15341,not sure if it made my pores smaller but it did make my skin feel better than before i used it,3
15342,All was fine with products I purchased. I just don't understand why I was charged for shipping fees.,5
15343,This product met my expectations.  It really is tangle free and works well even on medium length hair.  Shipment was prompt and well packed.,4

15345,A favorite fragrance & also good for scenting lingerie drawers.,5
15346,Item is very small and not what it seems. This is more like a small bean bag not a pillow.,2
15347,Awesome bag nice package and nice and neatly wrap and boxed I recommend to everyone who's looking for leather bag,5
15348,"They are really really small, they are kinda not a brushed/polished gold or silver.  Kinda dull in color.  But fit great.",4

15364,"Good product for a lady, I didn't realize it would smell so feminine based on description.",3
15365,The pills is a nice aid but for us it tends to slide out. If I could get it up stay put...wow!,4
15366,"Cute and comfy. They look exactly like the photo. They're just slightly too large for my hands, though!",4
15367,When I received the product it was spilled all over the package all the colors were mixed. I guess you get what you pay for.,2

15370,Very cute set. I gave it as a gift and the recipient loves them!,4
15371,Works very well. I'm amazed how long it runs on a set of batteries.,4
15372,Smelled great when it arrived in packaging. Used in shower once and smelled great. Second shower use I notice no patchouli scent at all.,1

15385,Looks great with brush and my safety razor. would order again.,5
15386,They were alittle shorter than the original ones that came with the hydro floss,3
15387,"Good price/product.  However, it is misleading when display (pack of 2) when it is only for 1!",4
15388,Really does the job. One of the best. Quality of the product is excellent.,4
15389,Looks nice - but they are heavy - after a few hours I have to take them off - too heavy for my ears,4
15390,Good. Better than other black sponges because sometimes they show through hair but this one is made up of hair so you can wear it without worries.,3
15391,"Normal, typical and pretty good. The main thing is that it gets used!",3
15392,This broke the day I received it. I only wore it a few hours. It is cheap and cheaply made.,1

15398,been using this for over 10 years. its amazing.  highly recommend this to all.,5

15403,LIKE THE SMELL BUT USE A LITTLE. IT GOES A LONG WAY!,4
15404,Do not like it due to the face that the head of the cutter comes off and will not stay tight>,2
15405,A beautiful stand and a must have.  However it does not fit the Gillette Proshield line of shavers properly.  The product finishing is first class.,4
15406,"Case doesn't stay together after the daunting task of cracking this thing open for the first time. Otherwise, they serve their purpose.",3
15407,"Wouldn't even give it a 1, don't work and are too noticeable.  These are a waste of money, DO NOT BUY!",1
15408,"While the components are more in number, actual usage is little less and hence felt that the pricing is more.",4

15421,"I have never had a yeast infection in myour life, I'm 21, as soon as i began using this is got a yeast infection.",1
15422,product was thick and gummy when it arrived. I will try to thin it with polish remover.,2

15429,"It makes my teeth much cleaner than before. It's realy usefulI.
I have already introduced it to my friends. ^ ^",5
15430,"It's a great razor overall, I give it 4 stars just because the cartridge is more expensive than others.",4
15431,Wonder when someone will come up with a solution to tangled cords... this product is good the button is a bit stiff to release brush...,4
15432,You don't get 5 different colors and they break very easy not worth your money!!!!,1
15433,"Takes too long to get to a hot temperature but once it warms up, it works well.",4
15434,I had a previous water pic and when it was turned up high it seemed as though the force of the water was stronger in the previous one!,4
15435,This was a gift for my daughter. But she loves this brand.,4
15436,"Seems like an okay product, just wanted one that rotated.",2
15437,i was amazed . it did not take the spots away completely but they are barely visible.,5
15438,These are okay brushes but you get what you pay for. They barely pick up any product so I don't even use any of them.,3
15439,"Nice color but lighter than it looks. Great scent, lasts a decent amount of time.",4
15440,Works but is extremely loud. We can't use it if anyone in the house is sleeping.,4

15442,"The product is hard to put on, you have to press down pretty hard for it to come out of the bottle. Very disappointed.",2
15443,All bars smell the same and of vomit. So if you like the aroma of bile this is the soap for you.,1
15444,The Mitchum Smart Solid is not so smart it keeps breaking which ends up in the GARBAGE! Works great but not worth the hassle.,3
15445,Doesn't really work for women with D breast and bigger.,1
15446,"I really liked the product, I use it after I've tanned & showered to keep the scalley skin away...will but again",4
15447,"This is a great compact water pik.  Has many heads , functions well. serves its purpose.  Happy with this purchase.",4
15448,"My daughter loves her wig! It was purchased for Halloween, but she's still wearing it!",5
15449,"I was expecting a clear color and it did not come that way, smells the same though",3
15450,"Nice color choices but the bands tend to break after 3 or 4 wearings.
Cheap construction.",1
15451,"Large barrel is nice but, doesn't get very hot, and cord gets tangled easily, so is a bit difficulty to use.",3
15452,"It dries my hair, doesnt help to reduce dandruff. I have to use very less shampoo nevertheless it dries.. don't know how this got higher ratings",1

15454,"Great product. Help alleviate my gum pain. Does the job, worth every dollars. Thank you",4

15465,"It wasn't a miracle, but my feet did peel..",4
15466,Worked one night only.  The instructions are horrible to read since they are very poorly translated into English. Looked nice and smelled great that one time!,1
15467,"perfect for a care package, gift basket or stocking stuffer.",4
15468,"Waterpikest in the businesst. Does what its designed to do and does it well.
Good price and fast efficent service.",4
15469,Second time ordering these. Once you try them you will not go back to regular bras.,5

15477,nice quality and I like that there is a variety of sizes in the mix,4
15478,A hair trimmer does the job better than this product. I strongly do not recommend it to anyone who consider buying it.,3
15479,Love the smell and works great and gets my skin squeaky clean.,5
15480,This was a gift because it's hard to find around here. My wife loves this product. She says it helps with her coloring and adds body,5
15481,I think I need to take this product for a longer period of time to see if I get results as advertised and it's a little expensive.,3
15482,Have been using this for over 25 years. It is the ONLY cream I ever use on my face!!  It is absolutely the best!!,5
15483,Cleaned my hair and was easy to travel with. Not a fan of this particular scent,3

15499,Slow shipping and it hurts too much when I wear it. And its easy to lose,1
15500,I didn't like the smell at all and bubbles dissolve very soon. Disappointed !,1
15501,Been seeing improvements after 3 weeks of using it twice a day. So far so good.,3
15502,Doesn't do anything to improve shaving experience.  I just shave in the shower without this. This was a waste of money,1
15503,It wasn't the shade of red that I thought it would be.,3
15504,Nice stand but it does not hold the modern razor handles so basically it just holds the brush.,2
15505,I loce theproduct but i got the purple set instead. Didnt realize it till i checked my order history!,2
15506,"Inexpensive, but works well. Runs about a week on one charge. Light and easy to use. Recommended.",4

15508,Leaves sticky weird feel on hands and shaver but works!!!!!!!!!!!!,4

15515,Great product. Love that it is food grade and great for bath soaks.,4
15516,"Received as advertised, however flow concentrator attachment did not stay attached.  Needed attachment to be usable so I returned it.",3
15517,Nice and long to reach all the way down my giant back!,4
15518,"sticky on the skin,serves its purpose for dry skin",4
15519,I have always hated flossing.  This water pik is almost fun to use.  Once your gums toughen up you will never floss again.,5
15520,Used it to glue moleskin braces for a puppies ears.  It stuck pretty well but stinky.,4
15521,"Decent groomer.  One of the plastic tooth in the attachment broke, but other than that, it does a decent job.",3
15522,"Eh - didn't work for the lotion I wanted to put in it, but I could see how it would work for thinner lotion.",3
15523,This was a great buy for just a few dollars and free shipping but magnet doesn't keep it closed very well.,3

15529,Just got it today looks great and can't wait to use it and it also came very fast!! :),5

15531,"Wonderful stuff!  Cools, softens.... I love it!",5
15532,Love this stand. Sturdy and weighted properly.  Good value. Looks great on my vanity.,5
15533,"tried shampoo & conditioner as well and did not care for any of them.  Left my hair dry, (felt like wheat straw), unmanageable.",1
15534,Pillow looks like the right thing...  My husband decided it wasn't the right size we were looking for.  Prompt with the return process.,4

15545,I am allergic to this product.  Broke out in a very painful rash.,1
15546,Cute and not a bad price. The ribbon around the band started to unwrap but that can be fixed with glue easily.,3
15547,Doesn't warm oil/lotion very throughly or keep it warm for very long. Not worth it.,2
15548,"Shaver is EXTREMELY loud and with HIGH pitched noise,  and INFERIOR manufacturing quality. Not the Remington I knew! 0 star, not even 1 star.",1
15549,my favorite for my wife.has clean smell that she gets compliments on,4
15550,Classic color. Looks good on everybody... Good for every season,5
15551,"Like the idea of using old formula shampoo, in bar form.  Simple ingredients that for the most part I can understand",4

15554,Too heavy. I've never even worn it a full day.,2
15555,It is so thick you cant get it out of the bottle.,2
15556,I got all 20 pieces but none of them were the ones in the picture. Kind of mad but I still got the piercings,4

15574,These work great if you are using shellac polish. They tend to fall off of regular.,3
15575,The product only fills about 1/4 of the container. It's not worth the price when the product doesn't touch the top of the logo.,2
15576,Great!  I like it a lot.  It keeps certain pieces of clothing in place.b I would definitely recommend it.,4
15577,"Its dependable replace for some of my retired irons. I probably should have bought the pair a great deal. Fair,",3

15579,"Great kit to get started, but my lid came cracked!",3
15580,This works well to remove hair but the smell is awful.  Only used once so far because of the smell.,3
15581,This Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser is easy to use and does everything one would expect from this product. It is compact and quiet.,4
15582,Works well but leaves too much white residue on your face.,2

15612,seems to work well but the smell is not terribly pleasant. I am not sure if I would purchase again,4
15613,A bit stronger scent than anticipated. Still a good hippie smell.,4
15614,Love the product... Exactly what I need it just doesn't last as long as other hot curling brushes...,4
15615,Like it but not alot of difference from Vaseline at all.,3
15616,"the brushes are?cute, my daughter liked the design, but they get clumped. it was shipped within the time frame.",3

15618,I was happy to get these but they are small trial size one n very small u can get maybe 2 uses outta the bottles.,3
15619,Be aware that size is wrong. It is only a small one 0.3 oz instead 0.6 oz. The product itself is fine just the wrong size.,2
15620,I hadn't used this is years.  It's OK. Does what it's supposed to.  I think.,3

15641,I really loved this cream. It is light but very effective. I am ordering for a second time. I would reommend this item.,5

15649,"I am not an easy shave.  This shaver is ok+, and I would probably buy another.  Service & shipping was very good.",4
15650,"Leaves my hair a little frizzy, but overall it's what I expected.  Smells nice.",4
15651,They were great until about a week I used brush cleanser on them after every use and they molded .,3
15652,what can go wrong... they work in the sun and tanning booth.,4
15653,I had to dump these after a few days.  The odor emitted from the bag smells like a bunch of mixed chemicals.,2
15654,If you don't mind the scent. It do the job right,4

15661,Don't see any results after two months and I think a treatment would be better than trying this things =(,2
15662,in the parcel i see another item than on the pictures! Bad service,1
15663,"These are functional and exactly as described. However, they are listed as ""prime"" yet I had to wait over a week to receive them.",3
15664,If I could give it a 0 I would they are so small I can't even use them.,1

15676,"Usually is satified with this product. Last order however, the lid cane broken into some pieces.",4
15677,Did not work well. I somehow even managed to make myself bleed on more than one occasion. Not worth the frustration.,1
15678,These brushes are really tuff and it makes it hard to put your makeup on.,2
15679,"Timely delivery and delivered item as seen, as promised.",5
15680,great scent and gift for teen; hard to find scent after fall,5
15681,Like every thing about it except the hose is a bit too short unless the device is moved right to the edge of the sink.,4
15682,Does not take the place of traditional flossing but is good in a pinch. Very messy. Careful of the button going off in another direction.,3
15683,It's was very pretty but too big for what I was looking for....,3
15684,You'll be surprised at not only the difference of how your teeth look but also how much gets removed even after you brush.,5
15685,"The color turned only after hours of wearing. Junk, won't buy again",2
15686,"What's the rationale not showing the ingredients and the complete image of the product? I may have liked the product, now I hate it.",1
15687,I will be purchasing a second one to leave at the office.,4

15690,Color didn't match me well.  Never wear it.,1
15691,"Surprised how well it works , removing particles of food between my teeth!  I would recommend this product to anyone as a supplement to brushing",4
15692,Best Floss ever. My teeth get cleaned where no toothbrush can go. I feel a difference to other types of floss. This feels cleaner.,5
15693,Husband's favorite and getting hard to find in local stores. The perfect solution - pun intended!,5
15694,"the product seems good, but the problem is it feels oily and make my face look shiny if wearing alone.",3
15695,"Very versatile, easy to use, and does the job.",5
15696,"i like it because it works fast. i don't like it because once you stop using it, your skin will break out and become very dark",4
15697,It worked okay for the price but Glytone and Obagi work a lot better for me (I have fair skin with sun damage).,3
15698,"Leaves my hair a little frizzy, but overall it's what I expected.  Smells nice.",4
15699,"Terrible product, it left me with sores under my arms",1
15700,"It's a little too snug for my head, so I wear it occasionally.",3
15701,I am having issues going against the grain. But I think that is my lathe. Nice blades.,5
15702,Nice and lightweight.  Easy to fill.  Love the light and auto turn off.,5
15703,the pressure is noticeably weaker than the conventional water pic machine.the pressure is noticeably weaker than the conventional water pic machine.,3
15704,Could have been better if it had remained with its lever to move the blade up and down like its predecesor the Hc 364,4
15705,Weak motor.  I had to return it.  I was not satisfied with it.,1
15706,"Poorly made, cheap quality, and not sharp enough to cut cuticles cleanly without snagging. Pick another brand for your hand.",1

15708,Turned out exactly how I needed it to look! Really good quality!,5
15709,"Great product, easy to use.  My skin appears firmer.",5
15710,Sharp enough for daily shave without causing irritation. I easily get a week from each blade.,4
15711,This product is simply amazing. You can mix it with distilled water and make your own baby wipes simple dimple. Smells great works great.,5
15712,unfortunalty this unit was going to travel with us to replace our waterpik.. to even close. good thought poor execution.,1
15713,Nice cover spray.  Not sticky like some sprays.  Comes out in wash.,4
15714,This was recommended by my dermatologist.  Also for lipgloss.,4
15715,works ok same as the stuff at the drug store.,4
15716,After one use this became too stretchy. The fabric is too thin to be absorbent.,2
15717,On time the price is right the product is as described it is exactly as it should be trust me the weight is right,5
15718,"just as pictured, it will dress up an otherwise plain sweater",4
15719,I purchased this product since I already had one for my sons birthday gift.  Works good for trimming the stache and beard.,4

15721,I recieve the item i was really upset the item was damage,1
15722,"have used these several times to get rid of my yellowing from smoking,they work great and are easy to use",4
15723,Forget it!  Takes weeks to get & is not useful!,1
15724,Overpriced!!! I paid $13 for 2 Dixie cup sized containers.,1
15725,I use it for my own cosmetics and moisturizers. It's wonderful.,5
15726,I Love these for the shower. Make me feel nice and clean. Truly a favorite.,5
15727,Goes on smooth and very light. I use it at night and have seen a difference using this plus the vitamin c serum together. Great product,5
15728,One liter almost lasted a year.... I forgot how much I spent but it's worth it,5
15729,Didn't look anything like the picture. Not as dense and full.,1
15730,They had a few bumps and one stone missing but for the price and to give to young girls worth it.,4
15731,These blades cut well and last me about 3 or 4 shaves. I have a coarse beard.,4
15732,Gets rid of the dead skin better than just a towel,4
15733,Do not wast your money this comb fell apart in two weeks of arriving 8 weeks after I ordered it.,1
15734,This is my emergency treatment for when my teeth hurt from scrubbing too hard in an area I have receding gums.  Works quite well.,4
15735,"This is a beautiful bag, but flimsy fabric and no lining. For the price I expected a better product.",3
15736,This is no different than vaseline so if u have psoriasis its a waste of money!,1
15737,"Everything is great but the wax that comes with this
It doesn't spread and it drips everywhere and dries way too quick no matter how hot",1
15738,Nice hair dryer.  Nothing unique about it.  Just blows hot air and that's all I need!  :),4
15739,"Im ambivalent about the product but overall it makes my hair very soft and silky, it proved itself to work ok in a humid place too.",4
15740,tHE ROSE WATER REALLY SMELLS VERY GOOD AND ALSO GOOD ON SKIN WHEN MISED WITH MULTHANA MUTTI AND IT WAS SUITABLE FOR MY SKIN TOO.,4
15741,These are perfect for my three year old daughter ...she loves these :),4
15742,The art gems are extremely tiny.  How do you apply these gems?  The colors are pretty but no directions are suppied.,2
15743,These blades wear out very quickly!! II would not bIuy these again I plan to order Merkur blades next time,3
15744,Style and looks are fine. No motor power whatsoever. Maybe I got a bad one. Yah can't do nuthing with this thing. sorry!,2
15745,"I love the color but probably more suitable for younger skin.  It's very dramatic, needs to be blended well",3
15746,Very cute but shipping took forever. 2 weeks past estimated time bought for halloween they came in November. Other than that they are great.,4
15747,It is much more cheaply made than my last one. I have to set it on 6 instead of 2 as it is less powerful.,3
15748,"Its just what they said. I love this product, you have to know how use it, but Its not complicated, juts follow the instructions",5
15749,I didn't get the exact product that I was looking for but it still did the same job and works great!,4

15751,Received as expected. Works well. Easy to use and seems to keep razor working smoothly.,4
15752,"it works, pure and simple. Using a very small amount every other day keeps my nails looking healthy and groomed.",5
15753,The water pressure is too high even at the lowest setting.,2
15754,I have only used the retinol for a couple weeks...so difficult to know longer term results.  Goes on nicely.,4
15755,Very helpful as it takes away the ache and makes my hands more useable and comfortable.  Nice product at a good price.,4
15756,"Loved this conditioner for my dry, damaged and knot prone hair. Will get it again.",5
15757,This bar lathers well and smells great. It is also gentle on natural hair.,5
15758,showed assorted colours...received only one colour that wasn't even shown. Should have been noted in the description somehow. Would not reorder,2
15759,Not good at all!  This is an over-rated item!,1
15760,I didn't think that they were sharp enough.  The tip of the clipper is really dull and flat.  I wouldn' recommend.,1
15761,If you are looking to buy a bunch of this on Amazon you must already use it and like it.,4
15762,There great only thing I dislike is they hurt after about 2 hours and leaves a mark but it fades in about an hour,5
15763,The lotion itself is fine but the pump does not work so I have to shake it out of the bottle in order to use it.,3
15764,I have been using this product for about two weeks with excellant results. Also it is very well designed.,4
15765,Nothing special for the price.  Not understanding the hype for the product.,3
15766,"I would go with the water flossers that you could attach to your sink or shower instead, much more convenient.",3
15767,Its a fun game BUT it keeps crashing! and steam support won't help me! this sucks i have something unplayable sitting on my hardrive,3
15768,it's good for sleeping and stuff but you could never wear these during the day with your shoes,3
15769,"Very thin, very cheap, but they get the job done. You sure get a lot! Would be perfect for those little girl glamour parties!",3
15770,The very best I've seen in a loooooooon time!,5
15771,"spring already popped out after using it twice. received Jan 2016. Came apart March 2016.
was after 30 days so couldn't return",1
15772,"After less than 2 months, this monitor does not work! And the readings were quite different back-to-back.

A real waste of money!!!!",1
15773,"it is ok,  haven't seen a dramatic change to be honest",3
15774,Have used others so I will say they just ok.,3
15775,"Be careful with this stuff, it's not all fun and games... It gave me a horrible case of pink eye.",1
15776,It works good. its takes a little longer if wet or your hair is a little long. Works good on sensitive areas no pinching anywhere.,4
15777,"Pictures do not represent actual item delivered.
The pictures show studs but we received a bag of corkscrew nose rings.
Very disappointed.",1
15778,"It was ok, messy, the waxing strips were bad cloth and flimsy. It was good in lots of ways but some ways not some much",3
15779,feels good.  doesnt smell perfumey. chc chc chc chc chc chc chc chc chc chc chc chc chc chc c,4
15780,Works but feels a bit greasy. Couldn't use on my t-zone.,3
15781,Shipping wasn't fast. One of my belly rings is missing a ball. Many multiple of colors.,2
15782,This product made my skin break out horribly. I experienced a break out this bad in 7 years.,1
15783,Can't really put it on my ear.. Wouldn't really suggest it,2
15784,It does not heat well and the nozzle does not staybon.,2
15785,"Broke as I put it on the first time, you get what you pay for...",1
15786,"They are ok, they dull faster in my opinion. I prefer derbys or personnas",3
15787,This product is excellent for a mouth wash or for irritations in the mouth.  It is easy to use and does what it is supposed to do.,4
15788,"I like this but it doesn't always stay where you adjust it to, but besides that it is really cute",3
15789,"Great stand, feels very sturdy and looks nice in the bathroom with my husband's razor.",4
15790,Bought this as an inexpensive gift for the wife a while back. Turns out she loves using this product more often than her other higher price perfumes.,5
15791,I am so happy with Porter's Liniment and Salve.  Have looked for this product for years!!  Thank you for carrying this product.,1
15792,I  like it very much for my shaving evrry day.,4
15793,These are very sharp! Do a great job of trimming my hair.,4
15794,Not as moisturizing as Sally Hansen.  Is a nicer smell.,3
15795,"Made my hair brittle and dull looking, didn't do anything for the itch or dandruff.",1
15796,No changes! Very sticky this is not working for me. I'm on my second bottle. Please send me a refund,1
15797,"Works well, not super comfortable though. A bit to dark to see anything. Good value",4
15798,"I have used this once, so far I think it will do what it says. Waiting on my face crme.",4
15799,Not impressed with this product.  Helps some with acne but no better than any other product we have tried.,2
15800,I would not recommend it .  Regular eyelash curler is better.,1
15801,This is a great product! only thing is it is kinda loud. other than that I'm satisfied :),1
15802,"Not good for Europe  because  of the
Hertz,  even though they claimed  it is  compatible .
Giving the money to a charity organization would have been  better.",1
15803,The wax it comes with takes off more than just hair :(,1
15804,"Don't bother with it - it works great, but died after 2 months of semi-weekly usage.
Really disappointing.",1
15805,"Too bad , it's just fit with the small size
I wear 38 b and i could not use it",1
15806,"A good traveler yet for the price small, plus if it's warm Becarefull it squirts out all over",2
15807,This made my face breakout in red blotches. I do not recommend for pale or sensitive skin.,1
15808,Not the color advertised. I received a brown one instead of purple. It looks and feels like a regular silk scarf nothing fancy.,3
15809,This product is very moisturizing. It just has a very strong shea butter scent that I have to get used to.,3
15810,If you want to smell like an orange creamsicle go for it. Otherwise gross!!,1
15811,I have seen an improvement in my gum and know the Waterpik has made an difference.,4
15812,"It's your basic moisturizer. It helped with my dry cuticles, but I think vaseline would have worked the same.",4
15813,This product only worked  once and something happened and it doesn't  warm up. The light turns on but no heat,1
15814,Trying something new and my husband enjoys it.  Have no problems with it; just make sure you sterilize it before and after using.,4
15815,Stuff works well but now i'm worried that all these chemicals were really bad for me.,4
15816,"Good product.  However, something in it causes my feet to itch.",4
15817,I use this grape seed oil on my natural hair to seal in moisture. It's light and doesn't weigh your hair down.,4
15818,"This item does not cut the hair, it just likes to rip them out, doesn't work, don't bother. I returned mine.",1
15819,Works great I get 3 or 4 shaves a blade at this rate all my blades will last a full yr,4
15820,I love this thing.  Target has something like it but it is not as good.,5
15821,"This is Luis A's wife: My husband absolutely loves this soap, but it's so small and expensive, hence the -1 star",4
15822,Bad product it gave me a yeast infection i know TMI and it smell and feel like hotel soap NO MOISTURE AT ALL ,1
15823,The taste is so bad I had to throw it away on my first try. It's like Chinese herbal medicine (the bad kind).,1
15824,This lotion has a nice flowery scent and absorbs easily. It makes my skin feel smooth and silky. I would reccomend it to everyone.,4
15825,I've been using this product religiously for over a month and see absolutely no change. Big disappointment!,1
15826,"Worked great for three weeks then caught fire inside, smoked and died.",1
15827,"Strong tasting but it actually made my husband's and my teeth whiter after about a week, using once a day before bed.",5
15828,This has been my fav for years! They don't make it anymore. Just wished they had the lotion to go with it!!,5
15829,I like it but it isn't a real nice one but the price isn't real high either.,4
15830,"Does exactly what it claims, bottle lasts a long time.  Useful for keeping proper consistency of your nail polish.",5
15831,"I bought this for my wife. Whenever she turns it on, this little box roars like a jet engine. Really disappointing.",1
15832,"Made his face red and bumpy every time he used it, so needless to say we don't have it anymore",1
15833,"so far so good, doesnt shut off in 2 minutes like the POS Vidal Sasoon one I have does",4
15834,Wished that this product had the original ingredients as before.,4
15835,"It didn't match my hair color, but GREAT customer service!!!!",3
15836,"This product was not the same consistency as the normal product I buy from the salon or store. It's way too gooey, and not usable.",1
15837,I cannot believe how well this works. I wish I had found it sooner.,5
15838,The burnt sugar smell was a bit overwhelming for me.  I used it only once.,2
15839,I received my order in the mail yesterday & the wavecap has a tear in the stitching already .,1
15840,It is so cute!  Just love it!  Makes me look like my two black cats!,5
15841,This will keep your teeth clean and your gums healthy.  I am sure it is tooth fairy approved.  We actually have one in each bathroom.,5
15842,I received this in a timely manner.  It seem to be quality work. Anxiously waiting to wear it.,4
15843,I love the color . The texture . It's become one I my everyday lipsticks to wear . Getting ready to purchase another one .,4
15844,It covers the grays but doesn't last til the next wash.,3
15845,"Fairly nice stand.  The brush doesn't fit easily into the holder as we thought it would.  But for the price, it's just fine.",3
15846,Love this skin care line! Fast delivery and good price,5
15847,The only bad thing is that I found him in the picture looks different colors but to apply the same shade leaves,3
15848,This trimmer is fairly basic. It has the attachment but it's battery powered and cannot get wet. Overall it serves it's purpose.,4
15849,"Funky smell, doesn't hold hair very well defeating the purpose of a hair spray.",2
15850,I love that I got it this cheap on here! I love the scent and bought this for my boyfriend's step father and he loves it!,5
15851,Product arrived Ina timely manner and was exactly as listed. Would buy again.,4
15852,This cologne smells pretty good. The smell is much like a pine smell.,3
15853,I have been using this for a month and have experienced no results yet. I will return if nothing happens soon.,1
15854,"It works, but not worth the money. Very uncomfortable",2
15855,It came in the mail broken in pieces. so hard to apply,1
15856,I have super sensitive ears and this one works well. It was a good purchase.,4
15857,My daughter has super fine hair and this product does not work as well as some others we have tried for her hair.,2
15858,This brush was so small NOT medium. Was gonna return it but it got lost among a pile of mail. Money wasted.....,1
15859,Bought 2 of these stools. After 3 months of  mild use one wheel broke off . After another 2 months one  wheel of other stool broke off.,1
15860,As a Cosmetology student these have come in handy.  Used on manikins and live clients.,5
15861,Buy this stuff for your wife. She'll love you even more!!,5
15862,"This blush stands up to its description, it's a very natural color, not too pink. I would recommend it for light complections like mine",4
15863,Great product for clean face. It smells natural and made my skin soft.  The power of roses!,4
15864,Pretty small bulb but I'm sure it's still getting the majority of my face as I move it around.,4
15865,the one i got never screwed on right so i never got to wear it,2
15866,"colors nice, size small, nothing wet about them...quite dry hard to smoothe on",3
15867,"I ordered this for my mom, who is undergoing chemotherapy and it works great for keeping her warm at night.",4
15868,Dry lipstick but good color. Need to wear a moisturizering gloss over it.,3
15869,It doesn't work properly with my Conair mirror. The light comes on and you can't turn it off by tapping on the mirror base.,2
15870,"Water floss works great, toothbrush tip not so good.",3
15871,very bad it stuck to my daughter  skin and pilled the skin off. she have round marks on her hand.,1
15872,I used this one time a day with reverse osmosis water and YL oils and it lasted about 3 weeks..I'M NOT IMPRESSED!!,1
15873,I wouldn't recommend this product.  It's just permanent markers and some alcohol wipes.,2
15874,"I loved what this did to my hair, but it just stopped working after a few months. You get what you pay for.",2
15875,"OK but don't seem to clean as well as  Reach,",4
15876,Decent razor haven't had many issues with it. Keeps my body smooth with ease. Im happy with my norelco shaver.,4
15877,Clean and refreshed after applying. I follow up with a serum and moisturizer.,4
15878,I love the smells haven't used it yet but smells great,5
15879,Usually wears out around the plastic ring and may fall out before you wear it down. Still a good product.,4
15880,Looked very nice. Wife seems to like them very much.,5
15881,"Creamy, without the greasy feeling, can cover blemishes. Best to apply before foundation for full coverage. No break outs for me.",4
15882,Purchased this makeup as an alternative to bare Mineral. This make up is Very clogging to the pores and provides no coverage whatsoever. Terrible product.,1
15883,Didn't help my baby's eczema but I think my baby has really sensitive skin....,3
15884,very nice looking bowl & came in a timely manner.,5
15885,nice cream but could not tell a difference in my face,3
15886,It was a great product that was hard to find but was at a reasonable price and very well appreciated,5
15887,Used new batteries after only one use on hair that is not 'barb-wiry' or thick; not very economical to use.,2
15888,Great blow dryer for the price.  The only downfall... the attachment falls off very easily... frustrating!,4
15889,"Beat mosturizer hands down ...
Use it for neck ..face ..eye area...
Fine lines will Diminish and dry spots will be gone ...
Honest review ...",5
15890,Looked just like picture. And better quality than expected. It's a nice addition to our bathroom.,4
15891,"This is a great daily moisturizer for my face. Beeswax makes the difference.

Cons: Has no SPF",5
15892,It lasts for around 3-4 hours on me without a primer. The color is a stunner.,4
15893,"This water pick is great. It has attachements to clean the tounge even!
You can adjust the pressure from practiclly nothing to strong. Strongly reccomend",5
15894,"The packaging was apparently different from the one that I saw on the website.
I found it something of a disappointment.",2
15895,"The bottles are a good size, would definitely repurchase.",4
15896,I installed them and they worked.  They shave like they are supposed to.. the price was great and the ship time was good.,5
15897,The fall right off.  What a joke. Horribly cheap Chinese trash like everything else made in china.,1
15898,"Did not work for my mirror. Again, being cheap doesn't pay. I bought Conair insteadperfection.",2
15899,"I used this for deodorizing my bath room, and I was disappointed with the results. I probably will not buy this again.",2
15900,so far so good! just started with this product. will stay in touch..,5
15901,"It's a great idea, but it unravels a little more every time I use it.",3
15902,A good product but would like more variety in the colors.  A variety of browns would be appreciated.,4
15903,Great for travel so I don't have to take several products.,4
15904,this product functions admirably. it is slightly superior to an earlier version that has begun leaking. it uses very little space and i consider it perfect.,4
15905,better than some other ones I have used in the past.,4
15906,Good product. Very old breath freshening trick. Basically parsley oil wrapped in a nice minty capsule.,4
15907,This product doesn't even work! This is just made in China piece of s***!,1
15908,"I did not realize that it had a sparkle quality to it.  However, I do like it.",4
15909,I love it lol but its really heavy but it lovely ty,3
15910,Good product. It does what it is supposed to do.,4
15911,"The scent is somewhat pungent, slightly offensive for my taste.  Never got a compliment when wearing it, so its hard to make a recommendation..",3
15912,Bought it to make magnesium oil out of...best to use Costco brand if you're not caring about authentic ancient minerals.,4
15913,"A little too rough and stiff for my tastes. Some might appreciate it, but I was expecting different.",3
15914,Had a hard time finding the size I wanted but found it on Amazon.  It works great....,4
15915,Do not buy these this is a ripoff.... only received 1 not a four pack... received 12/15/2017,1
15916,This is a good product.  It keeps the skin from drying out and promotes healing.,4
15917,Way too long for my ear but I have sensitive ears and it didn't infect them.,4
15918,Both were bent on arrival and the beads in the middle was out this was by far the worst piece of cheap jewelry iv bought.,1
15919,"The formula works, but it is opaque whitish in color and has to be removed in the morning or it clumps.",2
15920,Yes!  These drops dry my nail polish so fast i can hardly believe it.  I will def be buying this again.,5
15921,The lid was not secure and some of the product leaked in the packaging.,3
15922,Returned it because my razor was old and no longer worked.,1
15923,I used mine once and it stopped working...it shuts it's  self off every 1to 2 seconds! A waste of money!!,1
15924,You don't get what's in the picture. But I like them. I switch them like every 2 weeks or so.,3
15925,"This is a 16G belly ring which i was upset about, since your pierced with a 14G unless u went to a inexperienced piercer.",1
15926,Smells good and leaves my hair really shiny.  Good price too,4
15927,This stuff is gooey and doesn't absorb quickly into the skin,2
15928,This product is not good very hard to work with the braiding hair tangled very difficult to work with threw mine in the garbage,1
15929,"I like the idea of getting between teeth, but need more practice in not getting water everywhere.  It does take up a lot of counter space.",3
15930,"pretty good
I love the product, this color just wasn't for me.",3
15931,The stand is beautiful and sturdy.  It came at a great value and in a reasonable amount of time.  Love it.,5
15932,Received none of the belly rings that the picture showed. Very disappointed,1
15933,"very nice assortment of colors , very nice investment for the money spent, wish it did not take so long to arrive",4
15934,I always feel better when I'm taking these- I can tell when I run out!,5
15935,My husband has had his electric razor for years and this is the first time we have needed to replace the heads. He loves them,5
15936,It was all mess up. You need to make sure its wrap better. I would sent it back but it wouldn't be worth it.,3
15937,My granddaughter LOVED it! She couldn't wait to show all her friends. I really liked the size of it too.,5
15938,Good product the person I bought it for loves it.,4
15939,Great product. Cleans thoroughly with nice fragrance and lots of lather.,4
15940,"Not even close to what I had expected and it cant be returned, don't buy this.",1
15941,I discovered a similar product in Spain in 1998 and have been using American versions of it ever since--The Helen of Troy is by far the best,5
15942,I love all the colors but they're big. When i put em on it hurts.,2
15943,Oxidized on my skin. Beware if I have oily skin. Shipping and seller were great on the other hand.,2
15944,It was hard to clean and after some time it started smelling bad after all my cleaning attempts. So I stopped using it,2
15945,"Great product to put on after shaving, for cuts, acne and bug bites. I highly recommend it. This  product is a must.",4
15946,Only been using this for a couple of weeks.  The jury is still out,3
15947,"When I ordered this I thought there were supposed to be two of the brushes, only received one.",2
15948,"I bought this to be a dupe for my MAC ""Faux"" and it's perfect.",5
15949,Only soap I use - and give as gifts.  Pre de Provence. !!!,5
15950,It took 3months foe s/h and when I received them they where bent.,1
15951,"So cute but it rusted fast. I'm still wearing it with my bathing suit, it just looks like rose gold lol",3
15952,More shiny than the photo i was expexting a flat finish. Not screen accurate.,3
15953,excellent to repel but spray cap broke on the first day.  Had to pour out when needed.,3
15954,"Doesn't really adhere very well. I will stick with my ""Star"" brand that lasts better and stays longer.",3
15955,My loves it so much except that the handle is much bigger for little kids,4
15956,I thought the handled and the brush were a bit smaller than pictured.  The brush and handle I was using was about 30% larger.,3
15957,His shave comes out much smoother with this cartridge as opposed to the one with fewer blades.,4
15958,"Easy to use and my Dentist recommend a water pick ,to help with my gums. So far very satisfied,with the way it cleans.",4
15959,"It's small, smells awesome and my sister love it!!",4
15960,It turns out this product was not applicable to my model razor.  I returned it for a refund.,3
15961,"Another great product from Burt's Bees!
My skin feels AMAZING and feels so soft.
It's also NOT harsh on the skin.",5
15962,Do not buy! Two of the rings were missing stones and others crooked.. spend a little more and get something better!,1
15963,I have to bang it around to get it work. It works about 20% of the time. Super disappointed.,2
15964,Bought to replace my Ebony brown Black Opal...hated this. Too greasy and didn't blend well for me.,1
15965,This really works. Good stuff. So glad to find it.,5
15966,"Bowl it's ok I expected the same finish on the inside, wood feels low quality but I will give it a chance.",3
15967,The product lasted a couple of months before overheating and now barely runs for longer than a minute.  Will never buy this again.,1
15968,Loved it. Used for the baby shower instead of makin onesies,5
15969,"It's a handle for a razor. It's comfortable, but there's not really anything else to say about something so simple.",4
15970,this is kinda cheap looking. Packaged in a piece of plastic. It was a gift so I was hoping for a little better package.,3
15971,"Great for the RV and camping.  Bugs stay out.  Same for the backyard gathering.  Insulated, not so much.",4
15972,Sometimes requires suction to start the flow of water through the tube,3
15973,"These suck, wouldn't stay on and when they did they weren't non slip.",2
15974,very cheap materials i try 2 use the stikers in won't come off/////// wy they sale something like this como onn,1
15975,Great color and size for nails. Easy to use and looks great anytime you do not feel like polishing nails.,4
15976,This item was exactly as advertised ....even surprised me with some odd shaped bags....loved it,5
15977,This hand is like the size of a five year old. It is to hard to work with because of the size.,1
15978,The rough side is useless.  The loofa side works just as you would expect a loofa to work.,4
15979,"Love the scent, great deal for the price, large bottle",5
15980,"can be a bit messy (water splashing all over the place even when on the lowest power), but still very good!",4
15981,"The necklace was good, the ring was a little rusty tho and the plastic(?) on it fell off.",4
15982,"It's definitely fake and for a fake frequenc not cheap at all, it lasts for 10 to 15 minutes.",1
15983,I am not too satisfied with this flosser. as it leaks from the handle while flossing,3
15984,"It seems to be under powered. Have to go back over face several times, does not give a clean shave the first time.",3
15985,"I only used once, battery doesn't seen to last long.
While charging, your will not be able to use it... drawback.

Luiz",4
15986,Be careful using this sunscreen. It is hard to know where it has been correctly applied and even when applied correctly it rubs off really quickly.,2
15987,"All cards here
Only thing is they came a little bent on the sides but after I put the cards in them it should be fine",4
15988,Very pretty but the alligator clips are very difficult to work,2
15989,its not the exact color it seems a tiny bit darker but i like it for the price its also long enough.,4
15990,Cheaply made. First time I used 1 of the brushes it came apart,1
15991,Excellent. Did my pinky and it lasted 3 weeks very happy with purchase,5
15992,One of the blue cords was almost broken when I got it.,3
15993,"I ordered this because it said that it was the original just bigger bottle, but it smell like my dogs flee shampoo. Works good though.",3
15994,"so far so good as it seems to clean where my electric brush can't,  Time will tell more,",4
15995,It's getting harder and harder to find Silk Whimsey anywhere.  I was happy to find it and am pleased with it overall.,4
15996,carefully guys this product make a lot of damage on my face,1
15997,This product installed easily and works well. I will probably continue to buy these replacements every couple of years to keep my razor working like new.,4
15998,"Bought it to see if it had the mini lip swatch in the bottom, it did! The application is super smooth and light.",4
15999,What can you say.  it is a nice stand and seems well built,5
16000,It was a nice facial cream. i would want to buy the kit again.,4
16001,"Great clips for keeping heavy up and out of your way when styling,",5
16002,Works for cold and hot sensitivity but not for sweet and salty sensitivity at eroded enamel spots. Kind of burns when applying.,4
16003,"This smell takes a little getting used to, but if you have battles lice with two little girls, you would smell like any bug spray.",4
16004,"Very strong woodsy smell.  Would work well in a candle or incense, but not recommended for adding to lotions or as a perfume.",2
16005,I wet my brush that I apply this with and the color lasts alllll day.... even through my lunch time work outs!!,5
16006,Bought it for my 90 year old mother - she LOVES IT!,5
16007,Arrive ahead of time happy about that and brushes are soft and very pretty nothing was broken excited to test them out !,4
16008,I dislike this product completely.. It does not stay in place. the gel comes out from the heart...  waste of money and poor quality,1
16009,I have dry but oily skin this seems to help moisturize deeper and last longer without feeling oily,4
16010,"purple don't work, hasn't for a few months now, but every other color works. love these for easy curls with no heat",4
16011,"Bottle is made of super thin plastic. Dents and crushes easily. Sprayer works good, stream and mist.",2
16012,The razor and brush stand is PERFECT!  My son loves it!  Service and delivery were great!  Thanks!,5
16013,This is a gorgeous wooden bowl and typical shaving soap fits very nicely.,4
16014,The hoops are huge and they did not come in multicolor. All hoops were purple. Way to big to wear anywhere but upper ear lobe.,1
16015,this product doesn't accomplish much and cannot be returned due to it's toxicity.  It's not worth the money or potential health risks,1
16016,Very sticky formula. Needs a moisturizer be for application. Stays on very well though.,4
16017,This is exactly what the picture describes but better . The leather of the braid is outstanding! Would buy again,5
16018,It did what it was supposed to do stop the pan,3
16019,Too light weight. Feels fake and also hot air not so strong.,2
16020,This is my first time using a product specifically designed for this area.  No pinching or pulling so far. Gets the job done.,4
16021,I have light brown hair with pale skin tone. This color looks amazing. I would definitely recommend this color and brand.,5
16022,It really made my curls defined and gave it a great lasting shine .  I will be ordering this again,4
16023,I use this product every day for shaving.  Braun is a very special product in my house hold. The products were delivered on time.  Thank You,4
16024,nice little pair of scissors at a great price ... really happy,5
16025,"they don't fit my nose, they're way to big",1
16026,I have been tanning for 3 years and this is the worst product I have ever used and I will never use it again,1
16027,Very light on but do not like scent...personal preference..,4
16028,"This product is pretty good, but it took over 10 days longer for me to receive it!",3
16029,Great product - smells nice and moisturizes your cuticles well!,5
16030,i like this product i just got it so am new on this but so far.. good !!!! ;) !,4
16031,Very nice fragrance. Deeply aromatic. Try mixing it with rose essential oil. Wow!,4
16032,Gave this organizer to our four daughters for Christmas; have not heard from any of them so I cannot comment.,3
16033,First new iron I've bought in years & I love it,5
16034,Easy to use.  My hair is on the shorter side so it works well but I doubt long hair would dry easily.,4
16035,"Clean, light, good scent, keeps my hair in place with a natural look. Only miss is containers are a bit small",4
16036,"This trimmer lasted slightly less than 3 months. Just long enough for the warranty to expire. Great trimmer, but you'll be buying another soon.",1
16037,I just started taking these.  I will know more as I have future blood work done.,4
16038,Very good Product. I am pleased. Leaves Hair nice and shiny plus it smells nice. The price however is a little high in my opinion.,4
16039,Very dry and dark..color description needs to be more advanced.,2
16040,"Good for polishing your toes, but do not work for walking. Thought that they would work as individual separators, but I was wrong.",3
16041,I like them. Good price. I wanted to have little bit bigger gems(catchers) and black color gems tho.,4
16042,It was okay i want buy again smell like a smell for a guy.......,4
16043,The ball at the bottom is too large. It can't fit my pierced nose.,1
16044,"The dispenser works well, but I have a feeling it wont' last that long. The plastic use is very thin.",3
16045,"I ordered two ""four packs"" of this product and four of the eight containers were open allowing the product evaporate and dry out.",1
16046,Have tried quite a few brands and this one did NOT disappoint ! They are sharp and close shaving and no cuts !!,4
16047,"Flemsy and cheaply made, they sent me a pink one and I look really weird as a guy",2
16048,Dislike. Soft wax is very messy. Hard to use. Wouldn't recommend to any one.,1
16049,I really like the durability of the product. It doesn't break and I like the minty taste to it!,4
16050,"The bag is made great. For the price you can try the brushes, won't replace the set you already have but might give you back up",3
16051,"Love these. I've been giving jewelry I buy on here to friends, and encouraging them to check it out.",4
16052,Very disappointed in this purchase!  The soap samples all smelled like a very strong men's soap.  None of the samples were appropriate for a women!,1
16053,Bought it for Myself as well as for my son. Received within a few days. Great product. User-friendly. Easy to clean.,4
16054,You have to buy cream applicator as well drives price up.,3
16055,Nice product for the moneyu. Works great. Quick Shipment/,4
16056,Product works great.  I have to keep with it or my daughter knows when it is off but works great.,5
16057,A very good shaver for the price. Performs well and cleans easily. Shave is close and smooth. A charge lasts all week.,4
16058,this braclet is to cute! the charms an accent pieces were a little smaller than expected but still cute :),4
16059,This is okay. Looks a little cheesy and dry. I'd like to try a different color maybe. It does stay on well though.,3
16060,The product expires within one month of receipt of the product.,2
16061,Oder does not remain in the bathroom as I had expected.,4
16062,"stop working after first use .. pump not working..

great concept but bad quality ..

one star more than enough ..",1
16063,I am very pleased with this product.  I had the opportunity to try it and I feel that my hair seems less dry.,4
16064,"According to my expectations.
It repaired my skin in the regions where I had some problems.
I will go on with it.",3
16065,Tube connecting water reservoir to the hand handle is leaking.,2
16066,Its good..used it for my psoriasis..no change there but used for a burn and helped tremendously..would buy again,4
16067,"Got those for my niece, she loved them, but I did notice they peel away when applied under clear coat of gel polish.",4
16068,Works great!  I highly recommend it for healthy teeth.,5
16069,I received the lipstick damaged ( melted).Very disappointed.,1
16070,This is the best beauty secret!  I will always buy this product.  My chest looks so much younger and prettier!,5
16071,It's missing the front cap. Should I return? Let me know,1
16072,I always keep six or seven of these under the kitchen sink and a couple in the car just in case... just in case.,5
16073,"I have fine, but curly hair and this works the best for the money. never feels built up, always feels clean.",5
16074,The straightener works great but it makes my hair smell burnt and damaged.,4
16075,This may protect the skin but it doesn't really provide a better adhesive when used in conjunction with your glue.,4
16076,Works great!  I highly recommend it for healthy teeth.,5
16077,useful  but bit pricey for the small amount in the bottle.,4
16078,"Used it ONCE and the next day, the power would not come on.  Not sure this was a smart buy.",1
16079,Many males as well as females have complimented me on the smell. Small bottle makes it easy to travel with.,4
16080,Very very thick cream and very strong smell leaves my hands with a lot of oil left on them not for me,2
16081,"In the description it states this product comes with a tongue cleaner, but the tongue cleaner was missing. Shipping was prompt and everything else is fine.",2
16082,"Great Stuff, love it and recommend the seller, fast with fullfilment",4
16083,Great! Been wanting something like this for a long time.,4
16084,"This is a perfect blush.  It lasts FOREVER. It is a great, great, great color. Either the name scares you or entices you.",4
16085,"I have had several water pics in the past, but this is by far the best one I have seen.",5
16086,The fact that this product arrived without a box OR EVEN A SAFETY SEAL is concerning. I may go back to purchasing directly from Dermalogica.,1
16087,Haven't seen any real difference but it has a pleasant smell,4
16088,I only received one of what should be a double pack.,1
16089,Waaaay longer than stated. Mad. Bought to complete a Halloween costume. Now I either have to get another from a different seller or just go without,1
16090,"Nothing to brag about. Size is ok, material is ok. Kind of wanted them to be a bit softer to the touch.",3
16091,The recipient was thrilled with this shampoo. The recipient uses it all the time and comments constantly how nice it is.,4
16092,To bulky looking on nails. Need a magnifying glass to see some of them!,1
16093,Work boots cause my feet to itch. This stuff helps out alot.,4

16095,"Great product, much cheaper than going through your dentist.",5
16096,"Got this, tried it for 2 weeks and my face broke out more than before! Back to looking for that miracle cure for cystic acne.",1
16097,"Decent wooden bowl, needs a protective coating in order to last longer.",4
16098,"The green was very light, on the heavier duty side.  It didn't seem to work at all on the thin side.",3
16099,Bought at a salon in town at list price...this was a great savings!! And I think it actually is helping with my skin!,5
16100,"it's exactly I'm looking for!

Thank you very much!",3
16101,The heads are not as good as what you get with the new shaver. Expensive for the quality that you get,3
16102,Works but not the best solution for ED. Maybe someday in the future a etter idea will come along that does not require surgery or medication.,4
16103,This is my favorite lipstick sealant.  Works very well.,4
16104,"I like it, it does a great job - it is however pretty darn loud.",4
16105,I love that this is free of harsh chemicals and it makes my three year olds hair look & smell amazing,5
16106,Used it for three days in a row and immediately saw results (hair is becoming thicker),4
16107,Nice product. Floss thoroughly to keep my teeth free of residue. I've never tried anything else since I started to use this one.,4
16108,"Rapid delivery and a great price for a super product.  the flosser is easy to use, easy to maintain, and does a great job.",5
16109,The arch supports feel good and offer me the support I need.  If these wear out I will not hesitate to order them again.,4
16110,"It massages the gums, and flushes between the teeth. Several heads for different effects. Fill the reservoir with warm water.",4
16111,A seriously bad blade..  I used one out the package of 100 and I will definitely throw away the rest.,1
16112,I've hacked open over a dozen young coconuts with this thing and it still seems to be going strong.  It's heavy and solid.,4
16113,"am a little early but bought for Christmas presents for 2 ""girlie girls""  who will be very happy as I am with the sets.",5
16114,The toe seam is no longer flat and is lumpy instead.  Rubs on my toes.  Not happy with the change.,1
16115,Not a fan. Going back to (more expensive) Image C Moisterizer,2
16116,"Worked well on my back, but not so much on my knee.",3
16117,"Works great for dry skin. Oily, however, so be aware of that.",5
16118,Great cleanser soap at an equally great (high) price.,5
16119,color bled but it worked i stil like the pink or black one better,3

I couldn't find one any perfume shop i go to so buying this.",5
16122,Works very well.....makes my mouth and gums feel clean...recommended by my dentist .I recommend to anyway one who has gingivitis and gum problems,4
16123,Love the smell. Not sure that it's a good fit for my fine but ample hair. It felt a little dry.,3
16124,"again not made in the USA , the product works well and cleans your teeth nice , it does what it was made for",4
16125,Decent cheap brush set. It works well for a travel set but I would not use them for daily use.,3
16126,It did not performed the way it was supposed to.  The blade wasn't sharp. It did not trim the side burns.,1
16127,I really like the Gillette clear gel. It seems to do a decent job of controlling sweat and smell issues.,4
16128,It looks so cute when I put it on but it leaves a mark/scar on my nose So I can't wear it that often,3
16129,I got the large but it's dinky and won't stay on.  A satin pillow case would be better.,1
16130,It's just okay for me. I like the formula...,3
16131,Much smaller. I have one from last year and the new much is much smaller.,3
16132,The person I bought it for said it was just fine. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9,4

16134,"It was cute, compact and easy to use. Will be perfect for travel Fun! A great stocking stuffer for my adult daughter.",4
16135,I'm surprisingly liking this flavor. I usually do not like mouthwash that isn't mint flavor but this is pretty good.,5

16137,I like the smell and its very light. Package came on time. I did not have any problems. Would recommend.,4
16138,Very pretty and good buy for the price.  Will use often.,4
16139,We all enjoying it!!! Great flosser!!! Thanks,5
16140,Feel the burn but notice the difference of the appearance of your skin. I used it while in a sauna.  Helped heat my skin up quicker.,4
16141,The rings were of good quality but I got a lot of repeated designs. They didn't look like on the picture.,2
16142,"it is very gentle to the skin but it is still a very good facial cleanser, i absolutely love it",5
16143,These should work. They are smaller than the old ones. My wife is slow to try something new.,3
16144,"Description of product was very informative. No need for pre-shave lotion, can be used in shower and easy clean up using water.",4
16145,Great! Fun! Mirror is the only thing that would make it better,4
16146,"Does the job, but takes a while to heat up. You'd want to let it heat up for a few minutes before ready to use.",5
16147,Very low pressure... would prefer to have some more power.,1
16148,Use this stuff on my Grandaughter.  The pharmacy want 55.00 as it was not covered by my insurance.  Mush beeter priced here on Amazon.,4
16149,Not  good. I buy colors #26 they send to me #32 . I don't like it. No happy.,1
16150,good quality cream  and i like the size......as i use it a lot......,4
16151,It was good at first then after couple uses the strips are sliding off the barrel terrible trying to curl my hair,3
16152,It drys very well. But I have to hold it far away from my head as it blows very hot.,4
16153,I bought my girl this thing as a gift and she loves it so much so i went ahead and bought one more.,5
16154,It does the job but a little too waxy to clean the regular teeth and get the food removed.,4
16155,"Comes off after lips touch a few times, I guess you get what you pay for, but very disappointing.",1
16156,"Not bad, but not as good as the Crystal ""SUPER +"" Stainless Steel Platinum. These are my 2nd choice blades.",4
16157,Love these blades. Been using them for two years now. Price can't be beat.,5
16158,"This product never came  It said it came two weeks early, I waited two weeks and it never showed. So disappointing.",1
16159,Fast shipping gave three because didn't take off much hair as I thought but. Will try it again to see,3
16160,Works but it's built very lightly indeed. the hose coils but is difficult to coil correctly so the wand can be clipped back on the unit.,3
16161,sex in the city kiss by instyle parfum eau de  spray has not good smell and state just for 1 minut i don not recomend,1
16162,"Nothing special, but it does what it's supposed to- hold my puck of shave soap.  Good price, seems decently made.",4
16163,some of the stones were a little crooked.. but you get multiples of one color,3
16164,Way to small for any adult. Should have been advertised for a child size costume,2
16165,"Love this product, it's amazing and does what it says it will do!",5
16166,"Nice and glittery. Bright colors. I got an extra gift,  a primer. Awesome!",5
16167,Not good quality. I do not like them nor do I suggest anyone by them,1
16168,I use this concealer to cover dark circles around my eyes.  Also to cover up age spots.  Works great.,5
16169,It was a cute bracelet but the connect part wasn't strong,3
16170,"Great product, but you should be able to spray from any angle",4
16171,"It's ok, I use this on my skin as well as my hair, good product.",4
16172,"Local anesthetic, but doesnt help with the bumps. Burns bc of the alcohol in it.",3
16173,I bought this to repair a nail crack and it worked great!,5
16174,"This is a good shaver, but not as fine as the previous models it replaced.  Fortunately, my old one also works.",4
16175,"Not green, came as white gloves didn't last very long",2
16176,I find this difficult to use. Butter is solid and hard.,2
16177,It works well at keeping my hair in place at night.,4
16178,Great product! Craftsmanship is better than I am used to seeing. Well worth the money and a totally satisfied customer.,5
16179,It smells great. My hair is on the thicker side so It holds my hair for about 20 minuets before it falls into my face.,2
16180,The only problem is it appears a bit dry which I do not need!  I use coconut oil under it to help.,3
16181,"bought to use on my boyfriend, and he loves it.",4
16182,I have a large head and these were very comfortable and stayed on no problem. Really like them.,5

16188,We used this spray consistently and got lice more than once!  Does not work.,1
16189,"Haven't used it that long but  love it, it noticably reduces lines and crowsfeet",4
16190,What can I say?  It's lipstick and I like it.  The color is what I hoped for and I'm not disappointed.,5
16191,these were some of the worst massage oils I have ever gotten.  They do not have good smells and some are very similar.  I would not recommend,1

16193,Only received 9 and one of the ones I received was missing it's gem.,2
16194,"When I plugged it in this morning, it didn't work. I will be returning it today.",1

16197,Go get a fluoride treatment at your dentist office instead!,1
16198,I have been used for a period of time. The quality of this product above my expectation. Love it !,5
16199,DESCRIPTION SAID PACK OF (4) IT ONLY CAME WITH ONE.,1

16201,The soap was leaking all over the box n it got over the item that was shipped with it. I'm very happy.,1
16202,What a rip off.  Do not buy these unless you like throwing away your money.  They were useless.,1
16203,hard to place in the right spot.  Did not work for me,1
16204,So far I'm enjoying the Pic.  I feel my teeth are much cleaner now.,4
16205,Great ointment and soap. They have helped clear up my zit-prone face. Thank you!,5
16206,"You get what you pay for. I am very happy with this purchase, but I did not expect much.",4
16207,I love this soap and watch for it to be an add on.  I always have a box available in the house.,5
16208,You can barely smell it... I bought other diffusers that work way better then this... Don't waste your money,2
16209,"Great coverage, looks a little cakey unless you put moisturizer on first",4
16210,This is the best product ever!  Helps me make it in between my salon appts without embarassing grays showing!,5
16211,Not much monomer or nail tips but good starter kit! Throw the brush away and get a 100% pure kolinsky,3
16212,Does everything you need and is very inexpensive.  The shell is made of plastic and get a little clogged when cutting hair,4

16215,"Super fast delivery, and great old fashioned product that does the job with minimal waste and responsible regard for the environment.",5
16216,"Not as good as Lasting Touch, but good value for the size and price.",3
16217,Don't really have anything to say about this I use it and blah that's it..,4
16218,"This is not a Essie product. It is fake, color on skin is orange very different from the original one. I am returning it.",1
16219,Wow!  It definitely wakes you up!  Something makes your skin tingle - a lot!,5
16220,powder is great. breast lotion clumps and makes more of a mess. will not continue to use,3
16221,Works just like it is supposed to.  Wish I could get it with a smaller barrel.,4
16222,"These goggles do come off easily, but they are good for things such as laser hair removal.",3
16223,"I would've given 5 stars, but unfortunately the packaging was damaged. Good product though.",4
16224,"DIDN'T DO ANYTHING ..., they fool the buyer with these reviews!!!",1

16227,Product did not help my son's eczema.  Disappointed.,2
16228,I really like the way my Remington shaver works but the battery doesn't charge for long.,3
16229,Works great. Smell is kind of strong at first but wears off quickly.,5
16230,This is a nice size organizer for Hobo bag purses or for other types of totes or duffles when you need to organize toiletries or smaller products.,4
16231,"The Product Features section of this product description is incorrect. This product is a denture toothpaste, not an overnight soak type of product.",4
16232,"I`ve used this brand for years, for some reason this new one isn`t as powerful as the ones I`ve had before.  Alittle disappointed.",3
16233,I love the gloves. They are very pretty. Lady-like.!!!.,5
16234,This smells good. Didn't really do much on my hair though.,4
16235,"An essential if you are considering buying a shaving brush. Small, stylish, and discreet.",5
16236,Looked everywhere for one.  Finally found it on here.  It works perfectly and is a great price!,5
16237,Trays cover a small number of teeth as well as a small per cent of each tooth. This product is one of the more expensive whiteners!,1
16238,"Absolutely love this trimmer. It works great, with no fear of cuts.",5
16239,This is my favorite shampoo bar. It leaves hair soft and shiny. I never have build up.,5
16240,the water pressure on high just slides through the teeth and cleans remarkably well. just before bedtime and better breath in the morning.,4
16241,So far so good but it does not seem to be a product that will last too long. You can see it is cheaply made.,3
16242,I'm sold on the product and will continue to purchase.,4
16243,"a real waste . I have spent my money on this useless thing . In the first use , the appliance burned .",1
16244,Great product! Worked awesome when making homemade lotion :),5
16245,"I haven't used them yet, but I have every expectation that they will perform as stated.",4
16246,Like the product.. but more so I like the availability.  Cannot find these blades in any of the major chain supermarkets or pharmacies in my area.,4
16247,Good quality product. I use it to massage my face to reduce puffiness. Seems to work well for that purpose.,5
16248,"Came looking nothing like the picture, but I'm hoping I can style it.",2
16249,Love the product... Exactly what I need it just doesn't last as long as other hot curling brushes...,4
16250,"This is for kids, chain size is so small that adult cannot use it.",2
16251,"Convenient product, I keep one of these around at all times.",5
16252,"Applies nice and evenly, I just hate that you have to reapply it so often. But nice color and it came sooner than expected. :)",3
16253,A fine product that exceeded expectations. Functional and very sturdy.,5
16254,Good product. Fast delivery. I will recommend it to my friends.,5
16255,As advertised. Works ok. Would like to see it in a brushed nickel finish.,4
16256,"No good The foam tips disintegrate the first time you use them. Waste of money.
TJ Smith",1
16257,I have used hair tape before and this stuff was not only pricy but didn't stick at all,1
16258,"This works very well; a bit noisy, but the flow is good when turned to full capacity.  It does a good job.",4
16259,"This is an A-list wannabe.  Decent scent, but not worth the $55 price tag.  Would pay $30-$40 max.",3
16260,"It's awesome and definitely works, there is just a horrible aftertaste.",4
16261,"It's VERY heavy, VERY oily and does not cover my baby mask. Color was easier to chose than I thought. Not for my face.",2
16262,Arrived broken and unusable. Found a replica of it in the $1 section at Target so I'm not too torn up about it.,1
16263,"Trimmer works quite well, especially on ""turbo"" mode.  In Turbo, the vacuum does indeed catch almost all the cut whiskers.",4
16264,"They are so cute, it has everything I need in it except for my eyelash curler. ;) I love the case too.",5
16265,"I got this set for my wife for a Christmas present.  She enjoyed it and liked the shower gels.  Good product, delivered on time.",5
16266,Arrived opened  and leaking all over the box.  Tried shampoo but didn't help at all.  Still so itchy.,1
16267,I like it. I use it nearly every day. It has held up and done what it is supposed to.,4
16268,"Wow, I under-judged the bottle size and this will last me and an entire army a lifetime!  A bit too greasy to lubricate my over-dry eyelids.",4
16269,The thickness could be improved on this tubing.  Seems a little small when compared to their competitor.,3
16270,The cap was not closed all the way. It leaked more than half of the bottle. No use.,1
16271,This works pretty well for me. I have been using for a few weeks and I can already see the improvement.,4
16272,"It helps, but not crazy about having to leave it in my braid.  Crafty person could possibly find other uses for it.",3
16273,I use this every morning before I apply moisturizer and primer.  I have been able to see an improved appearance in my skin.,4
16274,"These blades are convenient, but don't shave closely and the lubrication bars split after a couple of shaves.",1
16275,"Does the job
 But pricey go to whole sale suppliers they have this product for 6.95 1lb",2
16276,Expected more peeling. But overall was satisfied. Little pricey for one application.,4
16277,"Good products w/small bottle. It could be better w/ a big bottle for every shoes's spray...
I will suggest other people to buy.",4
16278,the brushes i received were very cheap and some of them were bent. not worth the wait or the purchase,1
16279,Probably a good supplement....but not a fountain of youth.....when will I learn?,2
16280,don't waste your money. This is the worst shaver I have ever purchased.,1
16281,My wife loves it. the battery last during the pedicure,4
16282,"great product, the only thing i hate was the way it smelled.",4
16283,"This is my first electric shaver.  It is quick and easy.  My beard isn't particularly thick, so this does the job just great.",4
16284,My daughter wears it she likes dangly one I thought it had color to it,5
16285,It is not what I thought it was suppose to be.,3
16286,"Simple to operate, love the extra clean feeling. Best proactive oral care out there!",5
16287,"ehh blush brush fell apart 2nd time I used it, but I put it back together with the hot glue gun. other than that its good.",3
16288,All attachements are made of cheap plastic that fit very loosely on the base and make very loud rattling noise.,2
16289,Very good lip moisturizer and has a great chocolate smell. The package isn't very convinient.,4
16290,"A good product a little rough, works well, but it does the job! I would Just be careful around sensitive areas.",4
16291,"Very pretty, hard to maneuver and has a weird new smell that never disappears lol",4
16292,"It's great, but it's not as easy as I thought it would be.
Water flashes everywhere and I have to wipe them off.",4
16293,This device flushes food from the pockets between my teeth unlike floss that frequently drives it in deeper which makes the situation worse.,4
16294,Love the smell. Only con is that it stings my kids eyes but other than that it is pretty good stuff.,3
16295,"Seems to go on very easily except in the folds and creases, but very convenient to carry in my golf bag for additional protection.",4
16296,No not at all. The sprayer does not work therefore cannot put on the perfume!  Not a happy camper!,1
16297,"Careful, had to replace mine.  Power went out and not quite sure how it got turned on while power was out, but burned unit out.",4
16298,Great Product have been using for years would recommend for anyone with dry skin issues..,5
16299,These scissors are very sharp. Cuts through hair with ease. Glad I purchased it.,5
16300,Doesn't trim close at all.  Even without the attachments on.  You still have to shave,1
16301,For the price you can not beat it...I like the card holder inside as well.  Very happy with it overall.,4
16302,These cones don't smell like the superhit sticks. They have a more rose type smell. I will only buy the sticks from now on.,3
16303,"I have used most of the jar, have not seen any improvement.",1
16304,Lightweight and allows my hair to retain moisture!!!,4
16305,"The shampoo is very watery, and I did not see too much of a difference in my dandruff.",2
16306,I love the clean smell conditions so well please my hair beautiful and shiny ,5
16307,This item arrived really late and it was defective. The top ball does not separate from the rest of the ring. It is a useless product.,1
16308,love the matte finish. switched back to bare minerals after years of other products I didn't like . super fast shipping and exactly as described .,5
16309,This product is very soothing for the scalp and has helped with my insomnia. I will definitely be repurchasing this product again.,5
16310,Have used it for 7 years!!!  My doctor told me about it!!!,5
16311,The toe guards did not stay in place and were completely useless!,1
16312,Just what I wanted.  I found these a few years ago and then they stopped making them.  Happy to have them in my makeup collection.,5
16313,I actually buy this for my husband!! He used to break out from shaving and applying this after he's finished has done the trick!!,4
16314,Only way I am able to shave that area.  Works great - prevents itching and redness.  Need to apply 2-3 times per day like directions say.,5
16315,"I bought this one, because my old one stopped working, right after the warranty lapsed. It does a great job.",4
16316,It is continually coming unscrewed.  I am afraid to tightened to much for fear of stripping the threads.,2
16317,It's okay.  I wind up just wearing an old T-Shirt.,3
16318,"Love it
Great quality. When it comes to amazon and saving money this is the place to do it. Thanks",2
16319,"Terrible. Returned it. Don't waste your money, it doesn't work.",1
16320,"When I bought it, I was told that I would receive a rebate, however, I receive nothing after more than three months.",2
16321,Does not work with the above product...I received credit for it,2
16322,The color was much darker than my medium brown hair. It did not cover my gray either.,1
16323,Better than what I expected!!  You can either dress this necklace up or down.  Looks way more expensive than what it actually cost.,5
16324,"shaving is quiet, quick and efficient - could not ask for anything more.

ditto ordering, billing and shipping.....",5
16325,Purchased in May....started having trouble with misting within 3 weeks...followed all instructions....now it no longer mists...UGH!,2
16326,"Works well, but very greasy.  Don't put it on and then put on good clothes or go sit on your couch.",3
16327,The stand looks good and is well made.  Only minor issue is the brush side is too narrow for a couple of my brushes.,4
16328,I like the way it cools my head and cleans my hair,5
16329,This product is great.  Goes on light and fluffy.  It doesn't have as much coverage as I would like.,5
16330,More narrow and short than I needed but I suppose I should have measured my combs.,4
16331,I LOVE LOVE LOVE these.  They really do make my feet feel much better.  I am so glad I found these on line.,4
16332,I spent over 60 dollars on waxing kit and it hardly works. i was very dissapointed with the quality of the product,1
16333,Though I haven't not used the makeup brushes the quality of them when they arrived felt good. So I can't not wait to use them.,4
16334,"very dissapointed in this. What did I expect for the price, though.",3
16335,I love this.  I really wish I had gotten one sooner.,4
16336,"I have never had an electric razor that shaves as good or better than a razor.  This one does! I am totally satisfied with my purchase,",5
16337,Either I'm using this wrong or it's a way over priced pillow...,2
16338,Kids love this and the top is easy for them to use.,5
16339,"FAKE FAKE FAKE.
i seriously cannot believe what a rip off this is.",1
16340,Cannot review at this time since it is a xmas present.  Looks like everything my wife wanted for this item.,3
16341,Works great. Only drawback is the water resorvoir is empty before I finish.  Maybe I just have not figured out how to use it properly.,4
16342,"Its pretty good to have around as an alternate aftershave.
 Feels nice on my fresh shaved face.",3
16343,Love it! Light and fluffy and great moisture. A little goes a long way.,4
16344,Love!  I have very sensitive skin and this is perfect!,5
16345,Great device for storing your old school double edge safety razor and soap brush.,5
16346,"Horrible smell - like burning electrical wires, also not effective at all",1
16347,"USED AS COMPOUNDING AGENT WITH TEA TREA OIL AND LOTRIMIN, WORKED WELL",5
16348,"I have never cut myself, or gotten a razor burn from using these. Just the best shave you can get!",5
16349,Nice scent. I use it several times a week. It may dry your face out to use it daily.,4
16350,I think it is good though I need more time to see how good are the results on my face.,3
16351,"Excellent service from PharmaFrag, and we love this Waterpick Flosser!  Best ever!",5
16352,Purchased another on E-Bay as gift a gift on Ebay for 525.00,3
16353,Neither my husband or I liked the way this deodorant smells and it gets worse throughout the day. He refuses to continue using it.,2
16354,I use this in my cold process soap as well as face masks..:) it makes pretty colors in my soap.:),5
16355,product not sturdy enough to even apply makeup. waist of money on my part. don't make the same mistake i did,2
16356,Cute for the price but cheaply made. I would spend a few more dollars for better quality of medal,2
16357,Too weak and didn't really do much at all.,1
16358,"I tried it with a pair of capri leggings, and it didn't work at all.  I'll just keep wearing long shirts over them.",1
16359,I have had many Norelco Razors.  This one is good just like all the rest.,4
16360,"This product seems to be fading in strength and ""feel."" No longer use.",2
16361,"having used much of it ,,,dont really know how to raye ir.",3
16362,I'm in so much pain! It's unbearable. ..the strip made it worse..I've been up for hours  trying  to get the pain to go away..,1
16363,Exactly as posted.  Arrived quickly.  Very good quality.  Serves its purpose well.,5
16364,Didn't really do anything. Maybe I just didn't need it.,4
16365,"Best hair products ever!!! Finally find the one that I love, definitely worth to try it, so happy...",5
16366,The suction on this mirror stopped working after about 4 months use.  It won't stick on my wall for more than 5 minutes now.,2
16367,The battery went dead only after one year. And Philips custom service said it was not uncommon.,1
16368,The only knock on this product is that the blue button to stop the flow sometimes sticks closed.  I have to pull it out with pliers.,4
16369,Just average for me.  I think Feather and Gillette Silver Blue gave me a closer shave with one more use out of a blade.,4
16370,"Nice cape, easy to wash and no need to dry.",4
16371,Lots of choices-something for everyone!  Good for children or adults-nothing offensive.  We are having fun with them!  I would recommend.,4
16372,"I rate this okay for performance.  It does add length, but not much.  A good mascara can do the same or better",2
16373,Glue melted all through my hair & ended up having to pull heaps of my hair out to remove it...,1
16374,Does not last more than a few washes. Fudge is better.,2
16375,I love these stamping polishes. They work beautifully and the colors are so vibrant! I would recommend these to all my nail artist friends!,5
16376,Didn't stay sticky for more than a few uses. Bummer!!,2
16377,This product makes a huge difference in how you feel the day after drinking. I would highly recommend it!,5
16378,...but found it on Amazon!  Lovely color and delivered to my door.  What more could I want,4
16379,No problems with the vial. I just don't like the fragrance. Others might and it's rated higher by others.,2
16380,This is a great product if you can get past the fishy smell and get the powder mixed into the right texture.,4
16381,"These are fantastic. The labels are priceless. It was a surprised to see I had to cut them out individually, but it's worth it.",4
16382,Been using this with my kids for 3 weeks and no results yet... Smells good but not sure it will work.,2
16383,"Dont buy,dose not work,i used it for 6 months,no effect.cant return it now",1
16384,Smells a little more like chemicals than I'm used to.,3
16385,My wife and I enjoy using this.  Looking forward to shorter dental visits.,4
16386,This product met my expectations however I should have purchased a four or more pack. Next time. I recommend this solution for your electric razor.,5
16387,"I have used these in the past and find them convenient.  However, I wonder if regular non iodized salt doesn't work just as well.",3
16388,I want the sparkly silver one.  Can't find it,1
16389,"And imagination, not imaginary, his teeth with the things cannot be completely clean
Air is strong, easy to cause the bleeding gums",3
16390,Black is more like a light gray color...definitely not happy with this purchase.,1
16391,"Seems a bit overpriced.  I'd like a product like this but at a bargain.  After all, this Amazon.",4
16392,Needed this last one and while it was a bit expensive...it did complete the collection.,5
16393,"Priced right, does not speead smoothly in lips and does not last long",3
16394,It makes the electric razor glide easier but it really hasn't helped with the irritation that much.,4
16395,Only got two hair cuts out of it before it stopped working.,1
16396,Tubing won't relax and is always a tangled mess. Buy something a little more thicker,1
16397,"These pics are awesome, the best floss pic for tight contacts.  I will purchase this product again.  Thanks for the fast turn around time.",5
16398,Product was okay...did not exfoliate as well as you would think it should but it did smell nice.,3
16399,"I chose this rating, because one of the individual heads, was not useable.  It must have been for another unit.",4
16400,I've used it years ago and I saw it online and decided to order.  It has a nice fragrance.,4
16401,"Initially I saw some improvement in my skin but it didn't last. So for me, this product was not effective",2
16402,Brush overheats.  I have bought several and they all overheat after several usage.  Not a good buy.,1
16403,"Havent seen results yet, but make sure you read the back of the box. Kinda scared to use it after I read it.",2
16404,"Quality comb, works great, looks good, easier to find than black combs.  Definitely recommend.",5
16405,This was recommended to me by someone.  I use it regularly & notice the positive results.,5
16406,"Products made in usa are goods. This product is like ""made in china"" not good quality. I don't speak english very well. sorry",2
16407,"They were very cheaply made, fell apart after wearing just a couple times.  :(",1
16408,"they're okay, they get the job done but I don't like how they break easily",3
16409,I did not get any positive result... Wouldn't recommend.,1
16410,Very Cute Shirt but need to order a size bigger than normal !!!,5
16411,"Great Idea... Horrible Cheap Shoddy Execution... The Inside of The Bowls Are A HOT HOT MESS!

Very Poor Quality. Best To Take A Pass.",1
16412,I did not really notice a better shave with this product vs. the Mach 3 product.  Not worth the extra expense.,3
16413,"Great lipstick- very smooth, smells and tastes good, full coverage; but the ravishing rose showed up a much brighter pink on me than expected.",4
16414,Brushes are great they don't fall apart at all and hold the make up nicely. Easy to clean,4
16415,Really a great soap with no smell to it and leaves your skin feeling clean and feeling great.,4
16416,It gave me the confidence to approach other guys. I like it so far,5
16417,It was broken when I received it and felt really cheap....,1
16418,"Cute, but very small which makes the detail hard to see. I would order it again, but only because I love anything chihuahua.",2
16419,It's a comb. I barely can feel it against my skin. I like the smell.,4
16420,It was so oily and didn't work for my eczema.,2
16421,"new look every day, have used it once a week, cuses no irritability, and it is very fast to use",4
16422,I have used this for years for my bites and rashes. I have super sensitive skin. This stuff is awesome,5

16424,"Awful! This is a terrible product. Did not work, dry and sadly those who would order need it. Remove from your stock.",1

16427,Don't know why this is so awesome. But it is. My husband loves it.,5
16428,I  really like this my dental health has improved and I enjoy how easy it is to use and store,4
16429,Very smooth and a lovely scent. Skin drinks it right in. Have been using it on the back of my thigh area....skin feels tighter.,5
16430,These absolutely suck. They brake in the matter of days . do not buy,1
16431,Causes vaginosis. Causes a naturally smelly vagina in the long run.,1
16432,This bottle cracked and leaked the first time I took it on a plane.,3
16433,I'm not sure but I have tried different ones in the past and they worked great but unfortunately this brand is not working for me! :(,3
16434,It is very easy to use and just the product I was looking for and highly I recommend it to everyone!,5

16437,"It's beautiful, bought it in remembrance of my father since he was in the Navy, and the size is perfect.",4
16438,Great light cleanser that does not dry out my skin.,5
16439,Not impressed by the hair style results after using this product.,2
16440,"So Cheap! And great quality as well, you cant go wrong buying this. Perfect for any double sided safety razor.",5
16441,This was useful for about 3 times then the seam split and began leaking air.  Such a waste of money.,2
16442,Takes so much to see any result- found I would be going through 1 bottle a week if I continued to use,3
16443,It's like using a firemans hose to clean your teeth.. Wear a poncho lol,5
16444,"Piece of junk, ""adjustable"" guard broke after 2 uses. do not buy.",1
16445,I like it very much. Every night I use it and it is useful to help you to clean your teeth.,5
16446,"Razor is like new. Nice smooth shave. We all try to get at least one more shave out of any blade, give up and replace.",5
16447,"It works, for the most part. No fragrance is a definite plus! I need eight more words; how's this? One more.",4
16448,Nice quantity for the price.  Good oil! And organic!,5
16449,Good quality. Recommended. And I would love to buy again.,5
16450,"The handmade soap I purchase, locally, is wide and does not fit into the bag very well. It might be okay for a smaller bar.",2
16451,I love this cleansing cream. I also bought the body cream. Love the smell.,5
16452,The bag and brushes are great but can be a bit hard to clean.,4
16453,"Within the last year, this is my third try at a water pick/flosser. Save your money on the lesser models. This is the real deal.",4
16454,I have been using this product for years with my lace wigs and it has helped me.,4
16455,Did not work at all and remained greasy for a long time on my dry skin.,2
16456,Product got on to my fabric within first use. Seller not helpful.,1
16457,Overall fairly well made instrument with good lighting and magnification; could be a little lighter with a smaller handle and a screw on front glass plate,4
16458,Easy to apply without getting your hands wet. Recommend it highly!,4
16459,Did not lighten my medium dark hair. A few grays remained.,3
16460,This is crap! Used for one month. Nothing. Waste of money.,1
16461,It serves it's purpose. It's a fair price.,4
16462,"Great products, the scent of roses is so beautiful.  I will explore their other lines for specific needs to my 40+ sensitive combination skin needs.",4
16463,I found at least 5 needles that had gone through the plastic so they definitely were not sterile!,3
16464,Simply a personal preference. The coconut smell was stronger than I like. I typically really love all Nubian Heritage lotions.,2
16465,"Love theses brushes, Perfect for doing detail makeup. They are soft and allow you to apply makeup well. I would recommend them.",4
16466,For alot less money you can use a panty liner and achieve the same results.  Would not recommend you spend the money on this item.,2
16467,Works as expected..  Excellent followup by retailer.  Fits my really large wrist without a problem.,4
16468,They didn't last but a few days.  The adhesive seems like it is only made to last as a quick semi fix.,2
16469,"this is great and my pups never get the puppy smells, always clean",5
16470,It works more like a curling iron since it is all plastic and doesn't have a brush.,2
16471,"Initially, my husband loved his shaver, but it didn't hold up very long.",3
16472,Gave me an irritated rash that lasted almost 1 week.,1
16473,`it is ok. it just has only two levels of blowing your hair. For this price is ok.,3
16474,As pictured there are 4 pairs of goggles.  I only received one pair which for one pair it was extremely expensive.,1
16475,Having scabbies and am undergoing medicinal treatment this is the only stuff that;  works to stop the ITCHING -  the gel works too!,5
16476,It might irritate sensitive skin because it's very minty. But my skin is alright when I use it and it cools your skin down which js awesome,4
16477,"Works pretty well without making hair hard. It does get flaky, taking on the appearance of dandruff after a while though.",4
16478,Nice buy not what I expected looks better on the model but was worth a try,2
16479,it does moisturize well but it is so incredibly greasy!,4
16480,"Love the idea here, and the 'sticky' is good.... and wish the paper was white to be able to read it easier.",3
16481,"A very good product, except that the housing is very thin plastic.  It needs to be handled with care. It does everything as advertised.",4
16482,Not a true stain- give you inner lip line- you know the one,1
16483,I like it. Works well but is overpriced for what it is. The white part has turned yellow - but that's only a cosmetic change.,4
16484,The item was a Christmas gift which was never delivered; plus no reason was given why it didn't ship,1
16485,"I knocked out one star because this gel does not dissolve in water easily. I purchased it to make baby wipes. It smells ok, though",4
16486,Nice little pens but the cap quickly loses grip and the pen easily come off and can be lost.  Not sure I would buy again.,3
16487,"this thing really works, but a bit pricey given it lasts 30 days +/-.  Wish it lasted longer, maybe design enhancement soon ?",4
16488,This item was horrible ! I barely got them in the mail 5 mins ago and two of the rhinestones fell out .,1
16489,This razor only has 3 blades which makes it very rough.  Should have bought the 5 blade which is smoother.,1
16490,"Seems like these will work, my old school metal peg hooks are very thin and may fall out too often.",3
16491,thanlk you for this product...my daughter loves it!,4
16492,"When you fill the container with water, the water runs out the bottom, leaving a mess from the sink to the water flosser.",2
16493,These are ok.  They don't really fit our tablets and the fasteners keep moving all over the place.,2
16494,Cannot read instructions - everything is written in Japanese!!,2
16495,"I am a cyclist who planned to use the shaver on my legs, but it just didn't work.",2
16496,"I'm sure its good quality, but doesn't stand out from other serums used in the past.",3
16497,"It doesn't work,  it doesn't remove hair at all.",1
16498,Not exactly what I had in mind.  They do not stay at an even temperature and just not comfortable to use.,2
16499,"I've had this product for about a month, and it works just as described.  Much easier and less time consuming than flossing.",4
16500,Great sunscreen.  Goes on smoothly and never runs down into my eyes.,5
16501,This broke after wearing it once. Not made very well,1
16502,Ok item. It works well but wood became rotten color on a week.,2
16503,I loved an til about 2 weeks ago it started making a weird noise,1
16504,Razors didn't last as long as I'd like. Definitely not as smooth of a shave as pricey drugstore brands,3
16505,I have used Braun razors for years. I have had many different models. This Braun 5-590 is OK but not great.,3
16506,"20 packages of 5
Each blade individually wrapped
Very sharp
Fits well in my cheap razor
2-3 shaves on each blade
smooth shaves each time",5
16507,"It came early which was a good thing, but the back of the earrings was bend.",3
16508,"This actually made my skin dark, so I stopped using it.",2
16509,just wish the set came with honey wax instead of cream wax which is so runny and not good for eyebrows.,4
16510,I feel I made a great choice in choosing this razor. I am still in learning process switching from a blade.,4
16511,It says it is odorless but not true! It stinks! Like bad BO,1
16512,I expected two of the large containers I had bought previously.,2
16513,Cute but it got broken even before i wore it. The horn came off the glue they used is cheap.,3
16514,Don't buy!!!!  Came all broken and in tarnish silver not colored.,1
16515,"It works like is should, but it's kind of hard to clean.",4
16516,"Soft silky hair, but extremely ill fitting. Can't get this wig to stay put.",2
16517,too light for my afro-caribbean skin tone. i had to give it away.,2
16518,"Timely shipping, as described, Super nice would purchase again.",5
16519,So far have not had any issues with these but they do not appear to last more than a few shaves,4
16520,this is really nice shaver.  The only problem I have is this burns my skin and my face is inflamed for several hours after using this.,3
16521,tape was too expensive. we always paid twenty five dollars for a package  of six.  this was  what we  expected to pay,1
16522,Wife has enjoyed this product. Glad to find it in Amazon,4
16523,"product and very good. recommend this product .. excellent
packaging easy. for practical use. performs miracles.
toos use here at home. we're loving",5
16524,"I was expecting something less substantial (extremely delicate), but these little earrings are very sturdy and I really like the way they hang.",5
16525,Puts out very little air. If you have thick hair this will not work for you.,1
16526,Highly recommend for anyone not wanting to have to pierce! Looks real and easy to use,5
16527,"These blades are, simply, great! The edge lasts through several shaves.  Best I've tried, to date.",5
16528,It does not work... I used this product for a month with any result,2
16529,broke when i took it out of the envelope it was sent in,1
16530,My wife loves this product. She says it works great!,5
16531,"Nice.  Not very noisy.
The design can be made better by placing the on-off switch at an easier place.
But not a big deal.",4
16532,Good blades and 100 will last me a long time.,4
16533,My wife wrote a review of this on her blog therealmoftherobinsons.com,4
16534,"This did not work at all for me, waste of money",1
16535,This thing is stupid. Athletic couple and we literally got nothing out if it. Maybe for heavier ppl?,1
16536,This is a very useful product I really enjoy it. It is a good size and the top cover is great to keep your monomer from evaporating.,5
16537,It really helps when you are trying to cover area's that are thinning.,4
16538,The power supply went out on me and never worked again.,1
16539,Looks good; razor holder side is a bit small many new type razors.,4
16540,I love Shea butter so this property was great I just wish it did not come in clumps of then that I liked it.,4
16541,"Good stuff. I don't rinse as recommended, and haven't experienced any problems because of that.",4
16542,"Lots of pigment. Apply lightly. Keeping the product,",3
16543,Love it. It massages the gums as well as gets the food out if the hardware. I would recommend it to anyone with braces,4
16544,Looks like the picture. Clips are rather difficult to open.,4
16545,It was just OK - not worth the price.  Nothing special.  I was disappointed in it.,2
16546,I payed for a manic panic amplified purple haze and got a $10.00 jar of regular purple haze.,1
16547,not totally satisfied...........did not fit my key,2
16548,still more expensive than a woman's version but a better bundle price online than a single at the store,4
16549,The bag had a heavy smell like paint thinner. It was so overbearing that I won't touch the brushes to my face.,1
16550,"Not scented like apricot, which I was hoping for. Not very great.",2
16551,Great lotion but the jar has come broken a few times.,4
16552,A little different than i expected but have worn it twice and is very versatile.,4
16553,"Worked as well as the name brand at a fraction of the price, but will not change life as we know it.",4
16554,Great color. Application is a little difficult because of lipstick shape but texture and wear is very good for price.,4
16555,BE CAREFUL! It leaves your hair looking greasy if you are not VERY careful using the tiniest bit!,2
16556,Exccellent company & supplement.  Myomin helps by getting rid of bad estrogen and keeping the good.  Especially good for menopause.,5
16557,"After a short time, the pause button started sticking in the paused position, making the unit useless.",1
16558,I love this product. It makes my face feel so refreshed. It's what I look forward to firt and last thing of everyday!,5
16559,To me this shampoo has to best smell. It cleans very well without drying my hair out. My favorite shampoo.,5
16560,Sent from overseas. Using one such previous order now. No complaints.,5
16561,"it is my first 4pcs, but I know that I love these brushes!",5
16562,"I have used this product for years and will continue to do so, if the product does not change it's formulation.  Thank you!",4
16563,"needed something to clean in-between my toes as I cannont rch my feet.  Works very well for this task, and it has an extra sponge tip.",4
16564,I keep reordering this - my husband has used this for decades and refuses to change....,5
16565,There is a problem with the power hook up on the machine it sparks and is turning the part you plug in black,4
16566,"When applied, Miracle Skin Transformer is silky smooth and the tint gives just the right amount of coverage for a totally natural appearance.",4
16567,i choose this rating because it is better than most of the same type of blade i bought in the store.,4
16568,"bought five pieces , the expiry date is only six months away which is too soon .... other wise its a great product",3
16569,YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR  . STARTED COMING APORT ON SIDES AFTER  TWO WASHING.,2
16570,"Tried for almost an hour and ended up tearing the plastic tube.
My wife will never ever buy this again.",1
16571,All three pair of clippers broke when I used them. They handled small cuts but any thick nail will snap these clippers! I am disappointed.,1
16572,This is my must have product.  It leaves my hair feeling great and makes it shine.  A great product for the hair.,5
16573,Didn't work as well as I thought it would.,3
16574,Love it.  Easy to use.  Will see what dentist says in 3 months.,5
16575,"A great invention, this is a wonderful product. I don't think husband could live without it now.  :-)",5
16576,Hose is hard plastic and breaks off after extended use.,3
16577,Use this every day and can not ask for more.  It is quiet compared to my old water pik.,5
16578,"Brought this for my  mom, She loves this oil.",5
16579,"I love the color and it smells really, really good. Unfortunately, mine broke as soon as I applied it, but I still use it.",4
16580,Liked the gloves but they are really big.  They would be better with a small amount of latex.,4
16581,"Worked really good, goes right where I wanted it to.",4
16582,Did not seem as effective as other Argan oils I have tried,2
16583,Not what I wanted.  I was more in the market for the strip used in a beauty salon not a barber salon,3
16584,the top part was cracked and the wax was really messy,2
16585,They are cute but not quite what I thought they would be like. Some are very large and not going to fit nails.,3
16586,"it came without instructions,but i will use it.it looks good,it came in a nice package.for the last words merry christmas.paul",4
16587,This is a really good trimmer. Easy to use and easy to clean. Just takesome minutes to trim and be on your way.,4
16588,DONT BUY ITS SMELL OLD AND POISON  WOULD NEVER BUY AGAIN !,1
16589,Did not receive the pink bag to keep the brushes in like the description said. But brushes are nice,1
16590,"Wish I had found you sooner, could not remember your name, and your blades were the best...will be ordering soon",5
16591,"This product is a scam. Please, please don't waste your money. Do your research.",1
16592,Love the hat and so did my girlfriend who I also bout the same hat for. Better than I expected!,5
16593,I received the product and it wouldn't stick to my shower tile and just fell off.  It was a waste of money.,1
16594,I got this for my boyfriend as a gag gift that then became a present for me.,4
16595,"The dental cleaner works great. It cleans and you can feel the diifference when you insert retainers back into your mouth, after cleaning.

Good product!",4
16596,"Smell is disgusting! Picture was deceiving, and they would not return it.",1
16597,A great vibrant color that comes off on other things but stays on your lips and took quite a while to scrub off.,4
16598,"Very pleasant smell, not at all that strong nasty alcohol smell.",5
16599,"met expectation for an electric razor. Does not shave close, like a 3 or 4 blade razor and soap. It will do.",3
16600,The tip fell off after 1 use. Brush soft and hair gets tangled.,2
16601,"Warning; Contains Lead, a cancer causing substance. I return it after reading the label.",1
16602,First blade I tried as a beginner and was very pleased with results. No nicks or cuts and provided a very smooth shave.,5
16603,"for the price is good.. a little goes a long way, too much and you look like miss piggy",3
16604,Works ad advertised. I am very satisfied with it.,4
16605,This product smells so awful even after you take a shower. Worst lotion that I have ever tried. I regret buying it!,1
16606,I only received 1 pack of floss not the six listed.  In the past I've received a multi pack or 6 in a bag.,1
16607,I was completely disappointed because what arrived was not DUO.  It was Ardell.,1
16608,"These are better than the last ones from China, but still not as sturdy as the ones my salon uses. Good value, though.",4
16609,Covers pretty well for spot treatment. Doesnt break me out.,4
16610,Great gift idea for the women in your life....,5
16611,They are OK. I think they are a lil bit to small for 3D nail art. Maybe I should of went something bigger than 2mm.,3
16612,Pretty sturdy. Helps out in the tiny bathroom hugely but it wobbles on tile a little. The design is lovely though!,4
16613,Took about a year to get here... Don't like the brushes.,2
16614,"Does what it says. A little pricey for the life of the pad, still is the best out there",4
16615,I like this nail polish thinner.  Only have to use very little to thin out the nail polisher.,4
16616,Seems to be reducing a few of my wrinkles. I'll keep using it and report my progress.,4
16617,"As I suspected, it's messy and that is the reason I don't like it. Consider it a personal reason. It is powerful.",1
16618,They were way smaller than expected. They also don't enhance anything.!,1
16619,"Works ok, but the attachments are quite fragile. I've broken most of the beard trimming attachments that I bring when traveling.",4
16620,Bristles are a little harder than expected.  My daughter tried it and it hurt her sensitive skin.  I use it but try to scrub very lightly.,3
16621,Falls apart fast. You get what you pay for at this price. Would not purchase ever ever again.,2
16622,"The pump is horrible, the gel leaves your skin shiny, and it is ineffective.",1
16623,"Really nice headband, fits well and has the perfect casual look.  It did not hurt my head, which is always a plus.",5
16624,"This product provides a close trim and shapes up the bikini area nicely. If you are anti apilator and waxing, this trimmer is worth the purchase.",4
16625,"Like the idea of using old formula shampoo, in bar form.  Simple ingredients that for the most part I can understand",4
16626,"I bought 100.  I used 100.  I was happy to move to a better, slightly more expensive brand.",3
16627,"You get what you pay for, it is ok. Not as shiny as in the picture.",3
16628,Nice piece for the price doesnt look too cheap or anything,4
16629,"Bought this for my girlfriend.
Not surgical steel. The bar turned green and  her ear became infected.",2
16630,nice colors but best to give as a gift to a kid. The pots are very small,4
16631,It should have the names of the brushes on the end of them. It'd be really helpful. And the hairs fall out.,2
16632,I was expecting a good ones!! They fall apart and they aren't soft enough to be used on the eyes. Im dissapointed,1
16633,"Works, but MUCH noisier than the last one I had.  Sounds like a machine gun.",2
16634,"I just started using it as suggested by a friend, love Rosewater and this brand works well for me.",4
16635,My daughter has curly hair and uses it every time after shower.,4
16636,Wonderful. Wish they would bring back the baby wash in rice milk and mallow as well!,5
16637,great scent!!  terrible lasting powe.  Gone in  an hour.,3
16638,Quite a few of the 'pods' were empty and missing capsules.,1
16639,Work just ok for my daughter's lip when she have dry lip.,4
16640,This Philips Norelco stands the age of time. I've been using it for years and it always gets the job done.,4
16641,"It really makes my eyelashes look longer especially combined with my normal mascara. However, I still haven't seen results stated in the package",3
16642,Was told about this product by my sister and it did help the wound heal rather quickly.  Worked great,4
16643,"Made in China, not USA as stated in description. I would not give these to my child, and had to discard them.",1
16644,I wish I had read the ingredient list before I bought this shampoo. The second ingredient is sodium laureth sulfate.,2
16645,a little smaller than I thought but it works like it should and looks like the photo.,4
16646,This kit was just ok. My face felt cleaner however I did not notice a change in my complexion after using all the products as directed.,3
16647,1/3 to half my cones would not stay lit. This is the second time too.,2
16648,It took a long time to received the product. I liked it though. Thank u,3
16649,Love this backpack it's super cute. It's perfect for daughter now that we don't use a diaper bag any more.,5
16650,Have only used several times and I am not sure what I think of them as I have not seen a difference.,3
16651,"It was as advertised, and a good price as far as I can find.",4
16652,I love this product I got it two days after ordering and I've already put it to work...I'm very satisfied w my results,5
16653,Provides a strong scent of sandalwood.  Maybe too strong.,3
16654,"Nice matte color, its pinkier-red not a true cherry red but i still love it. Needs to be applied alot though.",4
16655,Zipper broke on bag first time sipping it. Bag is useless. The stuff is ok I guess.,1
16656,I have not noticed any change and I used it every day.  Very disappointed.,2
16657,"This serum feels so wonderful on my skin, it goes on smoothly and is absorbed well. It leaves my skin feeling so soft and hydrated.",5
16658,size too big and it doesn't have any other available size.,1
16659,My items came in a little broken.  There was loose powder all over. Not too happy with this purchase.  Prior purchase came in perfect.,2
16660,A couple of the stones were missin . It was a little smaller then expecte . But they stay in nicely and look cute.,3
16661,"Does the job, but feels like I have dirty hair.. this or 'grey away' product.. grey away is cheaper though and does the same thing",4
16662,I really like this product except wish the part that goes around the hair was larger.,4
16663,"I bought this a year through QVC and loved it. Now, it doesn't feel the same. Very chalky. Disappointed.",2
16664,"Shaver works better when I clean it regularly with this product.  Smoother shaves, quieter.",4
16665,No quite what I was looking for but I still like them,4
16666,"Gives a decent shave. Not as good as the disposable brands, but good enough.",4
16667,"Very messy to use, but it gets the job done. Just have a towel close by. Thank you very much.",4
16668,This  should be called a body spray not a perfume. It stinks! yek! and i will not recommend this to anyone,1
16669,It's ok. I've been using it for a few months now and it's starting to fray already but still does the job.,3
16670,Great stand for my razor and brush.  Greatly priced too!  Delivery was fast.  Great product.  Very satisfied.,5
16671,i love this item. i love all the multi-brushes with individual plastic covering and their own pouch to be in.,4
16672,Pretty hairy guy myself. Product works as advertised and leaves me with a nice smooth chest.,4
16673,Great comb! Very well made and the wood even has a nice scent. Pairs well with Northern Fir's beard oil!,5
16674,"The picture showed something A LOT BIGGER the actual size barely fits a wallet, super poor quality materials, smells very ""rubbery"" sad!",1
16675,"Covers well, I like the darker color than my hair. It can get sticky. But, not as bad as other products!",4
16676,This red clay is one of the best and the price is amazing I have been a repeat buyer for over a year now improve skins texture and tightness,5
16677,I do not like it and would like to return it!! How does one do that???,1
16678,Really do use it between getting roots colored.  Wish it was cheaper.  Perhaps if they offered a package of three and more color choices.,4
16679,It works!  I was pretty skeptical but wanted to stretch out the time between colorings.  I have thick hair so maybe that helps.,4
16680,This oil is very sticky to me.  I just use it as a pre-poo over night,3
16681,"Super long, very dramatic (will touch your eyelashes)!!",4
16682,Product was okay. However the packing of the product was poorly done. The bottle opened inside the box.,4
16683,"Very elegant looking, serves its purpose with a great look",4
16684,I think they sent a mid labelled product. The fragrance was always one of my favourites. This bore no resemblance to it at all.,1
16685,"Love the product! Wish the hoses lasted longer before breaking, but at least they can be easily replaced.",4
16686,I think it's good.. Not really sure if I've seen results.,4
16687,"Very low quality plastic. Slow to heat, but does work to curl hair. Not sure what will happen the first time it falls.",3
16688,"I feel the first application normal, but in the third week you feel changes normal, I change for a one better",3
16689,Great summer lotion as it's light and smells fresh!,4
16690,WORKS GOOD BUT I DON'T CARE FOR THE SCENT.,3
16691,The material wasn't what I wanted. Rubberized plastic.,2
16692,Didn't last five months. But it worked correctly before that.,1
16693,"Revived very quickly , the pearls are very very tiny.",3
16694,It smells like avacados and old baby oil. Definitely not Nag Champa.,2
16695,"Received only one after a month, where is the other one?",1
16696,I used this for everything and for the most part it has given me any trouble.,4
16697,"The base is large and weighs the right amount so it does not fall over, nicely crafted",5
16698,Only ine and lost that one.  Too expensive for only one.  Usually a dollar every where else.,1
16699,I really like these and they are pretty decent quality. Thumbs up!,5
16700,"Didn't like it, the chemical make up didn't agree with my system. I brought two tubes, I need know how to return y",1
16701,Had no key to lock . Compartment deviders are to small for usual make up compacts.,1
16702,I like it I really feel my eyes look wake after using it,4
16703,THIS GLOVES ARE PERFECT FOR MY OUTFIT THAT I'M GOING TO USE IN A 1950 PARTY.  THEY ARE PERFECT.  BEST REGARDS.,5
16704,It would of got more stars if I was even Abel to use it. It was stolen from my door,1
16705,Wife loves it. Im sure she'll force me to order anotger set.,5
16706,"Cheaply made and barely functional. I tried to use while using LED skin care device near my eyes.

They are worth $1.00 if that.",2
16707,This is the only place I could find replacement heads for my husb,5
16708,"Too bad this one has been discontinued (the body spray anyhow) because it smells great, according to the girls that is!",5
16709,Great product and covers new growth in between visits to salon.,4
16710,Product works as expected. It washes out very easily. Only issue is that it is difficult to know when the can is close to empty.,4
16711,will not work on car keys. they are to thick. works on door key thickness only. add should point that out,1
16712,If  you want to waiste your money buy this item. doesnt work.  The wraps are to lose don't tie up & the wrapping lotion doesnt work,1
16713,It has a great price and fits my ipod touch very well. Havent had any problems  in the last month that I have been using it.,4
16714,Used ito n my daughter for nearly two years. Great product with proven ingredients and nice scent.,5
16715,"These are good for beginners to start with but had a tendency to tug more than feathers do, but do get the job done.",3
16716,I just got the item and it is empty! What a scam!,1
16717,"These gloves are beautiful and very well made.  If you are looking for gloves of this type, you will not be disappointed.",5
16718,"used it once, way too loose, king of waste of money. I have used products from brazil and this was a joke",2
16719,Good and quick delivery. Item as described. Will buy from this seller again.,5
16720,"Liquid latex, for all those moments when you need to let your inner zombie rot on the outside some.",5
16721,"it was very thick and hard to tame, differing from the picture in many ways",2
16722,"the rhinestones are nice, but the hard plastic case came shattered and i had to sort through all the tiny rhinestones.",3
16723,glad to get replacement sometimes hard to find when you need them.  just what we needed to replace the lamp,4
16724,"This product does just what it suppose 2, I will recommend this to my friends. My results is amazing. ",4
16725,The tape was O.K. But too expensive! I paid much less but the manufacture doesn't make it anymore,3
16726,Product was shipped/received without a spray nozzle or cap. I needed to transfer the oil into a different container for use. Oil itself is wonderful.,1
16727,Super cheap version of shower gloves. Get the ones at Bed Bath & Beyond for $3.99 instead - they are thicker and feel much better!,1
16728,This is a great product.  The attachments are a little fragile but in general it is much better than the Wahl.,5
16729,Works as advertised.  My dentist and I have noticed an inprovement in teeth and gums.,4
16730,"These blades are absolutely terrible.  They are not sharp; as such, will cause nicks and cuts.  Go with Feathers.",1
16731,"It's not really a tape, just a wide string.",2
16732,This is a good clipper.  So far it's been good for trimming between haircuts.  The attachments work as well.,4
16733,These are OK. They're about what you'd expect for a disposable triple blade razor.,3
16734,"i absolutely love them, they came in just in time too. Extremely soft and I'm happy I bought it",5
16735,This bottle is huge. It will most likely last me forever. I do really enjoy it.,4
16736,"It works ok initially.. However, the items in the head is too easy to be un-assembled and it is hard to assemble it back nicely..",3
16737,Don't believe the product makes a difference.  I waitress at a gentleman's club and it's useless.,3
16738,Not anywhere near 3000 gems. I expected the little boxes to be filled but no. DO NOT be fooled by the picture.,1
16739,Stuff is fake it's supose to burn left if on my face for 30 min nothing happend,1
16740,Got to use on scars from surgery and it helps keep them soft works good Doctor told me to use and know I use all the time would recommend,5
16741,"The prodect does not shave good. And it causes bumps ,It just no good...i wish i could return this prodect.",2
16742,Definitely are being returned as they are not Gene Bras.....no zipper and run small.,2
16743,"A little too rough and stiff for my tastes. Some might appreciate it, but I was expecting different.",3
16744,This is the worst shaver EVER. Can only cut peach fuzz and cleaning the thing is a nightmare. Who ever designed this thing should be fired,1
16745,Item was received as described. It's a good stand for its purpose.,4
16746,"This is a great razor at the $18-20 price point I regularly see it at, but $46.95 is taking advantage of customers.",2
16747,This works very well on my daughters naturally thick and curly hair. I just wish it had healthier ingredients and a better price.,4
16748,"This product is great for very fine, short hair, which is what I have.  I highly recommend this.",5
16749,"Easy to use, doesnt shred like some floss. Ideal for implants",5
16750,"Package was destroyed upon arrival, samples were so small, - not worth it!",1
16751,"Too much work for me though. But otherwise they look great, and worked great. After about two weeks i gave up",5
16752,"SO happy to have finally find this product, tried others but they just weren't right.  - Keeps everything neat and trims extremely close!",5
16753,our daughter complains anytime we brush but she complains less when we use this. The fragrance is sugary which works well for younger kids.,3
16754,"Bought the wrong fragrance, that's my fault, but still like the product and quality.  Don't like this fragrance though",4
16755,This was a gift for my husband. He said it works as well on the job as he expected it to do.,4
16756,This is not what seems to be extra coarse as the darker blue that came with the micro pedi roller originally.,3
16757,"It is good for protecting my scalp, like it should, I tried other brands but I like this one better.",4
16758,Product is okay.  One doesn't like to have to wear something like this but it does help.,3
16759,"Taste isn't good, but works wonders for your teeth. I would suggest doing this along with regular brushing, though.",4
16760,This really cleans. It has not strong scent. It corrals the wiping residue and freshens.,4
16761,Wish I could give half a star burned my skin. And has what looks like shards of charcoal or something very abrasive for my skin,1
16762,This product was for black hair. Way to dark for my medium to dark brown hair.,1
16763,This is not the orchard lotion not sure what is in the bottle.  Cheap smell and wrong color bub.,1
16764,I spray this on the vents of our A/Cs to keep the oil aerated throughout the bedrooms - we love it in our house and use it daily!,5
16765,"I haven't tried a more expensive razor, but this one does a great job at a great price.  My last Norelco lasted 20 years.",5
16766,The cape is thin and tears easily.  I have only use it about five times and it already has a few rips in it.  Very disappointing.,1
16767,came broken off. color was not what i expected.,2
16768,the hair tends to slip off the side when I'm trying to roll it. not as easy as I thought it will work :(,1
16769,Appears to have been on a shelf for a long time.,2
16770,"These gloves are gorgeous, ribbon tie in back helps the fit to be just right.  Will wear at my wedding.",5
16771,"I think this works great, good pressure. I just wish i didn't have to fill the water tank so often.",4
16772,It's okay. No the results I had seen in reviews for though. Fast shipping!!!,3
16773,"Exactly what I wanted!  Great blades, great price!",5
16774,A lots of broken wax and hard to melt with water.,1
16775,These heads were easy to install and work great  for Dad. He thinks he has a new shaver and is thrilled with them.,5
16776,As long as you don't expect any use out of the shaver this is a great product.,4
16777,"Fake. absolute The taste is not right, apply to the face also did not have before that kind of slight tingling feeling.",1
16778,It sucked it doesn't even look good. It looks all retarded on the ear.,1
16779,I expected it to be very dark red as Mac dive dupe but it is not dark as diva but anyway I like it very beautiful and sexy color,4
16780,"Please note, they don't have the same cap shows in picture, the cap is smaller and covers the Central area where foam comes out",3
16781,I have found I like creams better than soaps.  You may want to try Cremo Cream.,2
16782,"Have to take 2 in the morning and 2 at night, otherwise would have given 5. My hair start to grow faster",4
16783,pretty much what I expected. a little difficult to open.,5
16784,Smells great and gets rid of chlorine itch like a boss,5
16785,"very bulky, need a lot of space in bathroom. how do you spit if water comes continuously in your mouth",1
16786,awesome scent had to order online as everyone seems to be out of it.  would recommend highly if you like fresh smells,5
16787,My cracks crevices and such have never been so shiny in places the sun don't shine.,5
16788,"It's much smaller than I expected, but still useful.",3
16789,"I like how it works on my haur, have it looking great.",5
16790,wonderful!  i am so pleased.  much better than cornstarch or baking soda alone.  scent is very light and pleasing.,5
16791,This really works to prevent wrinkles while sleeping!  This is the 3rd one I have purchased.  I keep one just for traveling.,5
16792,works well if you don't mind greasy hands that won't easily wash off.,2
16793,The container came cracked and the product is partially dry.,3
16794,Smells great and helps keep my super sensitive face from breaking out at every tiny slight it feels it must endure. :),4
16795,I love this shirt. Flattering and easy to wear. Feels great on the skin.,5
16796,It makes my legs smooth and shaving rash free! It does everything is promises. i would and have recommended this product to friends.,5
16797,"After discovering such thing/device I decided to give it a try, it is awesome , effortless way to floss, I use it every night",5
16798,"I like the formula, but I got it in tea rose and it was a little  more purple than what i would've liked",3
16799,"OK.  The handle is too short for a guy 6'1"".",3
16800,I do not like this product it is not convenient.,1
16801,"It's works well, but it's a little bit salty",4
16802,Some what moisturizing.  Overall a disappointment for the money.,1
16803,This really does what it says it will do.  Results are most evident after 4-6 weeks of use.  I am now on my 3rd bottle!,5
16804,"Just what I needed as original blades became dull.  Sharp blades = clean shave, no pulling on beard while shaving.",4
16805,very cheap but i guess you get what you pay for,1
16806,"Over the long run the device should help people with gengivitis. It is easy to use and, so far, it has been sturdy.",4
16807,DIDN'T STAY ON THERE NOT EVEN STRONG ENOUGH TO HOLD THE PIERCING ON YOUR NOSE! VERY UNHAPPY!!,1
16808,"Smells great and really does its job! The brush in the one I ordered came a little bent, but it's manageable.",5
16809,It didn't stand up very well against the body-odor of a very active 9 year old.,3
16810,This wooden holder is smaller than how it looks in the picture. It is good to hold small sized books.,3
16811,My wife likes it. She had one before the finally had a problem.,4
16812,Would not use any other conditioner.  I use it at least every 2 weeks to keep my white hair shining and healthy!,5
16813,I have a good razer this was great! Glad I didn't have to pay $100.00 for this.,4
16814,did absolutely nothing to increase volume- even paired with Pure Abundance Shampoo which I do love.  Very disappointed!,1
16815,Kit was nice came with everything you needed I used a different belly ring thought that one was small,5
16816,Works just as well as pfb with chromabright but costs less,4
16817,I'm allergic to something in lotion; my face turned red in spots and swelled up.,1
16818,"can be a bit messy (water splashing all over the place even when on the lowest power), but still very good!",4
16819,Disgusting.  Doesn't work. Leaks.  Have to reapply daily.,1
16820,"Good product, and I got the best price from Amazon by at least $10.00. Product would be great if it was not so messy.",4
16821,After few day of use the brush is not charging and it doesn't work. Very expensive product to have so poor performance.,1
16822,"The item is fine, my husband did not adapt well to using it.  One of my kids is using it with great success.",3
16823,This bottle is huge. It will most likely last me forever. I do really enjoy it.,4
16824,Anyone who has a dental bridge needs these. The 4-pack here is a better buy than at the drug store.,5
16825,Love this shampoo. Was looking for something more natural and with less chemicals - this filled the bill. Will purchase again!,5
16826,Does the job - doesn't seem to be in the stores anymore.,4
16827,"Good product for the price, would recommend. I have been using now for several months and has help up rather well.",4
16828,It is a little noisy but I heard all water like are noisy.,4
16829,I like the consistency of this lipstick.  My only negative is that the color is a little brighter red than I anticipated.,4
16830,Once the pink is under the UV lights they are too bright like you're looking at the sun.,1
16831,Was shocked at the difference so quickly. I have fine hair and got body and texture I didn't know existed,4
16832,"It might work better for a boy but for my girl it did not hold her.

Thanks though!",3
16833,"These are cute, functional, pretty and stylish. I gave these to my friends for valentines day and they loved them.",4
16834,"Great colors, and the only all matte shadow collection with useful colors that I have found. Compact enough for travel",4
16835,"These tiny but, that's what I like if your Elbert is gaged these probably won't work for you but, for me the are great!",5
16836,"The best cure for a husband with garlic ""issues"" Works really well. easy. fresh.  and seems healthy enough.  good product",4
16837,"Pretty, love the color stays on longer then you would think!",4
16838,"Awesome product super fast shipping even came sooner than estimated arrival date A+++++
Michele Dressler",5
16839,I bought these but I ended up not using them because my hair is thin and it is so hard to hide them.  =(,1
16840,Size was perfect they do get dirty fast if you spill any greasey liquids on it but it can be washed,3
16841,I was disappointed since the bottom of the bottle was broken when the package arrived today. I wish I could receive a replacement of this product.,1
16842,"The toothbrush head seem a little hard to fit at first, but I pushed down a little harder and it snapped into place.",4
16843,I only shave my mustache daily so this is perfect for light shaving and very easy to travel with especially with the rubber interior case,4
16844,this product is ok - tons smaller than it looks in the picture - very tiny - but ok - thanks,2
16845,I love these they are super soft and stay clean with the poach. None of the hair has come out and they are easy too clean.,5
16846,"It smells great but it is too thin. We are using it up far faster than we did another brand, which unfortunately only comes in peppermint.",3
16847,"Great looks, fair capacity, a bit expensive. Overall pretty good!",4
16848,"This has become my go to styling paste.  You only need a little, and it works like bed-head.  Very happy with my purchase.",5
16849,Works great on small cuts and razor burn. I really like this product.,5
16850,Too soon to tell if the product works but the packaging was terrible. It spilled.,2
16851,"This has a very pleasant taste, minty but not too over powering. I like this better than chewing gum or using mints to freshen my breath.",4
16852,Mildy Disappointing. Does not have the sharp razor edge as advertized.,3
16853,Considering the good quality and amount for the price it's a very good deal. I get a weeks worth of shaves per blade.,4
16854,"As some people have described, these are large eye patches ((not smaller)).  But since I must have them I will keep them.",3
16855,A little lighter than expected but feels good on lips.,3
16856,they were to long was hoping they were smaller in length,2
16857,The smoothness and glow in my skin really came out. Love this product.,4
16858,Color was a little brighter than the picture. Not too worried because the price was spot on.,4
16859,Not the best product. Why aren't there more competive products like this that don't contain hazardous chemicals??,2
16860,A comb shaped like a gun ? Seriously ???????,1
16861,Love my pure instinct. It gives off the perfect amount of pheromones to complimenting any perfume or body wash I'm already wearing,5
16862,"I like this product, because it leaves your hair looking natural, and its not damaging your hair.",4
16863,These are great! And the stones do not fall out. They are easy to put in and the backs are disguised very well.,5
16864,These really didn't work for the person I gave them to.  They still had bad breath.,2
16865,This is glue is hard to come by considering a lot of women is wearing lace frontal wigs and weaves,4

16869,Works as promised. But why do these have to be so expensive?,4
16870,I really think these help but hard to get used to wearing - I'm trying to be more regular with wearing them each night!!,4
16871,Love the color and application just a bit sticky. Nothing too bad for the price.,5
16872,My daughter loves them & she put them in as soon they arrived. Highly recommended.,5
16873,Does not hold razor effectively... slips off.  Does hold brush well.,2
16874,Although I think it wouldn't hurt if it was a bit cheaper this product is a very great way to style and trim of course.,5
16875,Feel good and relaxing on but haven't really seen any changes or improvements.  But they feel good while on :),3
16876,Kids love them. Still trying to get them to use them right but they love the shapes and it's a good way to get them flossing.,5
16877,Works ad advertised. I am very satisfied with it.,4
16878,Wore it for a flapper themed bridal shower and got many compliments! Great quality!,5
16879,So far so good.  Started using the product and will verify results at a later date.,3

16882,Love this matte color! I blend it with a darker lip liner and it looks awesome,5
16883,The serum in the pump is better than this cream. The cream is less effective for some reason.,2
16884,"a real waste . I have spent my money on this useless thing . In the first use , the appliance burned .",1
16885,soft soap doesn't last as long as some but it's still nice,5
16886,"very happy, got the product in about 4-5 days and does wonders organizing my 4 yr. olds toys in the bath tub.",4

16889,"Take my word for it:

DO NOT MOTORBOAT these breasts!

I repeat:

DO NOT MOTORBOAT these breasts!

You have been warned!",5
16890,I'm thinking of manufacturing a competitor for this product with a far more imaginative name:  MINGE TINGE! or BLIFF LIFT!,5
16891,These are good eye shields and for the price you cant beat them.,4
16892,"very happy, got the product in about 4-5 days and does wonders organizing my 4 yr. olds toys in the bath tub.",4
16893,"SUPERB product here. The problem I encountered is after 8 months the waterpik refuses to start. Nothing has changed either.

Therefore...3 stars.",3
16894,"wow, my wife and my dad like it. It helps heal the skins dramatically.",5
16895,I love the color and that is a full set but one of the brushes broke before I even used them and others a loose,1
16896,"It did help our gums, but the water pressure became funny then the machine completely stopped working after only 1.5 years of use.",2
16897,"The bristles are a bit limp, but it gets the job done.",3
16898,"I have tried other root sprays, and this one seems to work better than L'Oreal and Everpro (which has less ounces too).",5
16899,Need to apply a lot to get the effect that I want,3
16900,Haven't seen significant results but defiantly love the smell and how soft my hair feel,4
16901,Wonderful hair styler for my fine hair.  I have them in 2 sizes.,5
16902,Great balance of Sharpness and smoothness in a double edged blade.,4
16903,"What can I add after all the good reviews about nars blush orgasm? Nothing really, all has been previously said.",4
16904,I've owned this for two months. Used it twice and now it doesn't work.,1
16905,it developed a pin hole in the hose after less than a year in use - Waterpik needs to address this problem,3
16906,do not see any difference after applying it for few days...,3
16907,Too rough.  I might try the extra-soft next time if they have it.,2
16908,Won't buy this again very little product for big money.,1
16909,"I wouldn't consider it really working, I don't think anyone even noticed I had it on.",3
16910,The color is beautiful just perfect and i really enjoyed the free samples that came with it.,5
16911,I had an older model and could not find replacement heads.  This runs much quieter than my old one and does a great job,5
16912,I like this tool and look forward to using it more often when needed.,4
16913,"it was not as shown in pic , it didn't have the tail im dissatisfied",2
16914,My hair is growing back thicker and faster!  I take it everyday!,5
16915,"It actually works.  I do agree that you can't hold it upside down to spray, so it does take some practice.  LOL",4
16916,I really like...but to small for my shaving brush,4
16917,"I like the battery powered flosser better but it doesn't last that long.
I would also like stronger water pressure.",4
16918,This is an excellent cream for older women with aging skin.  Blends into the skin at night easily.  It was recommended to me by my dermatologist.,5
16919,still slips around but it is really nice and soft!,2
16920,No seal on bottle. Extremely runny. Like water. Seams tampered with.,1
16921,"I thought this was an exfoliating mitt and it wasn't.  Waste of money for me, and not worth the time to return.",2
16922,"These blades are very sharp.
They either dull or the edges fold almost immediately after one use.",3
16923,"Nice, but it is too small to hold the ""Prince"" brush by the handle.  You have to slide it in at the bristles.",3
16924,The product works as described.  Only used the regular water pik attachement. Never used the other ones before.  The water container is a bit small.,4
16925,"THE MATERIAL IS CHEAP AND ITS CHEAP LOOKING . NOT WHAT I EXPECTED AT ALL AND THE GLITTER GETS ALLOVER HAIR, FACE AND ON CLOTHING.",2
16926,Perfect for a which fix between colorings.  My roots grow fast so I use this a lot on my greys.,4
16927,Great dental reports for many years after purchase.  Original lasted about five years of daily use even travel on vacation.  No complaints at all.,4
16928,Super thin and prone to ripping but cheap and does the job.,3
16929,The colors are nice but the pieces are all wonky shaped. Terrible if you're trying to do glitter placement.,3
16930,Wish the cocoa butter actually fit in the tube. It's loose.,3
16931,The blades get dull after only 1 use.  Are unusable after 2 or 3.,1
16932,"These get too hot, dangerously so.easy to use but watch out as they heat up fast. More plastic bags should have been included.",2
16933,The bump didn't work to bulky I do better jod with the com,1
16934,I love this product so much bought for my Mother for Christmas and she loves it..........,5
16935,Did not do a thing. Was a waste of my money. Would not recommend to anyone at all. Should be taken off of site.,1
16936,I really liked the functionality.  It did a nice job.  But the Accu-Vac came apart after a couple of months.,1
16937,"its okay for the price, It can be a nice gift or take your trip",3
16938,I have a hard time keeping the straps together with this. I am pretty busty though and wanted something to help lift.,3
16939,My daughter love the color and wear them everyday for school.,5
16940,For me I thinks it's worth the money nice after a shave to heel any nicks and gives u feed back for where u did nick yourself.,5
16941,"Blocks light well, but fabric dye stained my pillows and left residue on my face.",1
16942,"does a great job gets into all the spots in between teeth, it  is does get the sink area a little messy though from the spray",4
16943,I like thin washcloths...these are so thin that I don't understand how they don't disintegrate,2
16944,Impressed by the smoothness and glide. I will buy again,4
16945,"I really liked this product, but after a year the water tube broke off and cannot be replaced.  The machine is now useless.",2
16946,Great Shaver. . wish surface area was greater. . . i find the cleaning very easy. . holds charge pretty well.,4
16947,I love this spray makes it easy to clean brushes in between applications.,5
16948,"Great product, and easy to use between salon visits.",4
16949,Given as a Gift. Well liked once they started using it. Good Price as well.,3
16950,This product works very well & was shipped & delivered early. Thanks,4
16951,"This is the easiest floss threader I have ever used, far and away, but a bit pricey on Amazon.",4
16952,Somehow they forgot to mention that these are FROSTY. All three shades are. I assumed they would be matte and I don't do frosty!,1
16953,The tips are the worst thing ever!! Super cheap! The brush works if you take care of it. Okay for beginners.,4
16954,"They were great for a bit, kind of uncomfortable. They broke after a month.",3
16955,I really like this emulsifying wax. It's easy to use and did a great job blending my oils.,5
16956,Great affordable blades. Never going back to disposable razors.,4
16957,"They feel really flimsy but hard in the wrong places. Bought these for work for the estheticians, but they probably won't use them.",2
16958,"Works well to temporarily smooth away those vertical cleavage lines.  Wear it for an hour, and it lasts for 1-2hrs.",4
16959,I expected 5 Replacement heads because 1 was $29 and I paid $82 expecting 5.  Misleading marketing!,2
16960,It falls apart easily didn't like it. Stic with the real good ones,3
16961,Simple and sturdy. That's all you need in a stand. It looks great too.,5
16962,The case was way too loose. Does not stay on. If it fit right it would be an ok case.,1
16963,Got it today and i love had to dip it in some salt water because im swollen but its gorgeous,4
16964,I gave these away as gifts. They look the same in person. They have a small mirror inside.,4
16965,It was not what I wanted or ordered at all. In three days of wearing it my fingers tuned colors.,1
16966,"lovely... great product... goes well with the lotion too!  Everyone smiles at me and says""  you smell so good""...",5
16967,I love this.  I really wish I had gotten one sooner.,4
16968,Really loved the way it made my skin feel. Would definitely purchase it again. I would like to try some of the other products.,5
16969,"Icky stuff, wish I had known that it wasn't a cream. It's just a high priced Vaseline.",1
16970,This works great and I keep one on all levels of my house!,4
16971,Not worth the money it costs. Similar and cheaper products will work just as well,2
16972,Doesn't give a good lather but it moisturizes the skin really well and has a great scent.,4
16973,"I love it my girl frnd bought for me and she massaged me, with specially if your cold and can warming up",4
16974,"This is a great help for fine hair, I've used it for three years and it really makes a difference !",5
16975,Just what I was looking for. The rings are a little big but it's just so that it can fit a range of finger sizes.,4
16976,"Extremely large avd chain too short, it's a cool design but plan on invorporating to art piece",4
16977,Does not grip the hair.  The hair slide as you clip.,2
16978,The Product is excellent but the smell and taste of plastic is offensive to me. Is there a way to rid it of that odor?,4
16979,"It did nothing for my rosacea , however it's a good moisturizer.",2
16980,Is good just to put in garbage. Trust me don't buy it,1

16982,hair turned green. eww. desroyed my hair trying to fix it. never again.,2

16984,They are awful  n i unfortunately  bought the 3 pack for $21.00  don't waste your money  on this trash product,1
16985,"A little bit to hard to wash away, but cleans great",4
16986,"I'm still playing around with this product, to be fair, but so far I'm not exactly ""wowed"" by its results.",3
16987,Very cute!  But a little strong for my 7 yr old,4
16988,"Don't use this to shave your sack. Gadzooks, there was more blood and screaming than a midnight screening of The Shining.",3
16989,"Good as trimmer, not intended to be used as a shaver.

Good overall value.",4
16990,Very nice quality and matches perfectly with my Merkur 34C razor.,5
16991,It's not as dark as I like it to be but it is pigmented,4
16992,"I find this deodorant cool in odour and very effective and long lasting ,

C'est vident pour utilise cette dodorant .
Merci",4
16993,"Not found often elsewhere, such as Sephora and other similar stores.
It's not cheap but it lasts for a long long time.",5
16994,"Awful, got stuck in my hair. Took my 45 min. to get it out :(",1
16995,It's still going after two years.  The holder broke but the rest works!,4
16996,This is exactly what I expected. I bought a couple to use as stocking stuffers and it worked just like I had hoped.,5
16997,It seems like just water. Wasted alot of money.,1
16998,Button came off 1st day...nice bag but in need of better tailoring,3
16999,I split these between my two young granddaughters in their stockings and they are crazy about them.,4
17000,Got this for my cousin's Xmas gift. Has nice fragrance and the set was beautifully wrapped.,4

17002,Granddaughter likes it but wishes it was a bit longer to accommodate her brushes,4
17003,Works very well but a bit expensive and leaves the brown color on the pillow cases,4
17004,"Very good for this price
But it looks a little big...
Anyway, I like it",4
17005,"It gives  my baby fine, flat hair body when I have the cut just right. Its worth it. Glad I tried it.",3
17006,Makes the whole bathroom and surrounding rooms smell so good.  Doesn't smell the same on your skin after use though.,5
17007,This is not makeup! weird  that my review options were about makeup. It is an HGH product and it is fine!,4
17008,"Love this lotion!  So rich and creamy.  Smells great, too.  On my second bottle.  Would definitely recommend it and continue to buy it.",4
17009,Bottle came empty with no liquid. Bad packing procedures.,2
17010,My product came on time! Long lasting. Little expensive but well worth the money! Very pretty shade.. goes well with baked oatmeal shadow too!,5
17011,"This is the same unit I had for years, but this one is very noisy. Need to replace it for a quiet one.",2
17012,"Works great, exactly like the more expensive prime version, if you don't mind waiting a bit longer for the shipping.",5
17013,It is very expensive and it does not work!!!.  I have lost my money.,1
17014,Reasonably priced.  Decent quality for the price.  Covers shoulders well.  Meets expectations.,5
17015,Doesn't work for my husband's big wrists.  Okay for me.  The case is cheapo.,3
17016,A rechargeable razor is very convient.  A razor that will not hold a charge for a shave is a frustraction.,2
17017,Maybe not the fault of the dish but it wasn't quite big enough for my shaving soap to fit inside.,3
17018,"GOOD COMB. TERRIBLE COLOR BUT GOOD USE, THE SPACE BETWEEN NEEDLES IS KINDA FAR BUT WORK WELL FOR ME!",4
17019,Too stiff if you try to sleep on your side.,3
17020,Makes your hair feel awful and very dangled and dry!,1
17021,I had a allergic reaction to these they worked for my 30min MRI but not for long term use I'll probably just throw them out,2
17022,"I have tried many trimmers during years, these two are the best I have had so far. They look and feel professional.",5
17023,Quality is excellent.  The only drawback was it did not include a holder or rack for the razor and attachments.,4
17024,"Not real, this is mini. Just spend the $2 dollars and buy it from Sephora",1
17025,Absorbs easily and is none greasy. Smells a bit like hazlenuts.,4
17026,hahahah  its nice and intimidating to the opponents they think we are tattoo. lover.,5
17027,Fast shipping. Affordable price. Would recommend seller. Item as described. The paste makes it easy to use.,4

17029,i still didn't get it.i don't know why.could you have a check and tell me why.,1
17030,"Soap is OK, and just that.  The cleansing unit is small and rough on one side, and simply plastic on the other.  Really disappointing.",1
17031,"Works like a charm, especially if you work like a man and need to scrub your day off your body.",5
17032,it works ok but it's a tiny can and very expensive,3
17033,The strips made my teeth hurt more after using them.....,1
17034,Have used Clearasil since I was a teenager.  It seems to work and I can't find any other product that works better.,4
17035,Got it as a gift for someone. For the money it was OK and the person did like the product.,4
17036,These fit the red kids sonicare.  They are great for my 7 yr old and 12 yr old.,5
17037,Great choice n the price is even better. Looking for a nude lip you won't be disappointed. Trust me !,4
17038,I really like this. It smells really nice too. Does the trick painlessly!,5
17039,I received the product and barely opened it and it was all melted. had to throw it away. such a shame,1
17040,I can't stop using it. I love feeling the water flow through my teeth.,4
17041,Shipping was fast. Blade dulls easily and not super sharp. Good beginner blade.,3
17042,"Don't smell much patchouli. It's more musky , very masculine. Gave it to my husband.",3
17043,"I like it for cold sores and blisters. It worked, but it doesn't work for me to remove spots.",4
17044,"It's wet when i received. I would like to return it, but I can't.",1
17045,Surprisingly it is effective for my younger sister but not for my mom!,3
17046,Not quite as effective as advertised but okay. Purchased for woman with very curly - almost kinky - hair.,3
17047,"Still had a bend in my hair with this. Not as bad as I normally do, but it is still there.",3
17048,Too heavy for my face and leaves a white residue.,3
17049,"Broke the first time I put it on.

17050,Nice size diamond but the stem is so short it can fall out easily,2
17051,"Comes with no protective case, otherwise a good product.",4
17052,"Great oil, however can make hair sticky. Doesn't have an oily feel once in the hair.",3
17053,These are great molds...some do have fine lines and are a bit difficult to get the actual mold out in one piece.,4
17054,"Really worthless, loud motor with absolutely no suction.  The suction literally wouldn't even budge a kleenex tissue off a tabletop.  In the garbage.",1
17055,Not adequate for really scrubbing as indicated.  Buy something else.,2
17056,Very pleased. My daughters wants to brush her teeth by herself.,4
17057,It is always nice to get what you need at your front door!,4
17058,"It arrived on time, but does not work. Don't waste your money!",1
17059,"I would have liked velcro or snaps to close instead of ties.  Very thin, so, we'll see how long it lasts",3
17060,"Just like many of the other reviews said, the hose breaks rather easily ( after about 50 uses) and is irreparable.  Incredibly disappointing.",2
17061,"After weeks of trying to remove age spots my wife and I gave up.

Bob",2
17062,"Worked great for about two months, after that, it died, not to be resuscitated.
Absolute GARBAGE! Will never buy a Norelco product again.",1
17063,Love this lotion! Smells like you're at the spa!,4
17064,Such a lovely color and feels much more hydrating than other mattes. Doesn't stay on for too long though.,4
17065,Not as hydrating as I thought it would be. Does not absorb quickly.,4
17066,Very cheaply made and had no power. I realize it was inexpensive but disappointed due to product description stating the opposite.,1
17067,What more can you say if you gave it 5 stars,5
17068,I live in the tropics and this edge holds my hair better than most leading brands. Goes on white but the colour subsides.,4
17069,I have only had this product a couple of months.  It has already broken.  I can't keep the roller on the brush.,1
17070,"Great toothbrush, great price.  Timer good for little kids.  What more can you ask for.",5
17071,"Bummed out bc they were cute,  but made my nose horribly itchy. Too cheaply made ",1
17072,"One strip yielded results for about a week for me. Does what it says, but does not last as long as expected.",3
17073,Worst polish ever! CHIPS CHIPS CHIPS. It doesnt even last a day.  I like essie original but this is junk,1
17074,Nice but not as big as I thought it was going to be but it does keep my purse meet and in order.,4
17075,This is the best dental product for healthy gums and teeth.  Easy to use!,5
17076,Great product. Has lasted a long time and does the trick.,5
17077,"Nice stuff, will just take some getting use to as I haven't worn liquid makeup for a while",4
17078,It works. I just feel that I will need to purchase more of the smaller sizes but over all it works for me.,3
17079,Works as advertised and lasts a long time (based on my prior purchase some time ago;  the aroma could be a bit stronger.,4
17080,"I real feel the difference in my skin, after two weeks using this cream my face feels ticker and fresh.",4
17081,"They don't last long, because they don't stick very well. Will not order again.",2
17082,cant beat this for the price. it works great. use for gel nails or regular polish with gel over top.,5
17083,"Other than hair about 4-6 inches tending to get tangled in the teeth, it does the job.",4
17084,This is the only one that worked and I real do like the product.,1
17085,the pictures are deceiving.  They did not work with my glasses.,1
17086,"I like the product to soon to tell how well it works, but way over priced for what you get.",4
17087,I love it because it is perfect for the rings and bracelet that I display for photo shooting and also for sizing.,5
17088,mild scented and ideal for those who do not like the fruity smell of some soaps.  very close to the oil of olay unscented body wash.,5
17089,When i got this it had a few problems. Including screws being stripped and i was not able to use it.,1
17090,battery holds charge and recharges quickly. i think it is a great value for costs and works for my limited use,4
17091,"I've bought these before, and love them again. But don't expect a variety of colors. I got 4 grey ones.",4
17092,"Don't work quite as well as hoped at getting the white gunk off, but still nice to know her retainers are clean in between good cleanings.",4
17093,This didn't seem to do much of anything for my hair.,2
17094,"Smells good, starting to work. Pores seem clearer, have been using for 1 month.",4
17095,"I returned this supplement because it did not arrive refrigerated, as required.",2
17096,I love this product.  It works well with my hair.  I was happy that amazon had this product.  Amazon offers so many wonderful products.,5
17097,Hands down my fav blush. use as a highlighter or tap it on with a bit more on the brush for color.,5
17098,"It heats up, but it doesn't curl the lashes at all. Wasted money.",1
17099,Awful smell and grungy chunks.  I was embarrassed to give it as a gift but glad to get rid of the smell to someone else,1
17100,One roll of tape for $25.  Total rip off.,1
17101,Smears easily - which is precisely what I did not want.,3
17102,this was a replacement for an older model that broke after 3 years. The only thing I don't like is the stickers come off pretty easy,4
17103,These work really well!!! Just feels like a retainer.,4
17104,This took a long time to ship but the product itself is great!,4
17105,These are beautiful colors and highly lustrous. The pieces are big so the need to be deliberately applied.,4
17106,Great color. Goes on okay. Lasts a decent amount of time,4
17107,"This is very helpful to sleep with, I love it. I would recommend this to people who are going natural",5
17108,Works great! I like the attachment. It's really quiet and very discreet.,5
17109,"Too flimsy, they bunch up my toes instead of separating.",1
17110,"This can't be what they are charging over $100 for? Smelled terrible, did nothing for me after 3 weeks and felt slimy.",1
17111,Can't figure out how to work this. No directions.,3
17112,"Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser

17114,"It's just, OK. It's smell is very different than regular Aqua Velva. Nothing to write home about.",3
17115,I don't really know if this helps or not hahaha,3
17116,bottles are not the regular size you think they are but still a awesome value,4
17117,Exactly what I needed! Goggles are of durable quality - seems they will last a while,4
17118,Gift for friend who had foot surgery. Light is nice & bright. Perfect for what he needed.,5
17119,"Pretty thick. I had to cut the bangs back a bit, but then it was perfect.",4

17130,"I like this stuff! It feels cool to the touch, and seems to reduce puffiness around eyes. Feels good on skin, and absorbs quickly.",3
17131,For being a repair conditioner it works ok. I have to put other products on when I am done to tame the hair and make it look smooth,3
17132,I love the saints but I am so dissapointed in this tanning sticker. They don't stick to your skin at all.,1
17133,This was a Christmas gift. It came as advertised. he used it and was happy with it. It was okay.,4
17134,"These earrings broke before I even got them out of the package! After a little super glue, cute earrings though.",2

17142,Very good so far. Nothing fell apart or anything and for their price this is a very good deal. But I didn't get a receipt,4
17143,My hair is too fine and gets tangled in the brush.,2
17144,Love it. Wish the edge of it wasn't as pointy.,4

17147,"Didn't take too long to arrive, well packaged, no issues so I am a happy customer.",5
17148,I like the set the only thing is that the wax needs to be on for a long time for it to melt properly,3
17149,Excellent blade. Shaves better than my electric razor. No razor bumps after shaving .,5
17150,"The quality of the brushes were cheap and the size was misleading.
I would recommend not buying this product. I was ultimately unsatisfied with this purchase.",1
17151,I've purchased these several times for us & I love how well they work.,5
17152,I recently bought one and it s really thick. Is that normal or no??!!,1
17153,the hold is great. shine is excellent. wear a bonnet/ durag or get satin or silk pillowcases.,4

17160,All gems fall out. 1/2 came already out. Too small to find and glue back in.,1
17161,"OK, I have used other henna products that were stronger and more effective.",4
17162,"This is really a 5 star product. I should have ordered a different color, nonetheless, I can still use it. It's that useful.",5

17166,I have used them before and  they work out just fine,4
17167,"Awesome product, wish I would have found this years ago!! It holds without being sticky or stiff. Makes curls super bouncy!",5
17168,They fit just fine and they are so comfortable.  I think I am going to enjoy wearing them a lot!,4
17169,Poor visibility--lighter than a lip color -so it would need to be combined with another and it doesn't stay on.,2

17175,Love this stuff but only one star because I ONLY GOT 1 STICK!! Change your description and stop stealing from people!!,1

17177,Overall I like the product but I though the gems would be a little bigger. They are tiny. The colors are beautiful.,4
17178,Its not give a strong scrub as I need it to. And it doesnt have a hunging loop thing as shown on picture.,3
17179,Good bath gloves. A little tight though. Beautiful orange color.,4
17180,I generally replace the HS85 Shaving Unit every 3 months or so as recommended. This product was exactly as specified. It does the job quite well.,5
17181,Was hopeful this line would work for my skin since the reviews were great. Unfortunately I had more breakouts than ever and had to stop using it.,3
17182,Bought this for my husband and while he seemed to like it the scent was a bit strong and odd.,4
17183,Great gloves but it won't last long. Expect to buy more in near future,4

17193,works fine does the job.should use every day for perfect results.,4
17194,Shipping was fast! Can't wait to try it in my hair oil. Looking forward to buying more soon.,5
17195,It does add some color over he roots.  I use I the last week before I'm going to the salon and I helps.,3
17196,Really cute. Shipping took along time but it was worth it.,4
17197,The container leaked all over my purse. It is a very hot cinnamon flavor.,2
17198,This product is great it adds shine and moisture to your hair and doesn't add any weight to your hair this oil is light and amazing.,4
17199,Cheap material. Top came ripped. Much larger than expected. Would not order this again.,2
17200,Great tool for a great price. Out of hygiene you should aim to replace these every few weeks but they can last for several months.,5
17201,I have used many Avalon Organics products. this one is not what I was expecting and I don't feel it cleanses my face well.,3
17202,bought it as a gift and was missing a color. Also took nearly two weeks to arrive.,2

17211,I love this machine. So much more efficient than regular flossing!,5
17212,"The case is good and does its job, but the clips keep slipping off. And I haven't found many other options for colors.",2
17213,Did not work at all per advertised  - followed directions exactly.  Do not buy and waste your money!,1
17214,Not as effective as higher end models. There is a reason this is the lowest price Braun. Better as a stand by than a daily shaver.,2
17215,Larger and heavier than expected but functions well. Hair dries quickly.,4
17216,not functional for long hair. hair does get tangled and pulls on hair.,3
17217,"These are good in theory, but they don't stick to my clothing.",2
17218,This Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser is easy to use and does everything one would expect from this product. It is compact and quiet.,4

17221,GF uses them in the tanning bed. She is happy.,5

I was disappointed because What I ordered wasn't what I received.",2
17224,"This Barber Jacket..... ADDS A TOUCH OF CLASS to my place and my guy love it.

17225,It's a little chalky. But I like the color.,3
17226,"It's toooooooooo bright! But yes, really moisture and good smell.",4
17227,"Works as expected.

Now I just need to get into the habit of using it daily.",4
17228,Cute but smaller than expected and a bit hard to stay in for me,4
17229,A hunk of junk. Lasted less than a week. I never had a shaver last less than two years. Last norelco I would buy.,1

17233,I have ordered this product before and it worked so good on my kids that I started using it also.  Great product!,4
17234,Both the GymBar and DVD were defective.  Thankfully I got a refund. Don't waste your money on this,2
17235,This said brand new.  one lipstick came half wrapped up and the other not wrapped up at all.  i don't know if they were used.,2
17236,Did not work in the application of  a full lace wig.  The product did not work at all.,1
17237,Good alternative for regular floss but not as effective. I still do regular floss some time this is just an alternative to save some time.,4
17238,I love it because it's gets really soapy and produces a lot of suds,4
17239,Terrible suction. Two of the four valves arrived with tears. Go with the Hygeia brand.,1
17240,This didn't cause anyone else to break out? I developed milia (hard to pop white pearl-like acne) with using this product. Discontinued use.,2
17241,"I was extremely pleased with the product, its arrival, and everything!  I use these and will def be purchasing more!",4
17242,Not tried it yet but I'm hoping it'll be fine.,4
17243,"Nice looking bowl, will see how to use it and how it weathers being wet and drying alternatively.",4
17244,This product smells great and works quite well.  BUT...it does not work as well as Avon Moroccan Argan Oil Leave-In Treatment at only $12.00!,3
17245,Good product that does exactly as described. I took one star away because the brush I have doesn't fit either side.,4
17246,I would not even give it a 1 star.  I will not use them.,1

17249,I checked the price of this product and I paid a  little too much for it.,3

all teeth.",4
17252,"Great color, great product. My makeup must have!",5

17254,"Can't really rate the product as this was a gift.  However, I have not heard any complaints.",4
17255,Never got to use it because it never heated up.  Very disappointed.,1
17256,Arrived as ordered.  This goo is a pretty darn good pain reliever.  Does not stink of perfume.  Goes on smooth.,4
17257,Figured the reason this works for headaches is that the searing pain in your nostrils distracts from the pain in your head.,2
17258,I am totally happy with this purchase. It would have been better to leave out the toothbrush and tongue cleaner and give extra jets.,3
17259,This was bought a year ago and it is still being used with no damage.,5
17260,"covers like stage makeup! heavy! a little goes a very long way... a bit much for everyday, but great for under eyes darkness",3
17261,My tooth brush gives off more viberations than this things does. I am very displeased. It will never even be used.,1

Would not buy again or recommend.",1
17265,I love this cream and the fact it is not tested on animals!,5

17268,Is it amazing produc I'm very happy with Aveda damage remedy . My hair so shinny now I love it !!!,4
17269,"Works well, but the perfume is a little too strong for my taste.",4
17270,Jaws are poorly ground and only contact each other at the tip. Buy another brand of you want a clipper like this.,1
17271,This curling brush is O.K. Doesn't seem to get as hot as I would like it to.,3
17272,Got all clear stones and no colored. But not expensive so no big deal.,3
17273,Did not fit my latherwhip shaving brush or muhle razor.,1
17274,I find the plaque brush to be a great help and there are several different tips for differing needs.  Also the design is clever and space efficient,5
17275,Color darker than I though.  The lipstick does not have a bad taste like many others.,3
17276,"After several years, my first Body Groomer blew it's circuitry in Africa.  Replace it as soon as I returned to the States.",4
17277,"too small for a bible, too busy to return, lost 20$",1
17278,i do agree with half size issue but i was still able to go from a 8mm to a 9mm,4
17279,Takes away the nasty poop and pee smell in the yard so we can sit on our porch and enjoy the outdoors,5

17283,I did see a bit of a different on my left side of the face but not my right side l still continue to use it every day.,3
17284,So so.  Not as good as an arm band kit.,2
17285,So not what I expected it to be. not certain if I entirely like the results it yeilded. I'll try again and see.,3
17286,"Very good quality floss, especially for narrow spaces between the teeth.",5
17287,Love that it reaches inside areas not reachable with the shorter version.,4
17288,I LOVE THESE CARDS.  THEY ARE SO CHEERY AND WELL RECEIVED WHEN PEOPLE GET THEM.,5
17289,"I'm not pleased with this item it is waaay to big and also too big for my shower tiles.
I wanted something small and dainty.",1
17290,The product is good but I hate the packaging. Very disappointed . The cream came off a hole on the top side of it and its a waste,1
17291,Works great so far.  The adjustable attachment works very well and seems nice and secure so it doesn't slip to a different level while trimming .,4
17292,this was a fun activity for my baby shower guests and hope to use the headbands for my baby girl once she arrives!,4
17293,"Get something a lot more powerful if you want to use it for thickened toenails.  Nice for ordinary fingernails, however.",3

17302,very good cleaner and i ill buy more for friends if u love to clean ur moth buy it now,5
17303,"Going to take time to get comfortable using them.  I think they'll work in the long run, but I was uncomfortable with them at first.",3
17304,"Brush was perfect; however, it took too long for delivery!",4
17305,Not greasy on face and arms. Does take away chlorine smell.,4

17350,Pointless product... Only good for a day... Adhesive wears out... Don't buy this product waste of money,1
17351,It seems as if 3 out of 5 razors in each box are flawed.  This pack of 100 has made me consider electric shaving.,2

17362,It's okay for the price. I wouldn't compare it to Bare Minerals though.,3
17363,It is a good product. There is a big difference betwen this and other shaving creams when you use it with Norelco razor.,4
17364,I received an EMPTY padded envelope!  I didn't realize it until I opened the package today to use it!,1

17372,Excellent product for my type of skin. I highly recommend it . I would like to see better pricing deals,4
17373,"Perfect for keeping hair off the clothes.  It's easy to put on and easy to take off, and easy to clean.",5
17374,Hate these pens!  The pens are NOT multicolored and the ink runs out after a few uses. would not buy again.,1
17375,I liked them. They were cute. About what I expected.,3
17376,It will get the longer hairs trimmed but for a close shave you have to use a foil shaver or a razor.,3
17377,"Good, but save a plastic dropper/glass pipette to get the liquid out and into your nail polish.",4
17378,If you have extra dry cuticles not the best option. Still looking for something better.,3
17379,My hair loves it!  First time in years I can hear my hair squeak after I wash it!  Wonderful products.,5
17380,A co-worker recommended this to me and im so glad she did! The product came within 2 days and its such a great color.,4
17381,This is NOT mehron and not safe to use on skin.,1
17382,Not seeing any improvements and frustrated by promises.  Will keep looking for something else.,3
17383,The toe seam is no longer flat and is lumpy instead.  Rubs on my toes.  Not happy with the change.,1
17384,The haircolor is orange and white.  Not like picture.,2
17385,Junk! It fell apart within the first 5 minutes of getting it,1
17386,It works as I remembered.  I used to have one as a child.  My teeth feel cleaner after use.,4
17387,"cheap only 3 blades, not worth the cash. BIC should stick to making pens",2
17388,"works great, very sharp, i use them for cutting vinyl",4
17389,I love mine. They worked perfectly and shipping was pretty fast.,5
17390,"I have extremely thick hair and this barrette will probably work, although I was looking for a larger one, that is more of a 4"".",3
17391,It's perfect but I find difficulties in locking it you need someone to help you in wearing,4
17392,Integrated mustache trimmer and a more positive lock on the height adjustment would make this a much better product.,4
17393,This is basically just expensive petroleum and water (vaseline)  that is very overpriced.  Stick with the white and thicker creams and lotions.,2
17394,"This is thick, but it doesnt fix wrinkles, doesnt even hydrate your skin",2
17395,"I like the coverage this provides, but feel ripped off every time I can hear liquid in the container and no more will spray out.",4
17396,3 days later and I still am having trouble with clogged pores and heat rash. It also does not absorb into the skin well.,1
17397,"The second time I tried to use it, instead of it working, it just got really hot.",1
17398,"Love them!  The others were given as gifts and they love them, too!",5
17399,"I have very short hair, and although it's the narrowest I could find, it's really hardly usable on most of my hair.",3
17400,I love Zum soap but these bars are so thin they only last for a few uses and the rest is wasted. Disappointed.,2
17401,does a great job of cleaning teeth but it makes a lot of mess especially when putting the handle away,4
17402,Gift for senior. Perfect. Very fast shipping. No problems.,5
17403,I had a Remington product before this one which was noisy. This product is quiet and does the job well. I'm happy with my purchase.,4
17404,Didn't work for me because I discovered I had a lupus rash.,2
17405,The bowl is suitable for its purpose. Looks nice and well made. Good product for the price. Thanks Amazon.,4
17406,"Didn't work for me D:  Really wanted it to!  Secret Body Spray works, though.",1
17407,"My boyfriend's trimmers actually trim my hair. These don't even come close. Terrible purchase, don't bother. Get a guy's trimmers.",1
17408,"good blades at the best price , what can I say they get the job done don't cost much at all .",4
17409,Used this for a week without noticeable results. Maybe I have to use it daily for a longer period of time? I'll keep at it.,3
17410,I bought this for my daughter skin and it clear it up but you have to use it everyday. It's good,5
17411,"Works well, takes practice. Arrived quickly with extra thread which is a big plus!",4
17412,I am very satisfied with this product because it does a very good job.,4
17413,Sorry didn't work for me!  Gave it to my daughters friend.,1
17414,I like these brushes they are very soft they look good the case is material not plastic but that's ok.,5
17415,Am pleased with the results of the waterpick. Does a great job and massages my gums. It was a worthwhile purchase!,4
17416,"Not professional quality as advertised. Can give a descent front edge up, but not useful on the face or neck.",3
17417,It was only one tag would've been better with a second one,4
17418,wife had one a few years back it stopped working she loves this one very much,4
17419,It's cheap quality and very strong...it doesn't smooth in with my akin,2
17420,If they discontinued this scent I would go postal. <3,5
17421,Nice eyeshadow but glitter only on top layer after that just regular eyeshadow,3
17422,It's okay. A little bit dry for my lips.,3
17423,Too small for my needs. I should have looked at the measurements more closely.  Shipping was fast. Over priced for size.,3
17424,"Doesn't work at all on my hair extensions but on the plus side, it smells great.",2
17425,"Wax is a little thick but the kit is very helpful! You don't need to buy anything else, it comes with everything you need!",4
17426,I purchased this as a gift. It arrived promptly. My cousin liked it.,4
17427,Nail dryer didn't work. However my money was refunded with in 48 hours.,4
17428,"don't but this never in your life, it didn't take no hair off you, it doesn't work at all, garbage",1
17429,It is a lovely bracelet!  Granddaughters should enjoy them very much!,4
17430,Works fine. Got grey color instead of red or black though. Not as nice-looking bit still works as advertised. 2nd purchase.,4
17431,So glad to find these replacement bulbs for my makeup mirror!,5
17432,The intensity of the hot hair is not as good as it could be but otherwise a good value,4
17433,I did design different w any nail with diamond. Someday i will get order more different gems mixed later smile,4
17434,"Horrible, not what is advertised, it's like a very thick sticker, not to use with suimsuit or even under it, non-discreet at all.",1
17435,"The bar is crooked,but it fits well it is a small bar.",2
17436,"i bought this for my dad. I got it when there has a good deal. So, i think it is valuable.",4
17437,"it doesn't work..and the smell gives me headache
Won't buy it and won't recommend it.",1
17438,"least fav of poppy products... oily gets stuck in hair, takes forever to rinse out... hence causes hair to dry. smelly and stinky too.",2
17439,Acceptable. Not great but fine if you need a pair to try or replace.,3
17440,i would get more of these-did the trick and live sucking on them  :),5
17441,Smells amazing...but still left my daughters hair tangly. I bought it off of a referral from a lady I met.,3
17442,it is extremely difficult to use because the part that holds the hair flops all over,1
17443,Worked for less than 24hrs- even after multiply applications - back to the search for a product that works!,2
17444,the front of the wig looks nothing like the pictures. its a bit more messy but the braid looks good.,3
17445,Brought it to raise stubble for shaving. Doesn't do that for me but does protect sensitive skin during shaving.,3
17446,Love Helen of Troy products and this is no exception.,4
17447,My other one quit after several years... and I really missed it.  My mouth fees so much better after a good cleaning with my waterpik.,4
17448,Only been using a short while but my skin seems softer. Smell is pleasant too.,4
17449,Worked great and did the job well. My teeth are clean and white.,4
17450,Oil leaks out easily and comes apart. Would not recommend.,1
17451,Doesn't work at all and if you have a toothache you are better off trying to find some clove oil instead.,1
17452,Does make it easier and comfortable to shave with this product,4
17453,its a nice soap but runs out way too quickly. a bar lasted me two to three showers. ridiculous.,2
17454,"While I do like this product and its color, this wasn't the color i thought it to be. It was more pink/mauve than red.",4
17455,"1) nice NATURAL tanning results..no fakey jersey shore color.
2) some skin smoothing / toning benefits
3) very pleasant smell and non greasy",4
17456,I ordered the color 218  and I got a white paste - I think wherever they manufactured it they confused 218 with 208,1
17457,"It makes my skin fell so dry, I don't like it.",2
17458,Finally something that works as well as Lucky 13 brand Swagger pomade. I was really bummed out when Swagger was discontinued,5
17459,"Not worth it , ripped after using 2 times , wish I would of payed more for a better Quality item",1
17460,"Arrived on time, packed well, worked as advertised. Only rated a four because haven't used enough to rate durability.",4
17461,"I ordered the 3pack, the material inside the bottle is old and smells strange!!",2
17462,"I loved these!! The color doesnt smudge like some, and also they stay on forever even with just a clear top coat:)",5
17463,My 62 year old weathered neck loved it and my face has also responded well.  I will continue to buy it,4
17464,Love it ....but it had a very strong chemical smell when I first got it.,4
17465,Nothing like the picture! The print is completely different and alot smaller! I'm extremely disappointed!,1
17466,I like it but prefer their shea butter black soap even more.  The scent of the black soap is my favorite.,4
17467,I like the product.. good quality and great customer service from the suppliers. The brushes are nice and soft. Great for the price,4
17468,I ordered the lotion but received the bodywash.  Was hoping to use them as stocking stuffers.  Not very happy.,1
17469,This didn't work on my skin type. It made my face look like it was falling apart. Too dry and flaky,3
17470,I Like the item very much but wish it had a traveling case to available and it was included.,4
17471,"Smells great but its a little watery. However, I can't wait to use it on my daughter",4
17472,"You can see the card backs through the yellow.  So, they are no good to hide/mix cards, but okay for protection.",2
17473,"This is a wonderful comb.  It is sturdy, very handsome, and feels great on the scalp.",5
17474,"This is a very good Gillette product. Smells nice, works well. I've got absolutely no complaints.",4
17475,"Did not gloss my hair at all, not worth the money.",2
17476,Fantastic product!  Balances estrogen in your body.  Everyone should take these.,5
17477,This was very convenient for washing hair at home. The adjustable height of the bowl was a plus.,5
17478,really stops gum bleeding while brushing. used it as a free sample from palama market (Hon. Hi) just dab it on your tooth paste.,4
17479,This is a piece of garbage and you'll just be frustrated if you buy it.,1
17480,Great shave not the best quality but for the price and quantity you can not beat it,4
17481,Great product! Glad to be able to purchase it on Amazon after it was discontinued by its company. Thanks!,4
17482,worked wonders on my hair and smelled similar to baby shampoo.,5
17483,this moisturizer works great to hydrate skin after being exposed to a tanning bed or a long day in the sun and smells really good too!,4
17484,"Wasn't what I expected, but does do the job.",4
17485,A very good after shave lotion at a very reasonable price (inexpensive).,4
17486,Is absolutely cute!! Only worn a few times but hasn't broke! Love it!,5
17487,Not happy ordered them twice and i got the same wrong product theybsent me silicone baking matts no star from me,1
17488,Great product BUT DO NOT USE THIS SHIPPER!!!,1
17489,"The product is natural and effective. Toji has great care for its customers, order assistance and provide a great customer service",4
17490,"I received my order on time, and the products were not broken which I was afraid of.....the smell is heavenly Caress body washes never fail",4
17491,"very happy with the Waterpik water flosser, Works as advertised. Have used it for several months and am completely satisfied.",4
17492,Felt like gummy glue left in my hair.  Also made my hair greasy and didn't help with static.  I saw no difference in shine.,1
17493,Im very disappointed in this product. It is extremely drying on the lips.,2
17494,Nice holder. Does need board behind it to hang on flat surface.,4
17495,"Wattage was 25 watt and I had 30 watt, which I couldn't find....",4
17496,Nobly fights the good fight against gravity. Gravity hasn't won yet.,4
17497,I love this brand of soap for my face.  The colors are perfect in my bathroom.  It lasts a long time.,5
17498,"Works well, and is easy to clean. worth it for a quick shave.",4
17499,Blow air but no heat... do not know how to return if it heated it would most likely be great.,1
17500,"This product does what it is designed to do,  but then again so does Gold Bond, and it's a lot cheaper.",4
17501,The heart was bigger than I thought but it's good for the price.,3
17502,"I use this all the time. This is the first time I bought it here, because you had the better price.
Love the product.

Thanks",5
17503,Product works great. I like the attachments. Easy to use.,5
17504,"If you are a new user, watch out for the splash if you are not pressing the control properly, put some listerine on flushing.",3
17505,I love this scent of this body wash and I hope Boots never stops making it!  It is getting harder and harder to come by...,5
17506,Arrived this afternoon with half full bottle. It was like it had already been used. I could not believe it...,1
17507,Very happy with this product.  Great for skin and hair.  Would buy again.,4
17508,"Exact same ""flosser"" as the 900 series, but without the rechargeable toothbrush...",5
17509,"I need practice, but I'm really excite to use these for when I wear darker colors in the Spring.",4
17510,This water-pick works very well and gets used daily good product at a reasonable price.,5
17511,"Every person's face is different.  I have extremely sensitive skin and these seem to agree with me okay, but only last about 2 shaves.",3
17512,I though it would have hair blowing with the roll brush.  It is a hot iron with no air.,2
17513,"they don't go through all the way in your nose , only to the end of the pirecing",3
17514,"Didn't last very long.  I've had others that lasted much, much longer.",2
17515,"This actually works pretty well, but can't use sparingly.",4
17516,It may be my fault because I did not look more into it but I was disappointed when I only got one pair in.,3
17517,"VERY LONG SHIP TIME but once received was good for the price!
The quality is decent. The lil' plastic case is small but simple.",3
17518,I GOT TO GET SOME MORE BECAUSE MY BATHS ARE BECOMING KINDA LAME WITHOUT THIS LIQUID SOAP SO FOR NOW I AM OKAY,5
17519,"Works perfectly does what it is supposed to do keeps the top of the sink nice and neat
Good quality",5
17520,It smells amazing but doesn't make suds like Dr. Bronnner's castile soap. I won't buy again.,3
17521,The handle is a really good fit and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a new razor. It just feels really good in your hand.,4
17522,They are a good size and quality and come in a cute box!,5
17523,great product. doesn't stop bleeding as good as the classic styptic pen but still very good,4
17524,This is perfect and works like a professional barbershops Cape. Made me feel special lol.,5
17525,"works better that floss at removing food stuck between teeth & gum.
Use it before I floss with Plackers.  Should also work well on braces.",4
17526,I was absolutely meticulous on how I used these whitening trays...no results. Save your money.,1
17527,"its cleans my hair. but i still have flakes. thats me and my dry skin though, your mileage may vary.",3
17528,Just ordered my second tube.  It does help plump up to cover lines.,4
17529,Great beginner brushes. Bristles are really soft and good quality! Super fast shipping! Came in 4-5 days.,4
17530,Wernets is the best. I prefer the Ultra Wernets and have for some time.,1
17531,trays are small and way to flexible to hold in place.  too bad because the whitener seems to work fairly well.,2
17532,I don't really know what this is for. Seems ok but shave is the same whether I use it or not.,3
17533,Threw it away.  Cheap and useless.  I'd have better luck with a scrap of old fabric. This wouldn't even stay on my head.,1
17534,"Hard to tell, haven't used it for that long yet.",3
17535,Ouch! This sucker pinches skin and tugs hairs out.,3
17536,The Eye Shields were fine but arrived in a package covered in pink stuff.  Maybe a dried pink lotion.  It was gross.,3
17537,"Pretty cheaply made, but for the price I wouldn't expect much more. Still can wear them, just watch out since sometimes the rinestones pop out",3
17538,They are quality blades. One of the better blades I have used.,4
17539,Great results. Be patient takes a few weeks to really see change.,4
17540,Kind of wish I'd stuck with Derbys. Didn't seem to be as sharp.,2
17541,Within a couple weeks most of the brush heads fell off of the sticks.,1
17542,The consistency is good. My eyes feel awake in the morning after using it over night.,4
17543,This was recommended to me by someone.  I use it regularly & notice the positive results.,5
17544,I love the product was bummed that is was a late delivery.,3
17545,The young lady I bought it for loves it. The foil covering is rather delicate but so pretty.,4
17546,Brighter than I expected. The color looks more rich in the photos but it is a much brighter red.,2
17547,"They should come with the wire attached so we don't have to solder. Otherwise, they are fine.",4
17548,This stuff is super thick. Unable to apply a thin layer. Messy and Awful.,2
17549,Amazon was great. But this product not so much. I spent 2 days trying it. I got like 5 hairs removed. Not happy,1
17550,I love this stuff and it's soooo much cheaper than buying it at the sex shop. You get 3 for the price of one.,4
17551,"Damaged Goods. My package was damaged, the stand was missing a leg and the product was small. Don't buy!!!",1
17552,Made my hair super dry & brittle! Color is good but don't think its all natural. Made my hair fall more.,2
17553,"Works nicely for dry skin, but doesn't help with psoriasis. Good product, though. Worth the cost for a vitamin e cream..",4
17554,Was hoping for something better than disposable quality. They scratch and scraped regardless of how long I soaked and prepared my whiskers. Would not buy again.,2
17555,"Tore me up ,the blade is not a sharp blade at all. I would not recommend these. I will stick with feather or shark.",1
17556,"They said they were sterling silver but are not, they make ur finge green, did not like.",1
17557,This razor is pretty good. I shave everyday and this razor provides a comfortable shave.  I don't cut myself as often.,4
17558,Very oily and heavy. Like a layer of wax. Not recommended,1
17559,"This smells nothing like Tom Ford. Whoever posted it does must have never smelled it, thanks for the fake review. Smells terrible!!!",1
17560,color is much lighter than pictured almost a nude color. nice prodcut tho,4
17561,"THIS WAS FOR MY DAUGHTER, WHO LOVES IT AND USES IT EVERY DAY
WHICH MAKES ME HAPPY.GUESS I'LL GET ONE FOR MYSELF TOO.",5
17562,"Great stuff!  Would recommend definitely.  Lasts long time this product, looks fantastic and very natural.  Good value need a brush.",5
17563,"I've never been a huge fan of flossing, but this machine gets the job done and makes the process a whole lot less painful and messy.",4
17564,"These razors are sharp enough to get the job done without tearing my face apart, what else do I need?",5
17565,You definitely see results the puffiness is visibly reduced as well as fine lines. I would recommend for quick more youthful eyes,4
17566,all i can say is.. i wouldn't have bought this in person,1
17567,"WORKS GREAT, FINALLY WENT TO DENTIST, WISH HE USED IT.",4
17568,I bought this tubing because of the non-kinking factor. I need to change too often because it gets tangled quickly.,3
17569,"easy to handle, could cut wiskers a little easier, must go over face a few times before it is clean shaven.",4
17570,The eye mask has somehow stained my pillow case. The ink has bled and the pillow cases are ruined. Not pleased about this.,1
17571,Wish this was just a tad deeper so the soap when brand new would fit in here with the lid on,4
17572,Prefect type of razor for my face. I would recommend trying several types of razors before buying a large supply of them.,4
17573,Love this stuff!  Helps super dry skin without any irritation if you have sensitive skin!,4
17574,This is a piece of crap.!! No wonder it is so low in cost. I don't recommend it to anyone!!,1
17575,I've only had it 2 1/2 months and the bottom of it is cracked and leaking. Will not buy again,1
17576,Its a bit strong for kids. But it cleaned great.,3
17577,"Cute, affordable brushes! Used my promo code and they were even MORE affordable :)",5
17578,I wanted something to give me the edge in social settings but this was not it it smells good but thats about it,2
17579,Works just like it is supposed to.  Wish I could get it with a smaller barrel.,4
17580,I have  used this product many years and found it to be very good.,4
17581,nice piece for my bathroom. The only thing I would change is to make the razor side larger to fit modern razors- my Gillette doesn't fit.,4
17582,I gave up on shaving cream years ago... I received this in a birch box sample and I love it!!! Great price!,4
17583,"Great deal, each bar is a different scent. Love the clean non slimy way it,leaves your skin feeling",5

17587,I love this waxing kit! But when it was delivered to me the lid to the waxing pot was broken :(,3
17588,"i have noticed it seems to help my gums a bit but i still need to regular floss, which is dissapointing",4
17589,They won't stay in place for 1 minute. ..more less 10 minutes.  I threw them away...what a waste.,1
17590,Very cute but stiff.  However for the price?  Its PERFECT.,4
17591,"Not the sharpest, but smooth once you've worn off the coating.
Lasts a long time and works well on my very wiry beard",5
17592,"Did not prevent razor burn as hoped  , one of the pumps stopped working .",2
17593,Very sturdy. I would give it higher marks but most of my brushes don't fit unless I put them in where the bristles attach.,3
17594,"Rhinestones fell off after a couple of days, you definitely get what you pay for!",2
17595,Found a wonderful product for twisting my hair. It truly held my twists together and did not cause anhy frizz to them,5
17596,A very good product but too small compared to its price,2
17597,Love the product HATE the new price. Its double wow.,1
17598,This Norelco beard trimmer is really great. It is quiet and light and does an excellent trimming job.,4
17599,Seems like an effective way to floss. My ultimate satisfaction will be determined at my next dentist appointment.,4
17600,"Clean smelling , every women I asked to smell it said it was nice! They aren't throwing themselves at me but",4
17601,It worked for our son's wolverine costume. Little big though for a toddlar,3
17602,"Nice coverage, it's a little light for my liking, so I'll need to use a dark pencil.",4
17603,Didn't think it was cheap plastic and way too long to even try to use.,2
17604,Awesome product! Works well on my natural curls and my daughter's relaxed hair. Will buy again.,5
17605,"Perfect shade, doesn't feel heavy or sticky like most lip products. Doesn't last long though.",4
17606,It does not work as well for me as the gel.,4
17607,String is thin and the sunnies were very stiff and didn't fit to the curve of my face.,4
17608,you can't use it when is uncharged no matter if it's plugged in. works great for face but not for my nose trees,3
17609,I order a Carmel an I got beige this is not wat I order this is a scam,1
17610,Only problem is the neck piece won't stay on.,4
17611,"Quick delivery.  Love this product....
Be sure to follow proper use/application",5
17612,blends great! I wish I didn't have to wash so often and could use on different colors but it holds onto product.,4
17613,Packing was poor job. Spilled all over. Wasn't too heart broken because I don't like the smell. Way too strong for a baby.,1
17614,"I bought this for my daughter, she loves it, had tons of colors and shapes, she loves to decorate her nails.",5
17615,Good product.  Teeth are much better and healthier according to my dentist after years of use of this product.,5

17624,The vibration sound is annoying and my head feels sick while brushing. But the quality is good.,4
17625,I have used Norelco shavers for many years. This latest model does a good job shaving and is easy to use and clean.,4
17626,Product it is fine but do NOT order it from Key Zone . It took almost 2 months to received my item,3
17627,"Ordered this and only received one floss, not 6.",1
17628,I wish I had tried a scented version.  I don't think it is sting enough unscented for my 6 year old.,2
17629,I received the item but am really disappointed to find the mirror is stained and the stain cannot be removed.,3
17630,"great overall brush for all types of hair, even natural!",5
17631,love hot air dryers and are so hard to find.. however the teeth on this one are a tad longer than I want..but it will have to work,3
17632,"Mine came with a scratch, so one side of it cannot be used without hurting my skin, they shouldn't send stones with dents.",2
17633,"Not impressed.  Maybe it's my hair, but this didn't do it for me.",2
17634,Very attractive razor stand. If you use a straight razor like I do just lay the razor across the razor tines.,5
17635,and so does my husband.  The smell is pleasant and my babys skin feels so soft.  I will buy again!,4
17636,Not what I thought it was. Way to big to use with my Sisterlocks.,1
17637,Skin did not improve. Felt like using scented water.,1
17638,Doesn't pick up the makeup off the pallet very well.,3
17639,"Everything about this is good, except for the pockets. The seam of the pocket completely ripped out after only a month.",3
17640,"Pretty great, except the color is a bit chalky. The balm at the bottom was actually better than the lipstick.",4
17641,"It is light and I can wear it mornings and evenings. It helps minimize my wrinkles and fine lines, I believe.",4
17642,The Body Wash works ok. But is no better than cheaper stuff I get at walmart. I would buy again if the price was right,3
17643,happy to find a good deal on this waterpik from Amazon got for adult son to improve oral health and look forward to results  thank you,3
17644,Fast shipping however product has done nothing to improve dark spots on my face.,1
17645,"Very nice,  haven't used it long enough to know for sure how it is helping but so far so good.",4
17646,"This is not real shea moisture. The label is different, ingredients are different, and it definitely feels different on my babys hair.",1
17647,"OK blades,  too many nicks , don't last more than a couple of shaves.",3
17648,Thought it would be a soft pastel color. More orange than anticipated.,3
17649,Liked the product itself. Didn't like how there wasn't a Gage size option prior to ordering.,3
17650,It is difficult to put together without help & doesn't stay suctioned to wall. Would not recomend & very poorly made.,1
17651,its ok but the chains are realy week they broke in about  5 min after putting them on. other than that these were great,3
17652,very dry when i put it on it is very hard to apply but the color is great and bright,3
17653,I love this shampoo! everyone asks how I get my hair so shiny! and it feels so good!,5
17654,Buy this razor! It shaves just as good as a $300 razor. Was really impressed and i have crazy sensitive skin,5
17655,Decent little bottle. Cap doesn't snap shut. But it lives on my counter so that not a huge deal.,3
17656,"This is nice to knock off the stubs, but leaves my neck irritated if I use it after bumming for a couple of days.",4
17657,Seems like plain rubbing alcohol in an easy to use applicator.,3
17658,"The brushes are what u pay for the large brushes, powder brush , blending brushes, shed and poorly made. I wouldn't buy this again.",3
17659,A lot darker than the picture and needed some styling and more coloring for the roots but after I fixed it up it looks great!,4
17660,These rags are horrid. They seem like one you would use to clean the bathroom at a hotel. Gross and I returned it.,1
17661,Good for everyday or around the house. My husband likes the way it smells on me. I think it is good value for the price.,4
17662,Heats up quickey but the tip of the barrel gets to hot make ing it uncomfortable.,4
17663,It is extremely sticky so be careful if putting on soft skin.,4
17664,The brushes were fine but it didn't come with a bag.,1
17665,This is an okay product. Dosnt keep make up on too well when it's humid,3
17666,I have used this product for approximately 3 months.  It didn't do anything for me.,1
17667,Love this calendar. I can see it from across the room.,5
17668,Cocoa butter is really hard. The smell is overwhelming too.,3
17669,"This shaving product is very smooth, don't feel dry after shave. It can be use with shaver cream or without. Excellent Product",4
17670,Is really nice I bought for my Lil sister. I love the colors but the brushes is to small for an adult,4
17671,Not very happy at all with these. The jewels came out same day I put it in.,1
17672,The scent is has an undertone of plumeria but other wood notes are also there.,3
17673,I spray this on everything! I even mix it with my vitamin C. Love it. I go through several bottles a month. Worth every penny.,5
17674,I have always  had a hard time flossing. But with the Humming Bird I find flossing a breeze. I love it.,4
17675,Works very well. I use it every time I go dancing. Keep my make up on all night,4
17676,This works great!  Last until you shampoo.  Highly recommend!,5
17677,for someone who has dental problems this works wonders.  Used several times a day is best.  This is especially good with braces.,4
17678,exceptionally quiet.  gives a nice close shave.  I particularly like the hot water rinsing-cleaning feature.,4
17679,I like this water pic a lot. Very happy with this purchase.,5
17680,Great vest but runs extremely small.  I am a 1x (sometimes 2x) and even sometimes an XL...this will not fit an XL comfortably.,3
17681,the smell is too strong and the pieces are too thin.,1
17682,They are pretty but comes in very small wheel and not full like image shows.,2
17683,It helps hold my elastic stakings in position all day.,4
17684,Too tight and small for my face.  The protective lens popped out after two uses.  Item has been trashed.,1
17685,Average performance and less close than the less expensive Remington I am using.,3
17686,The smell is a bit too old-lady like for me but it's a nice soft lotion,4
17687,Fast shipping.  These clips are lighter than metal clips (better for fine hair) and blend in with my hair color better.,5
17688,This not the red I was hoping for but I worked great in my soaps.,4
17689,Just got my order on Thursday and the monomer is coming out like glue. I want to return or get another bottle,1
17690,I like it but prefer their shea butter black soap even more.  The scent of the black soap is my favorite.,4
17691,Good quality toe separators. Great colors and flexible to move between toes. Will be buying these again,5
17692,Best for kids.. i am using Aquaphor my kids since 6 yrs...,5
17693,I had high hopes for this serum but it simply doesnt work! Dont waste your money!,1
17694,"it is really nice and soft, the number of brushes made it easier for me and more interesting to apply my make up..like them alot",4
17695,Looks cool but hard to get into the cracks if ya know what i mean,3
17696,"This is so much better than a traditional bump it hair product. Easy to use, soft, stays in place, I really like it.",4
17697,Not for me! To goopy and thick for the volume I want-,2
17698,"Everyone loved these lighted bows, especially at the office Christmas party.  One wasn't working so I gave it 4 stars.",4
17699,Can't see that it is any help for my hair. Won't reorder.,3
17700,Great little product with mirror included makes it very handy for touch ups on-the-go,4
17701,"So Far So Good.  A little messy, but works well for my needs.",5
17702,"If you have issues with breaking/shredding floss, you might want to get the original version that's in the white plastic container.",3
17703,im trying to find a massage oil an old friend introduced me to but it was none of these.,3
17704,Superb!! Ordered these for the Mrs. and she loves them!!!,4
17705,It was everything I wanted. Very pretty looked like a heart and just like the picture. BUT IT BROKE WITHIN THE FIRST MONTH!!!,1
17706,"Perfect size, super noticeable. Easy to put in if you know what you're doing.",5
17707,I sweat a lot during the summer. This works pretty well. Its not perfect but better than the others out there (non prescription),4
17708,I purchased Chanel Antaeus Bath and shower Gel.  The process was quick and easy and I received the product when promised.,5
17709,Good hair product. I'm sure I will see the positive results soon.,4
17710,"They were great for a while, but came apart and could not get them to stay together.",2
17711,"Very pleasent sent lm getting a lot of hugs, not that l didn't get before, but now l notice them more.",4
17712,"Great price, hard to get off  and on the base but I have never changed the head before this",3
17713,Harder to use than expected and not impressed with results.  Would not buy again.,3
17714,"Good quality for the price, I am happy so far and will buy again when needed.",4
17715,Enjoyed the product. Works Great for what I wanted it for. I would recommend to someone else if I was asked.,5
17716,They seem to work well my father uses them and doesn't complain.,4
17717,"They did exactly what I bought them for, no complaints.",4
17718,"Great bag, good quality, and great price!  What more could you want?",5
17719,The brush head broke off 3 brushes after a few applications . Very poor quality . The bag was very nice .,1
17720,"It is good, I have used this and have gotten okay results.",4
17721,"thank you for my purchase came in earlier than expected, and work well.",4
17722,It has to be on for at least4-6 hours to get the wax at perfect temperature. The wax that comes with it isn't all that great.,3
17723,Color is way off. I bought dark brown but it came brown-red!,1
17724,love the Sensual aroma therapy.  The scent Currant Vanilla.  Best scent ever.,5
17725,I bought it because it said it was long lasting. Isn't long lasting.,3
17726,I love this product. Whenever I use it the pain is gone almost immediately.  And the fact that it's all natural is even better.,4
17727,"product works well, but can really dry out the skin.  A little practice, and it does the job",4
17728,"Best. Trimmer. Ever.

Nothing is perfect, but this gives us an idea of the perfect trimmer. Have at it!",5
17729,Recommended by my dentist.  It has held up for a couple of years now.,4
17730,this things pinch and hurt the heck out of my nose,1
17731,"Good unit but we apparently wanted ""Hard Wax""  So we still use this warmer just with a different wax.",4
17732,"Very useful altough not as effective as I was expecting, it's kinda hard for it to catch shorter hair.",4
17733,"It is a great hand cream, I would not use it on my face, -",4
17734,"that would be great if it could contain more water
i am worrying about that whether it will make a big gap between my teeth and gum...",4
17735,"The lady monkey works wonders,, but the other breast cream wasn't to effective.",4
17736,Didn't smell super waxy/honey like the yellow wax.  A great Buy!,4
17737,Returning as it NEVER rotated!!!  I'm trying to figure it when I realized the damn thing will never turn.  Waste of my time!,1
17738,Works fantastic  but it is a little bit greasy youll notice it on your cell phone,4
17739,"NOT body spray!!! It's an oil for massage, wanted the same as my lotion to be in a nice mist...",2
17740,"These glasses arrived to me with only one protective lens. Guess u get what u pay
 for.",1
17741,My daughter and I use it and our skin and hair are radiant!  I recommend the product!,5
17742,This color goes on bright red not maroon like the packaging looks.,1
17743,fantastic! works great and will save me money in the long run!,5
17744,"works good, my old one was making a lot of noise and wasn't doing a very good job.  the new one works fine.",5
17745,Arrival was faster than expected. A brush was already broken before I got to use. Other than that I'm satisfied especially for the price .,4
17746,My wife loves how this stuff makes me smell.  It lathers up well and is easy to apply and rinse.,5
17747,Beautiful and as pictured. Wore it one time and it broke. Threw it away. I love owls this was poor quality.,1
17748,Great addition to her key ring and just what she wanted. Fast shipping as well. Thanks!!,5
17749,worked exactly has promised. The price will keep me purchasing this over and over!,5
17750,"Works great, even after 3 years. doesn't eat up too much battery power as long as you take out the batteries after every use.",4
17751,My grand daughter used it and her friends just love it,5
17752,dont think its worth the price. feels liek normal cotton socks for 7.99,3
17753,this comes in handy to help cover some of my greys been using it for yrs and works great everytime,5
17754,Successful in keeping ace bandage in place on leg when applied along top edge.,4
17755,Does what it says.  Have saved my broken nailes until they can grow out.  Comes off easily withpure acetone nail polish remover.,4
17756,Wife finds that these bulbs do not provide sufficient light.,2
17757,Needed them badly so I bought them. Too bad about the high price though. They must have come from the moon.,4
17758,Previous WP finally ran out of pressure; this version works much more efficiently but seems to be louder than predecessor,4
17759,"So far, hair appears clean, has not changed color, and is not falling out any faster.",4
17760,"As a Boeing lover, this was an obvious choice.",5
17761,Love the product smells great don't know completely if pheromones work on me as of yet but still pleasant to smell,4
17762,Needed something to clean my clippers with.  This is okay.  The bristles will start to wear down after some time.,4
17763,This product is amazing!  IT soaks right in and really makes a difference in my skin.  I will definitely keep using it.,5
17764,"Nice weight, finish and design. Brush fits, razor fits. Best of all it looks fancy. Very happy.",5
17765,Read the description carefully.....it doesnt come in black as shown.  Apparently they pick the color.  I specifically wanted black and I ended up getting blue,3
17766,I love it. I wore it immediately after receiving it in the mail.,5
17767,"USED TO BE THE BEST. NOW IT'S THE WORST.
WHEN I PULL IT BETWEEN MY TEETH IT SHREDS!!",1
17768,This is just alcohol. Its bad for your skin and doesnt work at all to keep my makeup on longer. Very disappointed.,2
17769,Was very pleased with this scarf length was great and material is light . Great for spring and fall seasons.,4
17770,This is not cold pressed which is important so I sent it back,1
17771,"If added more brush-head , i think it is better.",4
17772,TOO SHORT FOR ME BUT MY 15 year old loves them,5
17773,It is a pretty soap but not fragrant at all. I think it is over priced and I will not purchase again,3
17774,"I easy to use, works well. Wish I knew how long it will diffuse. Like the auto turn off.",4
17775,"If I got the top on, couldn't get the bottom on, & vise versa.",3
17776,We haven't used the WaterPik in years. Finally came back to the best there is for keeping your teeth and gums healthy!,5
17777,"Did not like it at all. A big waste of money, it's already broken.",1
17778,"Love these toothbrushes, both my boys have one. I gave four stars because the replacement heads are really expensive",4
17779,Pretty good quality. I like using this for flossing.,4
17780,"Helps me breath easier, clears up sinus area. Yes, I will purchase this product again.",4
17781,"I still prefer my regular curling iron, although this is fine for a quick touch up.",3
17782,Awesome. I wouldn't use it without the guard but otherwise amazing very powerful and helps cut down on time grooming,4
17783,It irritates the skin! It also has an ugly tint and consistency to it as if it were watered down. Traditional powder works best.,1
17784,"didnt realise it was much smaller than I thought. the wood is fine though, it seems to hold well as I use it.",3
17785,"This is the third one I have of the same model. It'd great for its price, specially for my travel kit.",4
17786,"I THINK THIS WORKS WELL, JUST I COULDN'T SMELL IT AS WELL AS THE PINK BOTTLE.",4
17787,"I like Neutrogena products, so I'm quite satisfied with the Sunblock.",4
17788,I do not like it and would like to return it!! How does one do that???,1
17789,Not good for sensitive skin. They nick and cut easily. Never had this much trouble with blades before.,1
17790,Great smell and light-weight. I love that it is light-weight and does not change the effectiveness of other styling products I use after using this.,4
17791,"Not as many as did would be in there, they fade after a day of wear and stick to container.",1
17792,"Really cheap quality brush set.
1. The Bristles felt rough
2. The metal pink fell of the wooden stick in a few days",1
17793,They do NOT hold an edge for very long.  I go through 2 blades per shave with these.,3
17794,It's not smooth going on at all. The original one with out the sunscreen is sooooo much better. Would not buy again.,2
17795,Did not work at all!!! Do not buy better off with biotin the only thing is my hair had less breakage,2
17796,Excellent product and really enjoying to use. The entire mouth feels excellent after each use.,5
17797,I love it. Have always hated to floss. With this I feel like I have flossed after all.,5
17798,didn't seem like it did much. Didnt notice much of a difference. I have dark brown-black hair coloring,1
17799,Made cheaply and does not hold a charge for too long but it does work pretty well.,4
17800,Cute my skin a little bit but still getting used to them. Besides that it's okay.,4
17801,The five year old I bought it for loved it. Her mother thought  it was excellent. Her daughter loved brushing her teeth with it,4
17802,Good product. Like that you use a moisturizer first as not as drying as some products. Should last a long time.,4
17803,I am going to tell my nephew about this.  He'll love it!!,5
17804,They're ok brushes but I just expected softer brushes then I got but you getwhat you pay for they were cheap,3
17805,Of Questionable value but smells good.. Would recommend as a cologne but not as per advertised use to attract woman..,5
17806,"cute, the noise from every step I took bothered my animals ha,  it broke within the first day though.",2
17807,great product!!! came in less then 2 days and is amazingly soft and work well. You can't beat the price!,5
17808,Works great.  Only problem seems that the trimmer doesn't work as well as my old Norelco.,4
17809,It does help in lubricating the blades and getting a smoother shave.,4
17810,This has been my fav for years! They don't make it anymore. Just wished they had the lotion to go with it!!,5
17811,This product arrived to me and there was not one shadow that wasn't damaged or crushed.,1
17812,Everything I needed work great for short hair would buy again,3
17813,"While cute, this is almost impossible to put on and take off without help.",1
17814,Snaps pulled out immediately....upon testing before using with a client... Subpar quality all the way around!,1
17815,Very cute pieces the only thing is that I thought I was getting 20 different pieces not 20 of the same pieces. Its basically ten pieces.,3
17816,"This is a good product.  Now I don't have to blow my hair dry and then use a curling iron, so it saves time.",4
17817,They don't hold an edge for as long as some other blades I've tried.,3
17818,Using these with my Light Stim...I'm not sure if these are authentic UV sunnies... but they work!,4
17819,It works. I use it every night before going to bed as a preventative treatment.,4
17820,I've bought two 100 packs and continue to use them every time I shave. The small packs are great for throwing in a travel bag.,5
17821,Does not melt down and blend into my face product like other wax I have purchased.,2
17822,Very pleased with the urn we purchased for our mom.,3
17823,"The color selection is enormous, but the shadow not quite as glittery as expected and seems like you have to apply quite a few coats for coverage.",3
17824,WAS TOLD THIS WAS GOOD ON BITES AND SYES IT WORKS SO WILL REBUY WHEN I AM OUT EVERYONE WANTS SOME FROM ME ....,4
17825,Ardell have the best lashes ever and you can never go wrong with them.,5
17826,Too large for small kids to use but perfect for adults,3
17827,Smells great but it doesn't work for me. No tightening or color difference after using it awhile. Disappointed!,1
17828,This is a really great lipstick.  It has great pigments and pretty color. I love the wet n wild lipsticks.,5
17829,Feels a little thicker and average store bought wave caps.  Did take a while to receive.,4
17830,Good - works. You can buy other brans that work too that aren't as expensive,4
17831,Got the product fine! At a great price. Rumor is it helps with brittle nail. No luck!,3
17832,This little case fits the oximeter perfectly and it makes it very handy to protect it.  The price was right too!,4
17833,These are awful. There's no instructions. Waste of money!,1
17834,First water flosser I bought. Works as expected although it is a bit noisy. Hope the attachments will last for a while.,4
17835,Good product but way too expensive. If you have an option get it from a local store,3
17836,"My wife uses this exclusively, Sure beats the stuff that breaks off in your mouth.  Good product.",5
17837,Blades ok. But I have found the true Derby and Feather Blades to deliver smoother shave.,2
17838,Save your money if your looking for good highlighters becca cosmetics is the way to go expensive but so worth the money,1
17839,This stand fits my Edwin Jagger DE89LBL perfectly.  The chrome finish is very attractive. I highly recommend this stand.,5
17840,Color is as expected but it smears very easily and ended up all over my face.,2
17841,Good blades at a fraction of the price of the high dollar razors.,4
17842,"I gave it 4 Stars only because I don't know if there is something better out there, but I love it!",4
17843,What else are you going to use to get that nasty stuff out of your tooth spaces? It has saved me a fortune in dental work.,5
17844,"Fake Toni & Guy branding - knockoff item, cheaply made.",1
17845,"I didn't like it, but it seems gentle on my face.  Doesn't smell as natural as some of the other products.",3
17846,"junky won't even cut a cuticle, will continue the search here locally won't buy again not worth returning. no good",1
17847,Not exactly like a dentist's (minus the suction of course! ) very useful tool if you use regularly and properly!,4
17848,Bought this as preventive when it was going around school.  We were all safe,5
17849,The build quality of this product is excellent for the price. Highly recommended!,5
17850,"Sounds like a good ideas, but don't stick very well.",3
17851,Used for many years and have bought a few over the last 15 years- easy to use on multiple hair lengths.,5
17852,Smells nice. Skin feels soft after using this body butter.,4
17853,My daughter has long fine hair and it doesn't brush through as easily as I thought it would,3
17854,"Works ok. Doesn't condition as well as the Fairy Tale brand. But for the cost, you get so much more with Fairy Tale.",3
17855,"What can I say other that it is what I expected to be, and at a good price.",5
17856,"Only good if you stand and tan, otherwise they don't cover your eyes.",2
17857,Very happy with my first time using it my hair was manageable,4
17858,Works very well.  Has to be secured to the wood with double sided tape.  Would benefit from some guidelines to help set it up.,4
17859,Not for small hands with shorter fingers. The thumbs especially kept gliding up onto my nail defeating the purpose since it smudged my polish.,2
17860,Not so good. The neck one causes redness and wrinkles,1
17861,"spring already popped out after using it twice. received Jan 2016. Came apart March 2016.
was after 30 days so couldn't return",1
17862,"scented, shreds, breaks and everything else you hate about floss. Wouldn't recommend to any one at any time. Move along",1
17863,Soft bristle but it falls off all over my face with every use.  I guess for the price i paid it's not shocking.,1
17864,"It is a very high quality material and very stylish and I will 100% recommend, thank you and I love it.",5
17865,the color is great but the lipstick is a little bit dry and hard,3
17866,It did what I expected it to do. It was OK.The shaver did what I expected it to do. I liked it.,4
17867,Tends to overheat so on low only. This seems to be the only wide barrel brush iron available. I would purchase it again.,3
17868,Tongue cleaner is missing and did not get a response.  Works well and my tongue would have enjoyed being cleaned too.,3
17869,"Exactly like described. Nice stone and works well, but I prefer the ""S"" stone.",4
17870,This will work for anyone.  It has setting for the most gentle of mouths and one hard enough to clean the paint off of the wall.  LOL,4
17871,I lost the exact same style mirror and couldn't find a replacement in stores anywhere. Lets see how long I can hold onto this one...,5
17872,"Smell was a concern at first, then you get use to it and like it.",4
17873,This lost one star for the strong and pungent smell it gives. But other than that its ok,4
17874,i liked the product.its good to use. thanks to oral b :) :) i am very happy with the product,3
17875,This is a lovely scarf.  It is a good size and pretty fabric.,5
17876,Its a bit thick and hard to manage but it looks great.  Put on thin layers.,4
17877,When i receive the product the liquid was spilled out of the tube. I sent it back got a refund. To expensive to arrive like that.,1
17878,"Cuts just like a week old Feather blade.  Did feel good to me, the Feather brand blades seemed much sharper.",2
17879,"I purchased this for my husband, who always used Norelco. The reviews I read before purchasing were the deciding factor.  He
loves it !",5
17880,Love this Jason product. Smells great and leaves my skin feeling so good.,5
17881,"The 7110X is quiet, comfortable and gives me a close shave. Much better than my old National electric shavers. I rate it Great!",4
17882,Fit well and didn't slip. Has some shimmer but not gaudy. I was very happy with this headband.,5
17883,Strings are a bit flimsy/tear if you tug too hard on them but great Durag,4
17884,Did not work at all. Don't think this product is for real.  I can not recommend it. The price is OK.,1
17885,POWERWASHING MY TEETH IS AWESOME. THIS THING DOES IT WELL.,5
17886,"Became really stretchy and could no longer fit my head, and ripped after a while. The material is very cheap.",2
17887,It's not a good as advertised.  Helped some but no way it last for 30 days apfter application,3
17888,My favorite blades so far. I have tried Feather and a few others. This one is the best so far.,4
17889,"We love this spray!  It lasts longer then expected, smells good, and helps get the poop off!",5
17890,My nails break very easily. This turns my nails yellow. Even nail polish remover wouldn't take it off my nails.,1
17891,Their cute ive bought them before but Ebay & these only come With w flowers each slot/: disappointed but cznt do nothing bout it .,1
17892,"good stuff, the smell isn't amazing, but it works well. I like the Cock Grease in the silver can better.",4

17894,"works much better than expected!!
an upgrade from our last one.
very easy to use and clean.
we use it daily.",5
17895,I use it to help keep menopausal acne at bay. Works.it keeps my skin hydrated and helps it heal. Not drying or irritating..,5
17896,"This is a good home product, which is easy to use. It saves money by  doing it yourself.

I use it regularly.",4
17897,I purchased a 2 pack but one of the two was missing.,1
17898,Items are not as advertised. The product does not look like the picture.,1
17899,Is rust a part of razors. Not in todays understanding.,1
17900,They Only Had About 16 Nose Rings IN The Bag Not 20.,4
17901,My favorite scent for personal care but out is not sold in retail stores anymore. Would order in bulk but cannot justify the marked up price.,4
17902,If stars are not enough; please stop asking for my review. I could just as easily not do any of it and just delete your emails.,4
17903,Works perfect for doing manicures but it is stinky...just an fyi,5
17904,It's pricey but it works! I'm a bigger girl and my rump can get funky but this keeps it smelling like nothing at all.,5
17905,"Shaver is very quiet, removes beard close to the skin, is easily cleaned, and the trimmer does well on sideburns.",4
17906,"In my opinion any product by Decleor is going to improve your skin!!
High end luxury skin care at a good price.",5
17907,for a person who doesnt shave before now this is great,4
17908,I would give 5 stars but the item was expected on 1/7/15 and arrived a week later. Otherwise a great blush for medium brown skin.,4
17909,Received before expected. To thick for my nose but I should have known that. I'm satisied with what I paid for though.,4

17914,"Good material. Fits good, wish I had bigger size, and the color in pack wasn't purple like i wanted.",3
17915,works really well for about 2 weeks.  I would continue to use it but the pricing is high for that length of time.,4
17916,The formula is absolutely amazing! Cleared up my breakout immediately!!,5
17917,"Now a a good buy. Not sturdy, made poorly and not a lot of space",2
17918,"It's o.k, but not worth the price, wouldn't purchase it again.",2
17919,"I've used Epsom salts for baths for years, but this is next level detox.",5
17920,Ok.  But I thought I was getting the black ones.,3
17921,"Looks nice and well made, no issues with shipping and did not bend.",5
17922,"Hard to get used to and to operate, and I'm not sure it does the job I bought it for.",3
17923,My wife uses this and loves it. Enough to buy them in bulk for sure. Smells great and makes your skin feel wonderful.,5

17928,Tried all of the other solutions and this one works the best.,4
17929,"This is a great ""summer"" moisturizer. Just love it",4
17930,Gems and Rhinestones in the individual compartments make it so easy to use. Colors are vivid and it has a good assortment.,4
17931,Need smaller size shaft.  What is the smallest you have?,3
17932,I read that this stuff is great for more than moisturizing.  truth be told it is....try it you will like it!!,5
17933,No results so far.  Maybe it takes longer to work.,3
17934,"not crazy about the product. always been a Bareminerals girl, thought I would try something new...it was just not the same",3
17935,They broke in 2 days I expected some durability but eh,2
17936,It's nice but too big for the piercing. I used it for my Tragus and it was just too big & didn't look right,2
17937,Came in early. But gauge was way to small. Not with it.,1
17938,"The color is beautiful, but it clumps on my lips a lot and doesn't last long. Not really worth it.",2
17939,Good product. It does what it is supposed to do.,4
17940,"they are great and useful, I gave my mom a pair and she is so thankful about them.",5
17941,"was holding out on buying one of these but finally bought one.  very nice quality and really makes ""man scaping"" easy.",5
17942,Sorta makes you wish you bought better blades to start with. Don't risk it.,2
17943,I like the Rose petal but my first choice is the lavender. Any of the soaps you get from here are great though.,4
17944,I didn't receive my item (past 1 month already).,1
17945,Very disappointed! Need to look into returning this item. Motor is very weak!,1
17946,They have gone crazy with the price on this product. Best buy is at Walmart for around $5 and occasionally it goes on sale.,3
17947,I love it and I have been purchasing it for a couple years. You won't be disappointed if you decide to purchase these.,4
17948,I love the silky smooth feeling this powder leaves me with after each shower!  It has a pleasing smell too!,5
17949,Didn't get the item pictured it was just a cheap vinyl cape with no raised sides to catch the hair,1
17950,Love the product because it is a great product that gently softens your skin.  Company is slow to ship.,1
17951,I HAVE BOUGHT THIS ITEM OVER AND OVER AGAIN I LOVE IT,5
17952,They are the cartridges to clean the Brun shaver. Work same as the store bought.,5
17953,"It was cheap, there was no irritation and it worked. Nothing spectacular about it, but it does the job for a low price.",4
17954,Does not work well for fine hair like children's hair,4
17955,"Can't beat the price. I don't have any other blades to compare these to, but they have performed well so far",4
17956,Helps conceal balding and grown out roots.  Good black color.  Expensive but worth it!,4
17957,"This is just what my dentist wanted me to use.

Good price but found cheaper in target on sale.
Oh well...should have researched more!",4
17958,I love the style. It was a bit shorter than I was hoping for. Definitely a choker but adorable nonetheless.,4
17959,"Love it, seems to stretched out, cant seem to find it in my house.",4
17960,It left white residue. Sometimes it lived up to its name. But I sweat a lot so I may be the exception.,3
17961,Product does not trim nose hairs and is not sharp!,1
17962,I was very pleased witht eh Royal Almond Bath & Shower Gel.  The packaging was very secure.,4
17963,Loved the moisturizers. Hated the pumpkin mask and the toner.,4
17964,Sleep cap was too small to fit over my hair without crushing it,2
17965,Good brushes for the price.  My daughter really likes them.,4
17966,"Good performance, a new experience for me. Almost as good as an electric brush. However it does leak and drip water in the wrong places.",4
17967,"Love this stuff. It is like the cure all for what ails you.
Infections and pervebtirive nothing is better. Bravo",5
17968,"this shaver is not good for the price.
I would rather spend more next time and get a better brand.",1

17970,worth the price....i am ticked that an opinion needs this much trouble  this is the last rating I`ll make. shove it,4
17971,This product irritated my skin. I felt a burning sensation and broke out almost every time after application.,2
17972,UNFORTUNATELY MY SKIN DID NOT DO WELL AND I HAD TO RETURN THE ITEM FOR REDNESS  THAT HAPPENED,2
17973,Not the best quality and we could not get a good fit,3
17974,I gave these as Christmas gift to my co-workers.  They all really love the functionality.,5
17975,Very cheaply made and had no power. I realize it was inexpensive but disappointed due to product description stating the opposite.,1
17976,"Love this brand! Quality....use for everything! Scent, toner, bathing, face, body splash refresher!  Thank you",4
17977,"great hold, just make sure you let the glue dry completely",4
17978,A wonderful old-time spicy fragrance reminiscent of the barber shops from my youth. It's very soothing for my post-shave face and at a terrific price.,5
17979,Haven't used it yet but it looks to be what I need.,3
17980,My dentist introduced me to these wonder picks. They make a difference in the amount of plaque that accumulates. Great product.,5

17982,Lovely soft fabric and love the versatility of the design.,4
17983,The shampoo and conditioner both work very well. My hair feels softer and looks fuller.  I'm very happy with it,5
17984,Great relaxing and detoxing bath!  Try it and you will be hooked!,5
17985,"Takes a bit of blasting to get coverage, and feels a bit ""dry,""  but a solid hold over until next treatment.",4
17986,My wife says this works well.  So far she hasn't had any problems with it.  The length gauge seems a little loose.,4
17987,Description was for a pack of 3 and only 1 tube arrived.  Currently attempting to get this corrected.  Will update if resolved.,1
17988,Used religiously until it was gone and didn't notice any difference at all in coloring. Very disappointed. This product is NOT inexpensive.,1
17989,This is my third philishave. The last one is still working perfect after 5 years. This one is a step better with the new 3 ring design,4
17990,I've been using this serum for a month and my skin looks bright and soft. This one is a keeper.,4
17991,Good even overall coverage. One of the better self tanners I've used. Love knowing the ingredients are safe.  Color lasts about 3-4 days.,4
17992,Lasted three months.  The stop flow button got stuck and blocked the water flow.  Pretty disappointing.,2
17993,The only issue is there aren't replacement main flosser tubes included.  It has more attachments than necessary for most folks.,4
17994,i bought this in august 2014.it's already broken December 2014,1
17995,I bought this razor in July.  It's August and it stopped working.  That is totally unacceptable and it can't be returned.,1
17996,Absolutely love Mad Hippie....it works as well as tretinoin but not as harsh. Wonderful stuff for keeping skin and pores clear and smooth.,5
17997,Terrible quality.  No stop mechanism with approaching full upright positioning; the piston housing just comes loose and requires someone to manually reinsert the piston bar.,1
17998,This oil is only good however if it were organic it would be great,4
17999,"Does what it promises at a reasonable price. I strongly endorse and recommend to family and friends. My dentist substantiates the manufacturers claim.,",5
18000,They tend to fall out easily. I will try again as toddlers hair gets thicker. Thank you!,3

18002,"It's awesome, my daughter has braces and it works wonders for those hard to reach places!!",4
18003,I got the oil of olay for Christmas presents. I was given some last christmas and really liked it. It was soft and creamy.,5
18004,"I bought it for my family and they loved it. However, some of the tips were useless to me.",4
18005,Bought this as a gift and so far so good.  My mother is enjoying this product.  She said it has great pressure and works well.,4
18006,Not sure if these made any difference in my breath but they went down well when swallowed.,4
18007,Perfect color match works amazing use multiple times and not falling apart great stretch,5
18008,"Small bottle, which does not last very long, but it works great.",4
18009,I absolutely love this perfume and I am so excited I found a place to keep purchasing it :) :),5
18010,"bought it with the purpose of stamping, but the effect was disappointing - wouldn't buy or recommend",1
18011,They are good but not the best quality but if careful it can last very long,4
18012,Like the Anna wig what a waste of money.  It was way too small,1
18013,"Love it!  Scent is refreshing not over powering. Also, the 3 in 1 is great for traveling.",5
18014,I have to receive the brushes. Perhaps you can check on this.,1

18016,Everything as described and very fair price with all contents new and perfect. Already makes a difference how my mouth feels!,5
18017,Saves me from having to floss.  You can feel the waterpik working its magic as you use it.,5
18018,"It's a good cream for normal skin, but it lacks enough moisture for dry skin, like mine ( during winter).",4
18019,"bad quality dead completely after two months , not recommended , bad experience
Don't buy this product and go for better",1
18020,Gives a nice texture to my hair. I use in place of conditioner after I shampoo.,4
18021,"Purchased this for my in-laws. They could not find it anywhere else. Pricey, but it should last them forever!",4
18022,This item has an expiration date of next month. So don't buy it unless you can finish it in a month.,1
18023,Hard to wrap my hair around it.  Probably because hair is thin and fine.,3
18024,you will never find better blades for less money than these! awesome,5
18025,Great deal and leaves my kids smelling awesome!  I bought a box of them years ago and we still have some left!!!,5
18026,Over all this is a ok set for the price. They eye shadow brush was a bit cheap and fell apart right away.,3
18027,Love the feel. Don't know how natural is but looks great,4
18028,i wish ther is less than one star to give u b/c the item is toooooo small,1
18029,Does not work its just another universal case just as someone else said you have to remove it from case to use camera,1
18030,"These were a little difficult to apply and difficult to take off.  They did work, but not as dramatically as the picture shows.",3
18031,"It does a good job.  I am not a fan of the wand and the tubing, but other than it's great.",4
18032,My wife and are are very pleased with this product.,4
18033,Thank you for making this tool available to Amazon customers.  Worked well.,3

18035,Words well but the odor can be a bit much.,4
18036,"I use these and they are just fine.  Not too sharp, not dull.  Just fine.",4
18037,"it doesn't give me anything better or worse.
my skin stays same whether I put it on or not.
waste of money I think,.",2
18038,works so good! just keep it clean all the time,5
18039,"The scent was lighter than I hoped. Pleasant, but not at all woodsy.",3
18040,What a deal thank you. I am very pleased with this product- excellent for healing burns and baby diaper rash.,5
18041,It works as well as my other air brush for drying  but the tangle fee does not work very well.,3
18042,My fault actually. I tried the wrong AC voltage amplitude on the machine and it immediately short circuited so I don't know if it works.,3
18043,This one was different than the last one I had.  I thought I ordered the one that says Hydrate Enhance Protect.  That had much better coverage.,3
18044,Love this - recommended by my dentist and it is exactly what I need for the periodontic work I have had,5
18045,Had to return due to flimsy quality.  The top did not fit well on the bowl.  Seems like cheap quality. Made in Taiwan...figures.,1
18046,A good deal love this product arrived on time package great,5
18047,I bought the multi sized pearls. They are PERFECT for my daughters graduation mani. SUPER fast shipper.,5
18048,"the product is good quality, just taking too long to get it, it takes exactly two months.",3
18049,"Used all over in Europe for my thick hair, did not have to convert only use an adapter for the plug.",5
18050,"I""m using the cleaning solution for my Philips Norelco 1280X rotary shaver.  It does a great job in the Norelco automatic jet cleaning system.",4
18051,I use this thing every night and I love it. Everyone should use one of these. Spend less time at the dentist and get one.,5
18052,Did not get hot enough for my thick hair. I have it to my mother who has a little but finer hair and it works ok.,2
18053,"Fast absorbing, but don't know if it's working, yet.",3
18054,This would be better if it were waterproof. Daughter didn't read the directions and ruined it.,3
18055,Love this product. You can actually see results in helping skin look better. This is my third jar and will keep purchasing it!,5
18056,All the gem keep falling out . I haven't wore one because the gems fell out in about 10 of them.,1
18057,Don't waste your money on this product.  They don't work at all.  Just by the GUM brand threaders - they are fine.,1
18058,The wax is weak and takes a while to heat up. Also the product was damaged and the vendor never contacted me. Would not recommend.,1
18059,"In general I like this floss. Works well and has a great flavor, but breaks too often.",4
18060,"I've only been using it for a month, but it works great, is much quieter than my old razor, and does a descent job.",4
18061,Didn't see any results and it stained towels.  Would not buy again.,2
18062,"Good, easy to apply on skin and smells great too but its TOO OILY..",3
18063,I love this product!  It smells great and leaves my face very soft,5
18064,The product works but for the first few moments after application there is a burning sensation on the lips.,2
18065,Seems like it covers the greys - first time using this brand. My black haired friend swears by it!,4
18066,content good protection BUT container is so slippery literally cannot grip it so sprays wildly....too bad as contents work,1
18067,bottle size is deceivingly small... looks much larger in the picture,2
18068,"Very nice appearance, heavy gauge material, cushioned base to prevent scratches on counter tops. Overall very satisfied.",5
18069,I love this lip gloss it is amazing it stays on for a long time. I will defenantly buy it again.,5
18070,It does a decent job flushing in between your teeth. It has a difficult time shutting off the water with the button on the wand.,3
18071,These work really well. I only wish they were more durable.,4
18072,"CHEAP, THIN, NO BOTTOM SUPPORT. FIRST 3 BOOKS PUT IN IT BUSTED THE WHOLE BOTTOM SEAM OUT. KEEP YOUR MONEY@!",1
18073,It doesn't work! How do I send it back,1
18074,Helped a bit but not nearly as good as the product I was using before which has now been discontinued.,2
18075,"I would have liked to get a better review, but all I received when the package arrived at my home was an empty package. Extremely disappointed.",1
18076,"They're super easy to get in, and with no pain. I'm definitely going to buy these again.",5
18077,Smells like toilet freshener. I use it in the trash can.,1
18078,Less shaddy would of been nice and a few feathers and a few of big bows to have a verity,4
18079,"The adhesive works great, the product bottle is different from the picture.",4
18080,"I just received this at the beginning of November, and it's already not working properly. Definitely go with a different brand.",2
18081,"Useless, don't waste your money on this goop.",1
18082,"No result, nothing! Do not recommend this to anyone",1
18083,The enabler does not allow the key to be fully inserted into the lock.  We can not unlock our doors when the enabler is installed!,1
18084,"It does what its suppose to, comes in a great tamper proof package like youd see in stores and gets the job done.",5
18085,The wax did not suit me. My skin comes out and the portions become complete red. It looks horrible when I am dome with waxing.,1
18086,"The right price, the right quality as described, delivered on time. No ""surprises.""",5
18087,"They are cheating. The price is for only one bottle, but show 3 bottle together.",1
18088,Did not work for people that have large chest. Material is very flimsy and easy to break. Would not recommend.,1
18089,Have used this clay pretty often since my purchase. Works as intended. Make sure to use a thin layer not to irritate more sensitive skin.,4
18090,Perfect for a trial size and for beginners! Great product it levels it self and makes for a smooth application.,5
18091,It was what I expected - good quality with various attachments...highly recommend this.  Easy to operate and works well.  Thank you!,4
18092,It's not a foldable umbrella style hairdresser cape. it's just a peace of sheet with velcro.,1
18093,The Price Is Great and the brushes seem to be in very good quality and they are very pretty looking,4
18094,This is petroleum based but it works great on baby's bottom during rashesZ,5
18095,Good blush but not quite color I was looking for but I still use it.,3
18096,"I have been using it for 3 years, it works still great, and good power durability and easily to handle",5
18097,I love this stand. Holds my brush and razor perfectly. Looks great and is very solid.,5
18098,Bought these for the kids' Christmas present. Not too happy with them. The corner holders are constantly slipping off. Doesn't feel very stable.,1
18099,Loved it. Just wish the hearts were a little bigger and the shipping was faster.,4
18100,worked well for my grandson who is effected by chlorine. He did not itch or scratch when using this,5
18101,good product but small container and takes awhile for it to show gingival improvement,4
18102,It's cute on but discolored pretty quickly after a few use. It was also a little longer that I thought so it hang  bit weird,3
18103,Never got to try it.  The bottle arrived empty.,2
18104,These go with everything! They are so good. Only down issue is they aren't waterproof. :-) :-) :-),5
18105,"Super compact, does the job well. The gaurd is easy to move and adjust to the length you like. Easy to hold.",5
18106,"My family and I have used this shampoo and love it the conditioner is great also. I love Le Grande Francisco
products!!",5
18107,"This spray leave the hair sticky and weigh it down, won't absorb at all. Very Disappointed....",1
18108,"Really pretty color, but beware the color really stains your lips to the point where its almost impossible to take off!",4
18109,non-burning? then why does my child scream when i put it on?,1
18110,love this lipstick. I probably would go with another color but the product itself is great. Stays on all day,4
18111,"It changed color to black in an instant, do not buy.",3
18112,The color wasn't as pretty as I thought it was going to be.  Its a little too orange for me.,3
18113,"Have been very well satisfied with the razor the charge holds well and the shavig results have been well, would recommend the purchas.",4
18114,Great Deal!  Works great and so easy to use!,5
18115,broken mirrors though packaging was fine--not able to use them,1
18116,If you have braces this will not substitute in any way for flossing,3
18117,Only been using this product for a couple of weeks and see a big difference.  I have to look long and hard for the dark spots.,4
18118,Don't waste your money. Can't even smell after putting it on. Not even a 1 star.,1
18119,The shampoo and conditioner both work very well. My hair feels softer and looks fuller.  I'm very happy with it,5
18120,"Very quite and smooth.

Close shave without pressure and excellent recharge time.

Great value.",4
18121,Doesn't have much power and you have to replace the batteries a lot,3
18122,Works quite well with my Braun Series 7 Pulsonic Shaver. Definitely reduces shaver 'drag' and doesn't contaminate the Braun Series 7 alcohol-based cleaning solution.,4
18123,Easy to rub on you face or arms etc.  But it forms a tight layer on your skin that made me sweat too much,2
18124,Received it and opened it up and it was maybe half full. Wasn't pleased,1
18125,they stink but I like em it took them forever to get here but they made it thanks again for them,4
18126,"Pretty.  Steady.  When roll is almost empty, it tends to come off while spinning.",4
18127,This works OK. It would have worked better if it was not so flat headed and had some tooth.,3
18128,Great product I have uses for years. It is effective without shredding my face. Easy to use. I recommend it.,5
18129,"It....... Actually..... Works...... So happy :)
But beware, you will probably need to use a moisturizer along with this cream",5
18130,When I received this product the wax was old and not harden. I returned it immediately!,1
18131,"product is fine but packaging looked very old and their was a dent on the tube, as if it was squeezed.",4
18132,"Used it before, no change. IT'S expensive!9",5
18133,"shipped quickly and packaged well, just as described, would recommend to buyers who would like to practice nail art or hand massage",5
18134,hated it. The color looks like I am being laid out-LOL,2
18135,Arrived on time. Look great. Will update when I use them,5
18136,Its good so far but I still need like three more weeks to see a big difference on my face.,4
18137,Every year we vacation on a lake and the kids love to wash their hair in the lake.  This shampoo and conditioner is perfect!!,5
18138,"New item, fast shipper, but returned item due to it does not give as close a shave as it should.",3
18139,"After a month of using this product my hair fell out in patches, it made my hair brittle and after stop using I still have falling hair.",1
18140,The lids suction your eyeballs and the pink color makes it very bright.  I don't feel like Im protecting my eyes much.,1
18141,I got the delivery on time but some of the eye shadows were broken in the case.,2
18142,Excellent doctors recommended for my 93 year old dad. Worked wonders on his hands.,5
18143,Nice blush. The color is a pink/coral. It is not as sheer as I was hoping for. Great seller!,3
18144,We ended up with pink ones. They suck. They actually  intensify the light ...,1
18145,AMAZING brushes for the price they are at it is great the brushes themselves are a bit flimsy but they are very great and professional looking,4
18146,"Doesn't work and please do not use this product on any sensitive areas especially your face, once applied it burns like crazy",1
18147,Packaging getting smaller and smaller these days for same prices.  Yikes.  Product still works great.,4

18149,This product is absolutely amazing. I love it!!!,5
18150,I bought this hoping that it would add shine and body to my hair.  It has worked exactly as advertised.,5
18151,Needs to have more wax and not as dry as it is,1
18152,Color does not look like picture. Was hoping for a red tone. But it is brown looking.,3
18153,"I enjoyed using this product, back to eating icecream with no pain.#gotitfree",4
18154,I won't buy it again. I am spoiled with Dr. Bronners.,1
18155,Good but do not use. Other dental devices more convenient.,4
18156,This is such a great set to just try the different oil. Really relaxing and the scents are amazing. Had a wonderful time with them!,4
18157,Wonderful!!!!!  A fab buy!!,5
18158,Sent a white pair instead of mint color shown. Glove works fine but would have not purchased white.,2
18159,This product does what it states with efficiency. The material does not shred and glides between tight spaces... The best of its kind!!,5
18160,"expire date is too close, since this medicine should taken for a long time it's from worth to be sent with closely expiration date",4
18161,Great product! I love it. I received many compliments about my skin.,4
18162,"Didn't like the scent, kinda granny perfume.  Didn't get me dark either.",1

18164,Purchased for my husband.  He needed a new cleaning brush for his razor.  He says it works great.,4
18165,Not really sure if it has helped with skin irritation or not. Will need to use more than two weeks to give a firm response.,3
18166,Does an ideal job scrubbing teeth and removing plaque and stains from your teeth. Highly recommend.,5
18167,Would prefer the cordless re-chargable. But does the work anyway.,3

18172,Do not ordered this lifting Anti-Collagen Eye Patch with Bio-Gold and Hyaluronic because it  DONOT work.please do not waste your money.,1
18173,Works well but the cap came broken. I managed to crazy glue it back together. Amazingly the liquid didn't leak out.,4

18175,been using it for many years now. gets the job done.,5
18176,Love it! Great product! I will purchase again !,5
18177,This is horrible. That's all I have to say. It ruined one of my wigs. And it's non-returnable.,1
18178,Great to have sharp new Blades.  No more long shaves to clean up the face! I should do this more often.,5
18179,kept popping open when turning in the lock.  I had to drill a hole and put a small bolt thru it to make it work.,1
18180,"I've used this product for a number of years now, I love it",5
18181,I only tried it once and it did not thin the polish - maybe it was too late for this polish.,3
18182,"This product cam timely and in new condition.  I thought it would come with the application syringe and medicine, but those are by prescription only.",4
18183,"I bought the ""samples"" to see if I like it and did not find the product to be any better than Olay Regenerist.",2
18184,I got these as gifts. They are good for the price. Some start out makeup brushes from my daughter and neices.,4
18185,They hurt a tiny bit but I love how they look.,4
18186,can't use it no drawstring to keep the soap inside i won't be ordering from them again.,1
18187,"Tugged like crazy, wish they had been better, but I am feather spoiled.",2
18188,Absolutely fantastic quality - smells and feels great. I mostly use it to soothe my facial skin.,5
18189,It was what I expected - good quality with various attachments...highly recommend this.  Easy to operate and works well.  Thank you!,4
18190,This lipstick is true to color. The lipstick is very drying,3
18191,"Bat-wings be gone! I've got the freshest, driest balls in town. No more awkward walking or standing for this guy!",4
18192,"IReach Dental Floss
-I thought the dental tape would be wider,however, it is much better than floss as floss tears very easily.",4
18193,"Absorbs the sweat, but hair still gets very wet.",2
18194,Lighter duty clippers that are great for snipping off hang nails.,5
18195,"It is adequate, but not as good as the very old model I had but lost.  Not very powerful, slower, acting.",3
18196,"This thing is junk, don't waste your money.  It barely heats up, doesn't curl AT ALL & will pinch your eyelid.",1
18197,"It probably does help a bit with mattifying, but it's not very moisturizing.  I personally need more moisturizing than this offers.",3
18198,I found this Electric Razor to be exactly what I was looking for. Very happy with it.  Easy to use and maintain,4
18199,I liked that it was a corded razor.  It seams to have more power than the rechargeable ones on the market.,5
18200,Watery ... No better than other 30+ sunscreens. Would not recommend or buy again,1
18201,"I used Feather razors and thought I could save money.  Compared to Feathers, these suck.  Tug, pull, hurt, etc.",2
18202,Have not used it long enough to determine its efficacy.  Still waiting to see.,3
18203,"Very good, very fond of children, clean brush teeth than before",5
18204,Easy to use and easy to clean. I wasn't afraid to nick myself because of the guard and it provided a really close trim.,5
18205,Works awesome couple of sprays and wait like 10 minutes then your having sex like a porn star,5
18206,"they are very round, loo like mouse ears instead of cat, not what i paid for",2
18207,"This is a real amazing product, I hate crayons and this works so good.... I love it!",5
18208,"Bonds hair well and is easy to remove with sweet orange oil. You can get creative with it too, add hair wherever you like.",4
18209,The back broke off right as soon as I took them out of the package.,1
18210,"It works very good
Easy to maintain and clean
Water container a little bit small

Excellent cleaning, and a refreshing feeling after you are done",4
18211,Terrible product with a weird taste and smell. I couldn't use it more than once. Will never get Rimmel products again.,1
18212,i really like the light fragrance of this powder and the touch of eucalyptus gives a nice cooling effect. it does help me feel cooler thru the day,4
18213,item came in really quick.  a little learning curve when attempting to release hair but once you get used to it it works.,4
18214,Horrible no results from this product. Not worth the money,1
18215,"They don't even glow, and they're a lot less vibrant in color.",1
18216,"like previous view, pads slip on glasses,not a solution",2

18218,Makes my bad hair day look a little more formal.,5
18219,watered down with strong alcohol smell. burned my scalp.. no protective barrier. awful product. save your money,1
18220,Great item! The best trimmer I have own so far. I would recommend this for sure.,5
18221,"The dress was cute. It was short on the sides though, and somewhat small.",3
18222,I only used it once because I got a rash all over my face. I think I was allergic to it. Have not tried it again..,3
18223,the one I have has worked without any issues for over 3 years now... Bought the same model just incase the first one finally kicks the bucket...,4
18224,"Brush head was great while it lasted, wore out real quick for some reason, only had it for a few weeks and it became disfigured",3
18225,they worked for a little while then all the tops of the brushes fell part!,2
18226,Delivered on time.  Item as stated on-line.  Good feature is that it is dual voltage.,4
18227,"The powder is too thick but I just bought different powder, the rest was awesome",4
18228,"it looks like there were some long wefts glued onto the top...
I haven't tried it on yet, but it seems to do well",3
18229,Excellent replacement part! Now the clock is easier to regulate.,5
18230,"That's the appendage attached to one of the rings and mine was chipped.  -1 star
I like the case and it was sharp.",4
18231,Best Deoderant/Antipersparant ever... wish it was actually available in the US and not via import to keep the price down,5
18232,"A little hard to get used to - squirts all over until you get the hang of it, then it's easy.",4
18233,It does provide space in between but its not sturdy enough,3
18234,The color is supposed to be great on light fair skin. Its so pale and hardly shows up. Not the same as in the picture.,1
18235,"I guess ""clean"" smell was defined ""differently"" back then. I didn't like the smell, returned upon opening the box.",1
18236,"Product is not green. I was surprised to find a piece of white jade. It is nice and smooth, regardless and does its intended job.",3
18237,"Cute, but won't stay shut when you wear it.",2
18238,My wife and our two children have sensitive skin. Aquafor is only producy that always works.,4
18239,"Needed some instructions.  Front, back care of wig, etc.",3
18240,I like a lot before why it is so expensive. I bought last time is half price,3
18241,wasn't real clear on size ! Picture made it look like the big bottle . to expensive !,1
18242,"This thing ripped the hair off my head and never did get it smooth.

Plus you can't buy a new blade for it either.",1
18243,"I love it. its small, no cord, and works great!",5
18244,Goes on like silk. Great scent. Really quickly relieves the itching of dry skin. I am over age 50...love this lotion.,5
18245,"Its easy to use , I like it very much .",3
18246,Water reservoir does not completely empty and needs to be wiped out after each use.  Other than that a good device to assist with oral health.,4
18247,"It was expired or water was added. Scent wasn't there for this one. When I purchase it in stores, it was great though!",2
18248,"Didn't come with the colors pictured, but they arrived pretty quickly so...",3

18250,Did not like it. It slips off my head.,1
18251,love hot air dryers and are so hard to find.. however the teeth on this one are a tad longer than I want..but it will have to work,3
18252,Love this stuff not oily or greasy and it holds without being crunchy!!,5
18253,Don't understand all these positive reviews upon which I based purchase.  This is not a standard cape.  It's tiny.  Flimsy.,1
18254,A bit too thick for my hair-makes it feel like straight gel!,3
18255,This is fake. Called the manufacturer. No expiration date on it!,1
18256,Really good deal and good quality. 5 star is given!,5
18257,It wasn't the packaging listed and my liquid latex came solidified...,1
18258,My husband feels that the taste is too pungent and it is causing his gastric problem . He is not ready to take it anymore since he feels bloated,2
18259,Nicely pigmented blends well removed easily great colors for light to deeper complexions. Easy to use little fall out can be used for contour!,4
18260,Did absolutely nothing to detangle my daughter's hair which is thick and curly.,1
18261,"This trimmer started out really well, worked as advertised.
But in 3 months, it completely died out, and it's now unusable.",2
18262,"very bulky, need a lot of space in bathroom. how do you spit if water comes continuously in your mouth",1
18263,I did not like this at all it looked nothing like the picture,3
18264,Necklace broke the first day I received it. Was just sitting playing cards and the charm broke off.,1
18265,"It looks cheap, not at all as on the photo. I just don't like it. Will not order again. A",1
18266,"Ok, took 1 month to get, my fault did not notice coming from China.",3
18267,It works fine but I actually prefer the men's gillette fusion pro glide styler to trim down below.,3
18268,A little large for smaller faces but good quality and does the job.,4
18269,Love the smell and price.  But it left a wax feel.  I gave it away.,3
18270,I liked it.. but just to strong of smell for me,2
18271,It was a little light but it's nice to use to conceal.,4
18272,Gives a lather very quickly with just a little soap.  Cleans well.,5
18273,This item worked twice and then died. Wouldn't even start after I changed out the batteries. Useless. DO NOT BUY.,1
18274,Noisy  and attachments are not as well made as might be. Does a fairly good job. Attachments clog easily and are difficult to clean.,3
18275,Hairdressers enemy! I can go an extra 2-3 weeks without getting grays colored!,5
18276,"I really liked these, I mean for this price they're fantastic...I would recommend them to my friends :)",4
18277,"Replacement sponge tips fragile & costly to replace, yet, useful.",3
18278,We have used a waterpik for years. This one leaks and makes a mess of the bathroom counter.,1
18279,"unfortunately, it does not work for me. have not used it, don't know what to do with it as it is passed return day.",2
18280,Love this product -I have fine hair and this product works great to give body.,5
18281,Did not work for my nails...Sally Hansen nail dry far superior product,1
18282,I've been using it twice a day for one month now and still no results. :(,1
18283,These clippers did not work. Don't waste your money!,1
18284,Kind of weird and stiff. It's good in a pinch but not great for daily use.,3
18285,"Very sharp, work great. The only reason I gave them a four was because they don't have the groove where the fingers rest.",4
18286,The perfect tool for my teenage daughter with braces. She uses it everyday and it makes flossing much much easier.,5
18287,Works great but amber dome came in pieces probably due to packaging.,4
18288,This product is unsealed. I am wondering if this is a trial product.,1
18289,produt ok  a power puff weighs almost nothing  yet i was charged a large shipihng and handling,3
18290,Scissors cut straight line which was exactly what I needed. These are for home use so I can't really say for a beautician.,4
18291,"Pretty comfortable, and protect the eyes as described. The item does its job. Simple as that.",4
18292,Broke the second day I had it. Not worth returning.,1
18293,Doesn't remove build up and makeup very well. Best suited as a light cleanser in the morning. It smells fantastic!,2
18294,Very very hard stick...packaging appeared to be a prototype because cap would not stay on. Smell after putting it on turned.,1
18295,full-color awful wig yet another Chinese company took forever to get it and it was horrible do not buy from this company,1
18296,I must have too soft of skin. It hurts but good with washing pans.,3
18297,"Hard to apply, the color is lighter than expected, and it does not stay on for long time.",1
18298,"as they say "" u get what you pay for "" used it once and it broke",1
18299,"This soap smelled amazing, but I found it drying to the skin and the bar was gone after a week's worth of showers.",2
18300,"Good formula, a little dark for me so I use it as a foundation, LOL!",5
18301,I have tried many other eyelash treatments and besides Latisse this is the best. My lashes grow fast!,5
18302,"Not happy with my latest purchase of this product. I think they changed the formula, would not purchase again.",3
18303,Great body without diminishing shine. No heavy scent. Easy to use. I have limp fine hair and this stuff is magic.,5
18304,I love all the colors but I haven't been able to use some of them because they are stuck to the black backing,3
18305,You can't beat this razor for the price! Gives you a close shave and is very easy to clean up. I highly recommend!,4
18306,"The hose to the hand held is weak, broke off and I can't re-stick the hose back into it.",1
18307,Giving it more time to see the effect on my skin.,3
18308,Nice lotion but doesn't do much for fine lines or wrinkles,3
18309,This model cuts my beard closely and comfortably without needing frequent recharging. The sideburn trimmer works well too. It's a good value for the price.,4
18310,"I like the way it goes on, but does not seem to last as long as their other products.",4
18311,"love these, arrived on time, packaged nicely, & the best part they're re usable, so make your own nail art at home forever!",5
18312,"When you buy razors. You get what you pay for. SO, these shave, and when you do, you lose whiskers.",3
18313,"Smooth shaver, holds charge for 5-6 shaves. No indicator to show how much  battery power remains.",4
18314,Works better than I thought it would for the price!  4 stars bc I wish it were rechargeable instead of requiring batteries,4
18315,"found these for 25 cents per pad, and it's the same grade as the ones used in the hospital where I work...thanks.",4
18316,The lid doesn't fit securely but it still works.,3
18317,"I thought the spray would be more focused, but otherwise, it's a wonderful product that does not rub off or make my hair fell dirty.",4
18318,I like it. I use it nearly every day. It has held up and done what it is supposed to.,4
18319,"Nice little machine, do wonders once you figure our how to position it correctly.",4
18320,This item is ok but was way too expensive for what it is!,3
18321,It was as described. I can also feel a tingling on my skin when I use it.,5
18322,good price for the amount. I love this smell.-cece peace out world the world the world though tough guy hate not love yes,4
18323,It was a nice item but each bar was not individually wrapped therefore they had become stuck together.,4
18324,This pre-shave has been a generational family favorite since forever. And now my son also appreciates Lectric Shave. It's a winner!,5
18325,NO WHERE NEAR AS GOOD AS THE BARE MINERALS. VERY CAKIE.,1
18326,This item arrived by all I got inside was a box with direction no wax strips,1
18327,the adjuster is a little flimsy. you have to be careful when cutting hair.still nice for the money. light in weight,4
18328,not bad.. didn't moisturize as much as i had hoped,3
18329,"Pretty standard exfoliating gloves.  The ones I received were cream colored, not green as pictured.",3
18330,Strips are small and really only suitable for waxing the face.,1
18331,Love it!! It was a little thick so I added a couple drops of acetone and it's perfect now!,4
18332,"Perfect function, and it looks nice, too!  This fits my Edwin Jagger and Perfecto badger just fine.  Highly recommended.",5
18333,"Go everyday blade, comfortable and at least three shaves a blade.",4
18334,Like the product was reccomended by my dentist. Flossing is still required. Another tool to use for fighting tooth decay.,4
18335,This was a gift for my husband. He said it works as well on the job as he expected it to do.,4
18336,"It seems to work well.  I bought it for my husband, and he likes it.",4
18337,Covers the little spots I need to have covered before I recolor my hair.,4
18338,excellent product...good design...nozzle resting plastic clip broke...fixed easily...still works day after day after 3 yrs,4
18339,I swear this was horrible I ordered this for my mom and it was shipped horrible. It was broken and dirty,1
18340,It works great for wrinkles and is very comfortable.  Wish it was easier to clean with out removing some of the sticky,4
18341,"Couldn't be more pleased.  Cool clean shave with mimimum effort,charge lasts a long long time, simple operation, easy clean.",4
18342,"Colors are bright which I like, however the red isn't truly a red would have given it 5 stars if the this wasn't the case.",4
18343,Great extension for the one piece i got. The description said 7 pieces and i only recieves one clip in extension. Not too impressed,1
18344,Sometimes I think that these lipsticks have their people and that I am not one of them,3
18345,"trims nice. the best part is its precision trimmer, gives you a very close trim. worth it.",4
18346,This is for styling. It does blow but not really for a dryer.,4
18347,"One star because it does actually tingle. Other than that, nothing. So disappointed.",1
18348,These are my favorite eye shadows! Box even comes with instructions. Love it!,5
18349,nice heavy weight. Good grip. Bendable  spoon. Very satisfied,4
18350,tried to use promotional code ...would not work! Won't buy if your promotions aren't valid.,1
18351,"All the posts where blood red with different, not matching balls and posts like the pic...worst purchase ever.",1
18352,Can't find a brush that fits the one end.  Old style razor fits though.,2
18353,I use this everyday and love it! Amazon is great!,5
18354,It works very well but occasionally it trips the circuit breaker.,4
18355,VERY GOOD PRODUCT...IT DOES THE JOB FOR MY 8 YEAR OLD GRANDDAUGHTER,5
18356,"Material is lacking in quality and wearability.  Also, garment drooped and did not keep its shape as advertised",1
18357,Easy to carry. Smells great. Feels expensive on the skin. Will buy it again. Will last for at least a couple more trips.,5
18358,"This make-up is amazing, and it does what they say!!",4
18359,Doesn't give a good lather but it moisturizes the skin really well and has a great scent.,4
18360,Kind of disappointing. Does not work nearly as well as the Coppertone Tattoo Guard lotion & much more difficult to cover a large surface area.,3
18361,"OK, not as good coverage as I hoped but use it as a foundation under powder.",3
18362,I use them to clean the oil off my face and seems to work well.,4
18363,"as advertized and wonderful product. does what it said it would, and very well. would recommend it for those who want a good product.",5
18364,I like it though I wish it was a little more powerful.  I really like that it comes withn electronic charger.,4
18365,This product made my face break out terribly. I am 46 and feel like I'm 14 because my face has so much acne now.,1
18366,"It works. (But now I need 18 oops 9 more words)
Be sure to clean the heads before lubricating.
Somewhat costly.",4
18367,"Not 21 inches at all !!!! But it's good quality hair and it manages really well , they sent me off !!!",4
18368,"Pretty color, wish it lasted longer. Have to reapply after eating and drinking",3
18369,Does an excellent job of 'flossing' and is easy to use.  My second Waterpik and the first one lasted a very long time.,5
18370,They need to decrease the size of the product. No one's head is that big,2
18371,"No rating as I couldn't buy in the UK, dissappointed.",1
18372,very pleases with quality and price.  am going to get more as gifts. my christmas will be easy when i get more water picks.,5
18373,Works as described. Doesn't fit my two razors very well.  They rest right on their head.,4

18375,The color is nice but does not stay on long enough and makes my lips very dry.,1
18376,Very small. Very heavy. Not at all what I was looking for. Horrible product,1
18377,Great shampoo for traveling! I use it with Dr. Bronner's leave in conditioner. Works great!,4
18378,it did not work at all i am not happy at all with it it is junk i snore  a lot,2
18379,"Overall a good product.  The replacement heads are pretty steep cost wise.  The head design lets one get into the area around the nostrils quite
well.",4
18380,"Good product, only con is the string broke really fast on it.  Wasn't durable.  Cheap made.",2
18381,"forget floss, with this thing it's amazing what comes out from between your teeth!",5
18382,Only thing they do is leave sticky wax on your skin. I will not buy this product again.,1
18383,A little goes a long way and I like the way this product makes my hair look.,5
18384,"Beautiful presentation, but candles smelled more of sulphur from match then Annick Goutal. This is it, the whole review today",4
18385,I need and love these things.  It helps for about 3-1/2 weeks.  I can finally swoosh again.,5
18386,Would love theorizing as well. Not available at this time.,5
18387,Wasn't what I expected at all. Does not show on my skin at all,2
18388,I plan to buy more colors. Good value for the money.,4
18389,I like the Method Body Washes. The peach is a clean fresh scent that I like but seems just a little bit strong.,4
18390,"This is really cute!  Very good quality and for the price is unbeatable (the magnet is delicate, so you just have to be careful).",5
18391,Very nice product!  Just used them on my daughter's hair and they are great!,5
18392,This brush is very stiff and hard. Even after soaking it for 5 minutes it is still to coarse to use on my skin.,2
18393,Amount smaller then I expected.  Haven't used it that much to really judge what was promised,3
18394,"would not work in my shower, couldn't get it to line up right with the pattern of my shower surround.",1
18395,Smells great and works really well. Replaces expensive cream.,5
18396,It works well but does not trim the hair as short as I'd prefer it to be. It leaves quite lengthy hairs behind.,3
18397,First time I ordered they were great. This shipment looks luke it was on the shelf in a humid area for awhile.,4
18398,It was awesome and then it crapped out. I'm going to try another brand. Just stopping working has been my issue with these trimmers.,1
18399,"They are difficult to use, because they slip around in the mouth unless you hold them in place.",1
18400,Noted that sandalwood was listed as no. 10 in list of 12 ingredients.  Not much essence of sandalwood comes through when showering with it.,2
18401,Not like the picture and my lips got dried out.  Cool color tho.,3
18402,these are silicone which i thought i would like... but they have something in these that irritate my skin around my eyes,1
18403,"Cost me like $3, not bad. Tastes ok I guess, it is just mouthwash and saved me a trip to the store...",4
18404,"you get what you pay for expect I think I paid more when I bought mine, go figure. Great for teenagers or getting started.",3
18405,It didn't fit it was to small my goods got toasted,3
18406,"when on the keychain, the chain easily breaks but can't beat for the price
Have ortho treatment so always need it",4
18407,"It feels like Vaseline, so I returned it for a full refund to Amazon!",1
18408,This is by FAR my favorite lip balm!  I can only find it on Amazon and am just grateful that I can!,5
18409,there are too many attachments.  The main water pic attachment is all I need.  the six other attachments are dust collectors.,4
18410,The rough side is useless.  The loofa side works just as you would expect a loofa to work.,4
18411,Color does not last more than a few minutes on inner lid. Definitely not waterproof. Very disappointed.,2
18412,"First time ordering these, and i have to admit with others these are terrible. it won't give you a smooth shave :(",2
18413,Even I have big space between tooth still to thick to fit. I just bought the other kind from Reach.,3
18414,They are okay they bend which I like and don't break nice string but that breaks easy as I now have to use a rubber band,3
18415,"Great for after shave cream.
Stops razor burn quickly.",5
18416,This cleans and exfoliates nicely...warm water/soap of your choice and it will leave you smooth and refreshed ,4
18417,"Love how you can get so many, and for so cheap. Has made my new shaving life, just that much more great.",4
18418,Item came on time. I like the product but i am not completely satisfied.,3
18419,This trimmer was a complete waste of money. I used it one time and it cut my skin. I will not use it again.,1
18420,Good product and communication! The exfoliation feels great and leaves me feeling clean. I recommend this product.,5
18421,Eucerin is a very good face creme. I really don'tknow what I can say about this except it does a vey nice job.,4
18422,the shape is odd. Doesn't stay still. It is missed aligned.,1
18423,I was u see the impression I was purchasing more then one,3
18424,"great product! only gripe - wish it would run on 220v mains, too",3
18425,The color isn't very dark and doesnt stay on through out the day,2
18426,"It is working, so no complaints so far. It applies very easily and neatly. Glad I was able to find it online.",4
18427,"The button you press to stop water flow broke right away and stayed stuck in, just made this useless otherwise i loved it",2
18428,"Trading on the name of  the original product. Has no odor or ""sting""!  Waste of money!",1
18429,I don't love the cream but I love the powder.,4
18430,"I liked it, feel it was effective and would buy again.",4
18431,"I love Essie and this color is light like sand, just like the name says. A great spring and summer color.",5
18432,Super cute brushes perfect for traveling and very soft ... down side is the bristles started falling off with the first use,3
18433,Leaves a residue... but a firm hold. Use sparingly,3
18434,"I have suffered all my life,,,, this is the only oroduct that works... it is quite gross but it really works",5
18435,pretty color but lipstick came loose from container after 2 uses,3
18436,"Great stand, heavy, good looking and I would buy it again.",4
18437,Seems to work very well.  A little bit of an after use greasy feeling but does not last long.,4
18438,"When I received my Set, I found that the box, one of the eyeshadow, and one of the blush  were broken.",1
18439,"Smells like toothpaste, and is doesn't spay evenly. Otherwise is does the job",4
18440,Packaging getting smaller and smaller these days for same prices.  Yikes.  Product still works great.,4
18441,On the fence about this supplement. Been taking it for almost a month and not sure if I see a real difference.,3
18442,Love it! Live in Arizona and NEED as much moisturizer as I can get.,5
18443,"great product, I use it all the time between coloring.  The actual color is darker",4
18444,This is a great face cream if you like a balance between greasy and not. It's well made; no petroleum. Love it!,5
18445,"Thought it was curved, has two straight blades like any other regular shaver, i will end up using a blade from here on out.",2
18446,These blades get dull after one shave. There are better blades for shaving.,1
18447,"they don't fit it tightly, so I did not want to use to damage the machine.",1
18448,"Not the strongest hold, they fall pretty fast, after day two they start to fall off",3
18449,Daughter was happy with the selections. Faster delivery than expected. Thanks,4
18450,This product is very disappointing.  The suction cups do not stay and the product itself does not stay together.  I am returning for a refund.,1
18451,We have had two battery powered Waterpiks and both  faied after a few years. They also did not have the water pressure that this unit has .,5
18452,Great look and sturdy with a non-slip base.  Could not be happier with it.,5
18453,I like the pens however I am not a fan of the chain for connecting it to something. It frequently becomes unlocked from minor jostling.,3
18454,"I sent this as a gift and have not gotten feedback yet.
i can't really rate it for this reason.",3
18455,They are basically big pieces of colored clear plastic the Gold and silver and black are solid.,3
18456,"This is a really good thing to have if you are busty to help battle lines in your chest, and it really does make a big difference.",4
18457,"strips are a lot thinner than expected that's why I gave it a 4, however, still works for what I need it to",4
18458,"Smells good, but can't say it added any oomph beyond smelling good.",3
18459,"Love this product! Go a shade lighter. Easy to apply, doesn't irritate my scalp like other products, good color coverage for gray.",5
18460,"Favorite since the 1950's still the same quality  AND free shipping, can't beat that!!",5
18461,"Maybe I'm using it incorrectly or something, but I find my regular dental floss much more effective. . . .",2
18462,Product is heavy and does not leave hair silky and shiny. Could have gotten the same results with any styling product bought at the grocery store.,2
18463,"Total waste of money, broke the very first time my daughter tried to use it.",1
18464,"The hair dryer works well but it is not a low noise travel hair dryer, as it was advertised. It is heavy, full-size and noisy .",2
18465,Husband says this really does the trick cleaning his razor.,4
18466,"it broke after first use, was very cheaply made, and also too big, was not as advertised. do not buy",2
18467,"Good price for replacement heads. Hard to find these sometimes at department stores, let alone for a decent price.",4
18468,This product has helped my skin a lot so far.,4
18469,"I really love this product. I use it about a year, and I can see the difference. I recommended it all my friends and families.",5
18470,Better than flossing for flushing out debris from pockets but cannot really entirely replace it. Flossing cleans tartar build up better in between teeth.,3
18471,If care about chemicals in your body products fyi this has parabens in it.  it doesn't lather well so you lose alot of product.,2
18472,Works great and is definitely worth the money. There are cooler designs out there but they cost a lot more. 10/10 would buy again,5
18473,The shipping on this was very fast and customer service was terrific. These towels are very absorbent and well-made. Great for home or travel.,5
18474,They are really tiny and they fall out every night while I sleep.,4
18475,"Can't open the bottle it's sealed so tight.  So, cannot answer until I do.",3
18476,This Doll Is Amazing So Pretty The Hair Length Is Perfect And The Texture Is Awesome She Arrived Safely And Well Package,5
18477,"Great liquid soap with no scent inducing hullicinations.
If your like me and dry out like a raisin after a shower this is the ticket.",4
18478,"This has proven to be an excellent purchase, it shaves incredibly close without irritation. Exactly what I was looking for when I purchased this product.",4
18479,They actually worked a little better than I expected but I was a little disappointed they came from China. :(,5
18480,Didn't generate enough pressure. Felt like I still needed to floss after each use.,1
18481,Nice cheap gift with no thought over it.  I never wash.,2
18482,"I believe this will suffice for placing into small containers with tiny holes in top, to be used in tool boxes.",4
18483,It should be required for everyone to have one. This thing is awesome! This thing gets gunk that floss couldn't.,5
18484,I hate wet n wild lipsticks they look like little kids claires crappy cakey lipstick,1
18485,Holds my brush and razor just fine. Heavy enough that it doesn't want to fall over. Packaging and shipping was more than adequate.,5
18486,good!! ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha hah ah ahah ha ha ha ha h a,5
18487,"Wash your face with this and it leaves your skin feeling especially clean and refreshed. It's an expensive way to wash, a small luxury.",4
18488,They are great but a little big and harder to hide. This is my second order. I use them in special iccasions,4
18489,Works okay for trimming and is lightweight. Size is also good for travel.,3
18490,"Product has changed in past year.  Different color and different scent.  IN fact,  can hardly smell it",1
18491,I'm very disappointed that the results aren't good.  It isn't showing any improvement at all.,1
18492,Great quality razor blades. And buying in bulk has been a HUGE savings!,5
18493,Read the instructions carefully and you won't be displeased! Love it!,4
18494,"Looks good, well built, does the job well.",4
18495,"The owl is absolutely darling and worth the price; however, you may want to purchase a nicer chain.",4
18496,It did not do what it said it would do. Does not stick.,1
18497,I am now convinced that shampoo bars are the best way to go!!,5
18498,"This is a pretty lipstick, but is sweet tasting. If you like that buy it. I didn't care for the scent and flavor.",3
18499,Bought it as a present...doesn't fit a standard Gillette razor,1
18500,This product seems OK  I WILL KNOW MORE IN A MONTH OR SO BUT I SHOULD HAVE RE ORDERED THE FIG OIL IT DID NOT MAKE ME RED.,3
18501,My skin turned bright red wherever I used this product. I've never had a reaction to any other product containing benzoyl peroxide before.,2
18502,Cartridge are fine but Braun System doesn't really work well with the cartridges,4
18503,Returning as it NEVER rotated!!!  I'm trying to figure it when I realized the damn thing will never turn.  Waste of my time!,1
18504,Nice smell and I have way fewer problems with static. Doesn't do the best job of detangling wet hair though.,4
18505,Cleansing properties are above any praise! Suprised by how good an all-organic product can be. Hair feel amazing after use.,5
18506,The unit was for my wife and she says it does a good job and she is VERY satisfied with the product.,4
18507,Easy to use and effective. I keep in the car for quick use as it can be applied without getting your hands slippery.,4
18508,DONT KNOW IF IT WORKS  TUBE IS VERY SMALL AND THE OPENING IS TINY NOT MUCH COMES OUT,2
18509,Bought this for my Mom for Christmas...she used to use this when she was a young girl! Really made her holiday! Thank you!,5
18510,Ordered a confederate rebel flag.and I received a pow mia flag.what the he'll guys.not even.close.,1
18511,Shaves ok on the first shave but grabs your skin..not a close shave for fine hair,2
18512,Very nice -- it's a good value for the amount of product you get.  I like the pump dispenser.  A little goes a long way.,5
18513,"The trim heights seem to be an issue, but I make it work and you become accustom to it.",3
18514,Have to have these for my lipstick. Great for your pocketbook. Little mirror in it. It's great!,5
18515,They leave a sticky mess and don't take any hair! Worthless!,1
18516,"I like hemp oil idea, hence the 2 stars, but the smell is too overpowering and somewhat artificial",2
18517,I use this for vaping. I make all of my own flavoring's and this was at a nice price and was perfect for it's purpose.,5
18518,"It's a great product, effective as a moisturizer/barrier.",4
18519,The feather was a bit smashed but overall product as expected. I ordered 4 more for my friends for our Roaring 20's Party.,3
18520,They are great but get rusted easily. Make sure to change blades very often.,4
18521,"I really love this product!  My skin was so dry and flaky, but now it is as smooth as silk. I will be buying again.",5
18522,Awful design and quality. Don't waste your money.,1
18523,"For the money, these can't be beat.  A dime apiece and I change at least once a week.  Always sharp and comfortable.",4
18524,Used during the cold dry winter and kept hands well moisturized.,4
18525,Very soothing. Love not having to worry about its safety for my little one!,5
18526,"Doesn't completely clear the bumps, but better than northing",3
18527,"nice graphics and gameplay, and if you have a good nvidia (gtx 660 or above) you should turn up high the physx*.

*Borderlands 2",4
18528,color is too bright and sparkly which I didn't expect,2
18529,i do not like pink but good quality item would buy again if i need them so i do like them,3
18530,Great for people with tight gaps between teeth.  Does break though if you pull too hard.,4
18531,"For me this product was clumpy, matte, and tacky and didn't stay on or look as great as the picture...",2
18532,it broke within hours of me putting it on! Very pretty but cheaply made.,1
18533,I really like this massage oil lets me have a lot of fun!!,4
18534,"They were really pretty, I did not use them and bought them as gifts for friends. I think they will be a great starter brush set.",3
18535,It's a scam. You will get charge hundred of dollars once you give your credit card info to these people.,1
18536,Came fast and it works. Ideal for braces it's easy to slip behind them and get inbetween the teeth. Love it,4
18537,This case is SO ME lol! Fits my Iphone 6 plus perfect,5

18539,Saw no difference after using for more than a month!,1
18540,One finger came apart after 2 uses.  Good for folks with long fingers.,3
18541,Was very pleased with them for the price. My daughter was very happy and now she is wanting to order more.,4
18542,Excellent product and exceptional customer service! Quality product at a great value! Customer service exceeded my expectations. Highly recommended!,5
18543,didn't work for me but not the products fault.,3
18544,I have a pixie cut and this holds my style.,4
18545,Hate that the water floss head moves. I have to hold it down with my index fingers and thumbs to position. Can't just use the handle,3
18546,Bars were sort of melted and damaged - they were stuck together and the paper wraps were very hard to remove,3
18547,Did not like the scent but it feels nice and silky on the skin.,3
18548,Takes a bit of practice but works quite well within limitations.,4
18549,"it broke after 2 weeks of use, otherwise it could have been a great product.",2
18550,"This fell apart straight out of the package. The white belly part isn't attatched to anything, let alone glued down.",1
18551,"I like the way this operates, easy to use, I have gum issues and this has improve my dential hygiene visit to the my doctors.",4
18552,I am very pleased with my waterpik.  If I could change anything I would change the pressure just a little.  Easy to store.,4
18553,I goober my feet with this and the cracks feel better overnight.,4
18554,The earring was very flimsy and fell apart very quickly.,2
18555,Works okay but not as natural as it claims. READ ALL INGREDIENTS,3
18556,This shaver goes a long time on a charge. It shaves pretty close but it is sometimes difficult to get the whiskers just under my nose.,4
18557,Its perfect for my husbands existing razor and the badger brush I bought him,5
18558,I'm Black Of Medium Skin Tone And This Works Well As A Very Natural Looking Lip Color For me.,4
18559,I have purchased this product multiple times only to have it break after a short period of use. I would not recommend,1
18560,"These were poorly made and had a distinctive, terrible bad odor.  Believe the adage, you get what you pay for.",1
18561,Not as bright pink as I thought it was going to be.,3
18562,"It burns, but I'm hoping that that means it's working.",3
18563,"This is the fifth Waterpik I purchased. I think the quality getting worse. The noise is so loud, my ears cannot stand.",1
18564,I guess the one and a half inch barrel is meant for longer hair than mine.,3
18565,As someone with sensitive teeth/gums and exposed nerves I need a soft toothbrush. These are not soft. I don't recommend.,2
18566,my son loves his axe sponge.  says it works great and makes him feel so clean,4
18567,I don't think it really works. Any changes since two weeks.,2
18568,These clips make a great addition to my hairdos. Small but great for the effect that I am attempting to achieve.,4
18569,It's ok Not sure if it really works or not. But cool room light,3
18570,Has an onion smell to it! I also bought the tea tree and that one was a lot better!,3
18571,JUST POOR VALUE AND QUALITY. PUT WATER ON YOUR FACE BETTER RESULTS. VERY EXPENSIVE.,1
18572,"Can definitely smell the cedar, however I personally can NOT smell the tobacco but still smells greeeaattt!",4
18573,"This product is gross.  When you spray it, it leaves a small circle and looks so very obvious.  It's going in the trash!",1
18574,It's smaller than I thought but it's a really good fit on the bathroom counter. Very easy to use and cleans thoroughly.,5
18575,i love it but its a bit bigger than i expected and the button fell off rather soon though i suppose i can sew it back on,4
18576,"Really like it, quite small...doesn't last long",3
18577,just started to use it seems to be working okay I need to give it time to work. time will tell,3
18578,Backs are hard to get on and they change colour and go back to clare the red got clare in a week,3
18579,Water pressure even on highest setting is still poor. After 2 min of using waterloo I still used regular floss. Disappointed,2
18580,"Best electric shaver I've ever owned.  Only thing is, it's hard to clean.  But it's still a great shaver.",4
18581,"This exfoliating towel is very big, works great at cleaning the skin and removing dead skin cells, little hard to use in the shower though.",4
18582,Seems to have the desired affect. I have noticed a definite increase in the attention I get. Will buy again.,4
18583,I will be returning this product. Super messy. I'm wondering who paid someone to write all these positive reviews,2
18584,It may take some getting used to but it's drying. It does have staying power.,2
18585,I received silver nail clippers but they were not slanted as shown,3
18586,"Have used for several months, and have started to notice a difference in nail strength,  nails grow a little faster too",4

18589,"Cutting the netting off the flowers was a pain, but it was fun to have at our baby shower.",3
18590,"It's good for its price, I would say it's works for during the day meeting.",4
18591,I missed the fact that this product is an ointment not a lotion,3
18592,"no brushes and too big to carry in a purse and no mirror.
but nice colors and i like that it's matte and not sparkly",3
18593,Works like a charm.  A product that does what it claims it will do and more.,5
18594,Was a complete waste of money and will never purchase again. I took maxtan for 2 months with no results.,1
18595,Not sure on this one yet. Minimal results after a few weeks,3
18596,"Compact unit. Works very well. They should have made the hose longer, though.",4
18597,"ITS DONT LAST LONG, BUT ITS OKAY AND BRING THE PRICE DOWN A LITTLE AROUND 3.49 . SO THANKS FOR THE PRODUCT",3
18598,"I have tried others, this is the best Plastic cups could be more durable though, as they seem to pop under pressure.",4
18599,Haven't used them yet but they're a good quality product.,4
18600,be nice if it had a liner so I can use my own soap.,3
18601,"Thin material, typically sells at Walmart for 2.99. Not impressed",1
18602,I'm confused to whether this was a real bumble and bumble product because it felt different from the same product I've used on my hair.,2
18603,It was nice at first but they aren't durable and break easily.,3
18604,I really like this e wax. It is good quality and the packet is easy to reseal.,5
18605,I wasn't impressed by this product.  Its smelled ok.  I  was disappointed when i realized that it is not tear-free.,3
18606,I'm not really happy with this product. I bought this and tried it and it feels pretty rough on my skin.,1
18607,Works without irritation however the clip design could be better. I was only able to shave with it and not trim to the desired length,4
18608,Had this product for about a year. works well just have to replace the head every few months.,4
18609,"Very clever design, mirror pert not big enough for my eyesight.",4

18611,It's way too thin. It ripped on our first use.,1
18612,Easy to Use and Clean.. Battery backup could be little better... I am going to order Philips Men Shaver as well...,4
18613,The dropper does NOT fit on this bottle!!!,2
18614,This the best BB cream I have used. It has a nice matte finish.,5
18615,I don't care for it.  Maybe because I have't quite learned to use it yet.  It made my products too stiff and sticky.,2
18616,This is a great brand not as irritating as some and you don't feel like your skin is goopy..,4
18617,"Love the smell, wish the lotions was a bit thicker but I mixed it with one of my body creams and it is perfect!",4
18618,Great for adding to your bath water for whole body moisturizing.,5
18619,Hard and brittle. I don't much care for them.,1
18620,Does not get hot enough for a lasting wave.  Adequate but I expect the heating element to weaken.,3
18621,"These smell very different than the sticks by same manufacturer.  A lot more ""soapy"" and less ""creamy.""
They are a bit overwhelming.",3
18622,This product works great! Worth the money. It does exactly what I need it to do. I haven't had any problems with it.,5
18623,Says it fits the Respironics System One but it doesn't fit mine.,1
18624,I love it. Even when used gently there is still a slight...bite to it.,5
18625,It's light and powerful. I only gave the 4 stars because it does still nick the skin but not nearly as bad as most others.,4
18626,broke after only one time waring. waste of money.,2
18627,It came without a bar. It looks cute but it would be nice to wear it. Definitely returning,1

18630,"Broke the next day, get what you pay for. Not as pretty as the picture.",2
18631,This soap smells good and lathers up really well.  I would recommend this to everyone because it last a long time,5
18632,Bottles received but NO REUSABLE cotton pouches received!  What am I to use to store these beads?!?,4
18633,Couldn't get my always-reliable shower gel to break a lather with these. Back to a puff.,1
18634,great and easy to use bought before and will continue buying in the future.,4
18635,Bought this as a gift and so far so good.  My mother is enjoying this product.  She said it has great pressure and works well.,4
18636,This product kept sliding off my head and it doesn't stay in place long enough.,1
18637,Easiest way to get this product which is the only one for hard contact lens users; it's the only one my doctor recommends for me.,4
18638,Good product for the price.  Does dry lips out when applied alone but does better if Chapstick is applied first.,3
18639,"I was underwhelmed by these.

The sprayer head leaks where it screws into the little glass vial insert.

The sprayer itself works ok.",3
18640,"These are one of my favorite blades - they are consistently sharp and smooth, and the price can't be beat.",5
18641,"Man these blades are terrible. Take my advice, get Derbys.",1
18642,Some of the brushes fell apart after only a few uses.,2
18643,"Fell apart in the first two days. Very cute, if it stayed together. Not worth over anything over a dollar.",1
18644,Arrived opened  and leaking all over the box.  Tried shampoo but didn't help at all.  Still so itchy.,1
18645,I used this for personal grooming and it worked really well. I just wish it was waterproof so I could use it in the shower,4
18646,These were a big hit the mother and guess loved it also they were very simple to make,4
18647,"Wasn't  what I  expected , cleaning  surface very  small.",2
18648,Nice smell to it and works how it should. Used with the other 3D products and they go perfect together.,5
18649,Love this product. Cleans hair quickly and leaves hair soft.,5
18650,"Nice design, nice tools provided but is now leaking water like a sieve.",3
18651,"Nice products. Live the rose smell. Probably won't order again, so I guess it's not mind blowing",4
18652,Sizes run small. Order largest size for best fit. SUBSTANTIAL shrinkage after laundering.,3
18653,"Great tingly feeling.  Skin feels soft and really clean after using. Pores are clearer, not necessarily smaller.",5
18654,Probably not meant for nail art. Remover made the dyes bleed out and stain my natural nail. You get what you pay for.,1
18655,Did not fit.. Wasn't long enough.. I did not like how they felt. Thats all.. Just how I'm feeling. Thanks,1
18656,Loved the soft color and velvet feel.  Not so wild about the actual rose smell but small complaint for an overall good product.,5
18657,I was not happy with the color and it doesn't stay on very long has to be reapplied way too often.,3
18658,for the extra 3 bucks i loved this style over the other you don't have to worry with the allen wrench it was really heavy and well made,5
18659,use it on my hair eye brows eye lashes and can see a difference. smells great too ONLY need a little bit at a time,5
18660,These tapes do not stick at all.  I followed instruction to a tee and tapes pull right off face when band is attached and strtched.,1
18661,I love this product! It's great because the toner gets rid of acne and it soothe with the menthol infused with it!<3,5
18662,Not working for me. Waste of money!!!,1
18663,NIce since I could not find it locally really like this brand,4
18664,Had used it before and still love it. Perfect for my very dry and cracked heels.,5
18665,the product did not meet my expectations.....I probably am very unlikely to order it again...it was my error to expect another result,2
18666,I was looking for an alternative but this product did nothing for me as a woman of color. I went back to proactive,1
18667,"Gloves are nice, not overly abrasive. However it was delivered with. Giant hole in one of the gloves so I'm a little disappointed.",1
18668,I DO like this product but find that they are difficult to adhere to the nails. They came in good shape and fairly good time.,4
18669,Very sturdy and well made!  Very impressed.  My husband loved it!,4
18670,The packaging was extremly difficult to open....but overall the shaver is good quality and works great!,4
18671,didn't fit....not sure if it was their fault or mine.....,3
18672,Dirt cheap and better than any Gillette capsule I have used. Switch to DE shaving if you are on the edge (heh edge),4
18673,"Good service from seller. Shipped on time. The glycerin is good, I use it for making e-juice and it works great.",5
18674,Spray paints the scalp more than the hair. Don't waste your money.,1
18675,Its a nice scarf but it does not look like the picture. It isn't has flowey as the actual picture,3
18676,Great kids brush also has built in timer to change quadrants in their mouths,5
18677,Not bad for the price. Hoping it doesn't tear.  So far so good.,4
18678,Smells like chemicals . Very unnatural . I bought 4 and they all smelled like poison and a little almond,1
18679,"I like the functionality and look, however it tips over easily if I have extra rolls stored.",3
18680,product is what they say it to be i use it nearly everyday and it is great awesome product i love it,5
18681,"Nothing much to be said.  This is a chrome plated metal stand.  It fits a normal sized razor nicely, and looks good doing it.",5
18682,"Not as wide as I would have liked, but better than most tapes.",3
18683,"It is a great product once again I am not regreting using amazon.  I love it, I would recommend it to others.",4
18684,Hard to work with and I think I had a reaction.,2
18685,These were a lot smaller than i had anticipated and were hard to work with. definitely a sample box.,2
18686,"Very heavy and bigger than I thought. I can only wear It for a few hours because after that, my belly button starts to hurt.",2
18687,"Terrible! My hair turned out red not brown and broke me out bad, thought it was natural, no PPD or ammonia.",1
18688,If your expecting the scent of Patchouli you will be disappointed nice soap seems very gentle to the skin but I wish it smelled better.,1
18689,"I love the color , and I only have to apply it once for the whole day",5
18690,"It smells bad almost to the pint where it's nauseating. Terrible product, and it doesn't even work well.",1
18691,It works but the tips fall off the base too easy,3
18692,this wig is very thin i can see the lace and must be worn with a hat. over all the rest is fine the color was nice,2
18693,The set up is less clear than we liked but it is overall simple and will provide lots of fun for everyone.,4
18694,"It's works fine. They advertise it as quiet, that is not true it  sounds like a average blow dryer.",3
18695,"I'm not a huge fan, too bulky and not as user friendly as a regular one.",2
18696,It is defect. It is not possible to become a replacement.,1
18697,"They work fine, but they lose their grit quickly. Luckily there are a bunch of them in the box!",3
18698,A good razor and decent blades will treat you good believe me you just have to find what works for you!,3
18699,Love this product. It works great on my hair but i really want to know if it's waterproof. Does anyone know if its waterproof?,4
18700,THE PEACHY CREAM  OSO EASY ROSE ARRIVED IN GOOD CONDITION AND IS GROWING. I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO THE FIRST BLOOMS ! ! !,5
18701,This is a really great serum. I've tried many of these and this would be in my top 3,4
18702,Best stuff ever wish I would've discovered this years ago haven't had chap that since I started using it!!!!,5
18703,This frother is very good. Great speed. Takes much less time than the ikea frother.,5
18704,Nice and as advertised. Sent extra information and catalog as well as free marker.,4
18705,"does a great job gets into all the spots in between teeth, it  is does get the sink area a little messy though from the spray",4
18706,Does not work for me and dried skin out too much.,3
18707,It's not very refreshing like most mouthwashes and also it burns your mouth from time to time.  I think my teeth are getting whiter though.,4
18708,Too pale for me. Still looking for that perfect shade. Lining them all up with their corresponding #'s would help.,3
18709,"This pillow is well made yet was not for us.

Uncomfortable for both of us, waste of money",1
18710,Not the purple color shown. Came in black which was not what I wanted.,1
18711,They are 'pretty' but brush broke off of handle second day of use.,1
18712,"It's pretty, but care is needed because it is not made so well.  For the price, it is worth it.",3
18713,"It's made for small boy, the only issue I have with this product is the size.",3
18714,As advertised and was shipped in a timely manner. I am happy with this purchase and I highly recommend.,5
18715,It met all my expectations! It came early. Loved the colors.,3
18716,This Norelco is the best yet and I have owned 3 others over the years!,5
18717,"Bought for dogs ear forms. Didnt stay in long.
Not happy with product ",3
18718,Flowers aren't as bright as they are in the picture but are nice,5
18719,Took a little while to get but overal was great.,4
18720,These were a good quality. Although the size was a bit larger than I anticipated.,4
18721,"Its a cute necklace, I can't really complain other than it took a month to come but I do like it. Thanks!",4
18722,This stuff is absolute garbage.  It didn't straighten  my hair just made it greasy,1
18723,"Was not what I expected,it said 2 Necklace tags pendant not 1.",1
18724,i loved it... looks pretty big on the picture but its not that big!!! I love the colors and the case!,4
18725,It broke after 3 days. The whole lipstick fell out.,1
18726,Gets the job done but sweats off . smells good .,3
18727,"I bought this for my girlfriend. It's a good quality necklace, in my opinion... It reminds me of Cinderella...",4
18728,I prefer medium golden brown but it was not available.,3
18729,"OWNED MANY ELECTRIC RAZORS AND THIS IS THE BEST I EVER HAD. LONG LASTING CHARGE,GOOD SHAVE AND COMFORTABLE TO USE.",5
18730,"It's ok, thought it would work but haven't seen results.",2
18731,"Works great, comes off sometimes, but other than than it's great.",5
18732,It was smaller than i expected but besides this was perfect.,4
18733,Turns itself off at different times with no ryhme or reason.,1
18734,My wife loves this stuff.  In turn I get rather well lotioned peppermint scented hands :),5
18735,The dangly part fell off instantly when I took it out of the package.,1
18736,I will never be without this product in my makeup bag.  Price is more cost-effective on Amazon than in store.  Thank you!,5
18737,Worthless. The edge was sharpened at the incorrect angle and therefore does not grab cuticle at all. Threw it in the garbage.,1
18738,"Product works well enough, no complaints from the husband. I find that it smells very strong though & so does he, for a face moisturizer.",3
18739,It doesn't smell as good as I was hoping it would.,1
18740,"A little tight on the nose and doesn't fit completely right, but worth it for the price.",4
18741,PRODUCT WAS TOO OILY FOR MY SKIN. MADE ME LOOK EXTREMELY SHINY AND GREASY. DID NOT LIKE!,1
18742,Came neatly packaged. Like the carrying bag it comes in. All the rods bend.  Get nice curls/waves with these,5
18743,Good coverage but left my hair a little sticky throughout day,4
18744,It smells really good.  I get a lot of compliments every time i wear it.  I would definitely be buying more of this.,4
18745,I have used this product for at least three years now and it still works great.  I charge it about once a month and use it daily,5
18746,"These are flexible but durable, and the string stays put, unlike many other tanning goggles I've owned.",4
18747,I wish I purchased this years ago. For me it works much better than sting floss.,5
18748,"Anyone knows how long it takes to see the color change?
I don't see an change on my gray hair at all....",2
18749,Haven't used it but two or three times so far.,3
18750,"My girls love this - wish it ran longer - they also hide the stickers in the instructions.  Overall, I do recommend it.",4
18751,recommended by my dentist..seems to be doing a good job..prompt delivery..,4
18752,This product is well made and very good for dry skin problems.  The temperature can be adjusted to any comfort level.,4
18753,"Doesn't seem to get very hot. Not like any of my other hair appliances, and has no setting for adjusting the temperature.",2
18754,"The soap seems to work well, the plastic tubs the soap was contained in have completely fallen apart, low quality packaging",3
18755,Allows the razor and brush to dry out.  Works just fine.  I just would have liked to find it in polished brass.,5
18756,"Glitter was very big, even with a Shellac Clear Coat on top still fell off after a day or two",3
18757,Got a very bad rush from it. Plus this does not stick very well after only a short period. Won't buy it again,1
18758,"Nice hard soap, won't dissolve in the shower. But I was hoping for something with a stronger aroma and more bubbles.",3
18759,"I thought I ordered purple because of the package, but it's black!",2
18760,"Wish I could return, very underpowered for my thick, wavy hair.  Has virtually no effect. Might work well on thinner hair.",2
18761,It slightly lightened my acne marks..but did nothing for my sun damage or even out my complexion,2
18762,Love it.  Still finding the best way to work it.  The cool tip is a great feature.,5
18763,"I'm very impressed with this shaver.  It gives a much closer shave than the Norelco I used in the past, and holds a charge well.",5
18764,Not nearly as cool as the photo. Kinda cheap feeling and looking. Disappointed.,2
18765,"It works very good
Easy to maintain and clean
Water container a little bit small

Excellent cleaning, and a refreshing feeling after you are done",4
18766,Cannot read size on pkg. sleeve pkg was not as expected. Wase.,2
18767,"Compare this with Philips' Air Floss, I found the Waterpik gave more thorough cleaning but a little bite messier. I like Waterpik better.",5
18768,I love all of Josie Maran products!  Her hand creme is silky never sticky and it goes where ever I go!,5
18769,So far so good. Tried other lines and they broke out my skin. So far so good with this line.,4
18770,This has to be fake...it is nothing like a real beauty blenspder and I ordered two....so sad I lost hard earned money on this,1
18771,"i have noticed it seems to help my gums a bit but i still need to regular floss, which is dissapointing",4
18772,These taste just like their names.  They have good coverage too.,5
18773,"The pric per ounce is wrong.  $32 for 12 ounces (4 3-ounce packages) is $2.66/ounce, not $0.74/ounce as is advertised",3
18774,Does not do what the hype claims it does. Very disapointing don't waste your hard earned cash!  Seriously not worth it.,1
18775,"I've heard that these lip paints are messy but I found with minimal application with a lip brush, they are lovely.",4
18776,I used it as indicated but despite de bad taste my little boy (4 years) started to use to this flavor,2
18777,It is minty and soothing. No improvement in my gum health.,3
18778,Really helps keep food from sticking between teeth and is very easy to use.  My sister recommended it and I was very happy that she did.,5
18779,"Works good, no problems with unit.  Even after brushing, I still got stuff out with this waterpic.",4
18780,Doesn't fit. My daughter is 7 and couldn't even for her head!,1
18781,"It Was what I was what I was looking for, and it was user friendly. I am pleased with my purchase.",4
18782,"Works very well on cuticles, but when applied it is orange. I let it sit on my nails for a little bit than wipe it off.",4
18783,"Nail clippers did not work, I don't recommend anyone buying. They are not sharp",1
18784,It's wayyy too short. If my cartilage swells ANY it will get infected ASAP,2
18785,Great size. Holds shave brush well. Razor holder won't hold a Mach 3 razor which is a bummer.,4
18786,Very pretty and looks just like it shows in the picture.,4
18787,"Smells all-right, my wife thought I was wearing cologne.  Seems impossible to get just a little, you get way too much with the slightest squeeze.",4
18788,"Very minty.  I hate mint flavored stuff.  Otherwise, it's just horribly overrices.  Waxed string.  What a ripoff!",2
18789,"Didnt do much in terms of sweat control, but kept my hair from flying all over in my face. 3/5",3
18790,So far so good.  Maybe I should get back to you after my next dentist appointment.,4
18791,But what else did you expect for the price. Wasn't gonna be a piece of Tiffany's fine merchandise. Looks better in the picture.,2
18792,"The color glaze left my hair a bit heavy"" and not as fluffy as I would have liked.",3
18793,If this product was ordered on my account I would like this investigated.  I would like my money refunded if I paid for this on my account.,1
18794,"soap works great, the bar is about twice the size of a normal bar and takes some getting used to though.",5
18795,It works well and leaves my hair clean and smelling like apples. It did a great job on my dandruff. I am very happy with it.,4
18796,I returned this item as the vertical component was loose on the base causing it to wobble and not sit vertical.,2
18797,Works decent but pointy and hurts my daughter's head.,3
18798,"The lock does not work with the key provided. But still usefull  ,the delivery was fast .",4
18799,Its a shame GiGi did not put the honee wax in the kit,4
18800,It may be that I got one with a bad battery but a charge doesnt last even 5 minutes.,2
18801,Ridiculously difficult to keep in place !  Very disappointed in this product.,2
18802,This product is really cool one from Phillips. It is easy to use and trimming nicely.... I am so happy.,4
18803,Best edge control everrrrrrrrrrrr!!! Makes my hair so soft when I wash it out. No edge control has ever done that before!,5
18804,This turned my moms hair dark brown. Which is weird.,1
18805,Did not work for my nails...Sally Hansen nail dry far superior product,1
18806,Favorite bath gloves. Compared to others they are thick and can last year at least.,5
18807,"Love the belly ring, except I wore it for 2 weeks and the silver is washing off and turning orange.",3
18808,"Not good for shaving private areas, will catch skin and cut them to make you bleed",2
18809,I have used this product for a long time and it does a great job.  It lasts about 30 to 45 days for me.,5
18810,It really allows the hair to grow.  It is an awesome product.  It must be used every night for the best results.,4
18811,I do not know if anyone opened it before. There is one tape less.,3
18812,"Terrible, The stick came off the instant I opened it. It went into the bin finally.",1
18813,"Smells wonderful but doesn't work well for thick, curly hair.  I was disappointed because it was recommended by my beautician",3
18814,It's EXTREMELY LIGHTER than pictured. It looks like very very very light pink when it arrived and looks the same when tried it on.,1
18815,Works well to help heal dry and charred skin areas.,4
18816,"Very oily but makes skin feel soft so i only use it at night, great product though.",4
18817,I bought these to trim my split ends. Pretty sure these are just causing more split ends. Not as sharp as advertised.,1
18818,Thought it would be more Plum color but has some coral to it.  If I put two layers on its a more plum color.,4
18819,"Let me qualify - Red looked horrible on me.  The wig was really nice, but I sent it back,  Ordered a different color...",1
18820,"Famous Nars color, but not bright enough for me.  My skin absorbs color, and I looked washed out.  Maybe I should layer it.",3
18821,"I guess I am used to using a different band for my face,I really did not see any difference using Avalon Organics.",3
18822,Good quality.  Sturdy build.  Not an every day tool as it makes the skin a little rough.,3
18823,Doesn't seem to stay on no matter what I do.,1
18824,LOVE IT!  MY SKIN GLOWS AND MY HAIR IS SO SHINING AND DOES NOT MAKE YOUR HAIR OILY.  MY HUSBAND LOVES IT AS WELL,5
18825,"I did not use everyday, so I could not say it worked or not. From the smell and touch, it is great.",4
18826,"There's no down side to this item. Great price, easy to use,and they add beauty & bling to any design...great item!",5
18827,super sharp blades. perfecto. much better than other brands we've tried,5
18828,It does okay but not for the specific acne I have.,3
18829,Very good quality and seems like it will last a very long time. I would definitely recommend for keeping you counter clean and adds a nice look.,5
18830,I think this product is great! It works quickly and I feel better about using my sonicare toothbrush everyday knowing it's clean.,4
18831,I LOVE this serum! My wrinkles seem to be disappearing! I love their entire line of facial products! I highly recommend!,5
18832,Almost looks white rather than light flesh but it will be covered with make up so I don't really care,4
18833,Terrible tool with very weak brushes; useless for cleaning my shaver and I have just thrown in my drawer. Time to throw it away!,1
18834,"Not too thick or too thin, holds moisture in without being too hot. Feel good.",4
18835,Awesome!  Thank you!  My husband will be delighted!,5
18836,The sponge is a bit smaller than I'd like but still does the job. I like it. Will probably buy a couple more.,4
18837,"Jason brand! A lot of their products are gold, some don't place though. now if they just made polish with natural dyes",4
18838,Excellent shaver. Shaves close. A shame they don't male this model anymore.,5
18839,"smells good, but my skin felt dry halfway through the day",3
18840,Did not make any difference.  Used this product everyday until it was gone.  Nothing.,1
18841,"I feel the color is a little darker than expected,but I think it is quite suitable for me.",4
18842,"Already fell apart. The sponge came off the wand. It's a good size, but hard to use without wand.",2
18843,This is great! Refreshing and keeps your fett from cracking in the winter.  Great Product,5
18844,"My first try at using this product. Smells terrible, leave hair feeling very oily and sticky. Not happy",1
18845,Not what I was expecting... Smelled terrible.  Ditched after a few sprays. Would NOT  recommend it.,1
18846,This was recommended by my dermatologist. It really helps my dry skin problem.,5
18847,Love all the great smells! Love this soap. Highly reccomend,5
18848,Came very fast. Look like original. No instructions.,4
18849,What a waste of money they broke within 2days they come apart easily,1
18850,Do not waste your money. I followed the directions and never saw a change in the size of my arms.,1
18851,"This is truly great for helping sleep anytime. Only con it is really big at first, but it is adjustable.",3
18852,Reminds me of Vaseline. I don't see what it's doing to help anything.,3
18853,"My skin is very oily, and this worked great!  Best mask I've ever used. I mixed with witch hazel and tea tree oil.",5
18854,"I bought this for my husband's birthday, it has been very stirdy and looks nice on the counter.",5
18855,I can not use it.  Is is too wide.,1
18856,"BEWARE ... at least in MY case, caused some ""hair loss""!",4
18857,SATISFIED WITH MY PURCHASE. SELLER IS SERIOUS. THE PRODUCT IS AS SHOWN ON PAGE. I recommend it.,5
18858,Amplified is not nearly as beautiful a shade as the regular formula.,3
18859,Received the bottle with one pill/capsule open and have only ordered this product twice.,2
18860,It does a good job. The handpiece keeps breaking. We are on our forth waterpik.,3
18861,"This is an o.k. body wash. Nothing great though, not worth the price.",3
18862,"The clip keep slipping off the corners, its not working well for me at all. Its not doing what i thought it would",1
18863,I don't really hate it...just bought it accidentally .,1
18864,the brushes are the size of a can of soda..a small 75cent can of soda..the picture is not really what you will recieve...sooooo disappointed..,2
18865,"Did not work for me, plus made my skin so tight it looked like shoe leather.  Yet, it did not stop perspiration.",1
18866,"whilst this is great, it broke, which was disappointing",3
18867,I should have read the reviews. I end up getting a syringe from my veterinarian. Not worth the wait. Coming from overseas.,1
18868,"The size is too smaller than I expected, maybe I can use it for my dog.",1
18869,Average sharpness.  The design makes it hard to get a good cut though.,1
18870,"Don't need the two,toes wrapped,...mostly looking for more cushion.",3
18871,They looks pretty but they are too heavy for my ears and after wearing them my ears starts getting hurt....,1
18872,It works great! Came in the mail quick too!,4
18873,Recommended by my dentist.  It has held up for a couple of years now.,4
18874,Item was exactly what was on advertise and reached on time.,5
18875,It stays put through the night. Silky and great color! Love it,5
18876,"I am a happy with the product - I mix it with lotion and apply, definitely improved my skin and hair.",4
18877,I recieved 2 brown sets instead of one brown one black,2
18878,"Color was okay, but not the exact color I
wanted.",4
18879,"it does work, you will love this product put it on before you work out  with the neopene short, WOW great",5
18880,"Love this scent, sprayer, and value. One bottle lasts me months.",5
18881,"It's long lasting. Red shades go on great, lighter shades are streaky. I love this color in particular.",4
18882,Great moisturizer but not much help on the dark spots. Am buying again and will continue to do so. Thanks.,4
18883,"Love this, was spending 10 dollars to wax my eyebrows every other week and 22 for my legs. Defitnetley convinient.",5
18884,"Worked great for a couple of days, now we have to take the top off most days to get the alcohol out.",3
18885,Bottle arrived broken. Have not been able to try it.,1
18886,over priced but this is what my hubby needs for his shaver..does the trick for his shaving needs. Maybe he needs a new shaver?!,3
18887,Good blades but they seem to dull quickly. Given the price they're a good deal though!,4
18888,I use this to sanitize my Sonicare brush head and have been happy with its effectiveness.,4
18889,"Very cheaply made.  The clasp came apart almost immediately.  You get what you pay for, I guess.",2
18890,Have used Waterpik Flossers for some time now and they keep my gums healthy and so the dentist is happy too!,4
18891,Weak application for things and stuff. The angled small brush doesn't pack product well. The blush brush is extremely weak and flimsy,2
18892,Very nice blush - goes on evenly and well - wish it would have had a brush though.,5
18893,Just stopped working not long after purchasing. Would get a refund but its past the window..,1
18894,Exactly what I wanted. Good quality so far and good price.,4
18895,"Didn't like it, has like sparkles and shines, never used it.",1
18896,This is my first  dentures . Dentist didn't give me much instructions. This is a  long standing product so can only imagine good review.,4
18897,"Artificial smell and taste, greasy, of questionable origin. Perhaps homemade?  No ingredients or manufacture listed.  Avoid.",1
18898,"Perfect for dry skin, healing tattoos and even for after laser tattoo removal.",5
18899,"I should have listen to the other reviews about this product being an overpriced jar of Vaseline, because it is.",2
18900,I use this product daily. Very refreshing. Purchased many months' supply. Would highly recommend to anyone who has never tried a body mist before.,5
18901,"this is not the first time i've bought this, but one of the three bottles i've bought wes open... i wonder why!!!",3
18902,Honestly seems nothing more than alcohol. Could take it or leave it.,3
18903,Better then the rubber band eye patch but still would like a bit larger eye area coveraga,4
18904,"it has a good scent however does not provide excellent protection, just Ok, it lasts for few hrs but not whole day",3
18905,"Nice light scent, doesnt seem greasy...nice, thick lotion...would buy again",4
18906,"Good smell, works ok. I must have desert dry cuticles...",4
18907,My skin must be sensitive. I got a rash sheet a few hours.,3
18908,Showed up and must've been used it had mold growing in it.  Plus it barely pooped steam. Extremely disappointed.,1
18909,JUST POOR VALUE AND QUALITY. PUT WATER ON YOUR FACE BETTER RESULTS. VERY EXPENSIVE.,1
18910,"This is the only floss that works for me, as my teeth are very close together.",5
18911,"Used these once, and the next day my teeth hurt. I will not be using these again.",1
18912,"Love this lotion.  The scent is heavenly without being too sweet or cloying, and it smooths my dry skin very nicely.",5
18913,It didn't fit the head of a 4 year old child...a little girl...too small,2
18914,"Seems like an okay product, just wanted one that rotated.",2
18915,This is the most comfortable bra I own.  Wish I hadn't waited so long before trying it.  Money well spent.,5
18916,"I had been using this same product from another company and was spending about 10 times the amount!  Great, subtle scent.  Great value!",5
18917,I have blephartitis and this is the perfect cleansing solution to keep my eyelids from swelling or getting irritated.  I also received shipment very quickly.,5
18918,I tried this brand blindly based on a review from a talk show. Absolutely love it. I would order again.,5
18919,Works well.  Doesn't pull hairs. My new Panasonic ES2207P works about the same.  Use this product at times.  Glad I bought it.,4
18920,will change the stars when someone explains how that much iron can be good.,1
18921,"I love this product! I have tried different organic creams, and this is my favorite",5
18922,Nice quality - very sturdy and well made. Holds new badger brush perfectly - does not hold Mach 3 razor handle,4
18923,Excellent product! I love Oyin Handmade products! Very moisturizing quality products.,5
18924,"No, i think i should have picked a different shape.",1
18925,The men's smell a whole lot better than the women's I will be getting the men's now,1
18926,the water pressure on high just slides through the teeth and cleans remarkably well. just before bedtime and better breath in the morning.,4
18927,"Love this thing (my teeth and gums do, too!).  Kinda noisy but really effective flosser.  Would definitely recommend it w/out hesitation.",5
18928,"Only works really well with short hair, with longer hair its not so crazy good. But good product anyways",4
18929,"This is simply the best shaving cream on the market! Thanks go to Amazon for a great bulk purchase
price.",5
18930,"Works as advertised.  It does not leave a greasy residue, as have others I have tried in the past.",5
18931,"Product worked well, but the bottle broke when it was knocked off the counter. I was a little disappointed in that.",4
18932,Not as strong as ABS...but more durable after acrylic application....way better way to get those stillettos minus the filling. Worth the price.,4
18933,"Confusing, this product is not what I ordered and does not work for my machine.  I guess it what you pay for",1
18934,Its just a beaded that I could have gotten from a beauty supply for less and it tangled and snagged my locs... will not purchase again,1
18935,Sucked !!!!!!! Don't Waste Your Money .,1
18936,Tastes great with a fair price. Lasts a while.,5
18937,don't irritate my ears. can wear all the time,4
18938,My favorite color:) a nice brown with some sparkles. I would recommend to a friend any day of the week!!!,5
18939,"It's a bit larger than I thought. For the price, it is nicely made.",4

18941,this bracelet is so cute my daughter love owels so i got it for her sent in a timely manner and cute as a botten,4
18942,This is one of the best Aqua Glycolic body cleansers I have found.  I think it leaves your skin feeling very clean and the scent is fresh,4
18943,The bristles are still very sharp after at least 20 uses. I'll keep using it and hope it gets softer. It travels nicely.,4
18944,These are so adorable. Love them. More than what I expected!,5
18945,I just needed something to hold me over until my wax. Works well.,4
18946,"service was prompt. Item was good, will use again",4
18947,The product it's okay I like it fits well but need more work it fits my head very well,5
18948,for my face. Really good stuff. I would recommend it to all my friends. it is a very good product,5
18949,This was useful for about 3 times then the seam split and began leaking air.  Such a waste of money.,2
18950,Smells so good. I buy this for my husband and he loves it.,5
18951,I love the colors but you have to watch they fall out easy.,3
18952,"I don't have the forensic tools to tell if this thing works well, but for piece of mind, it's a great little uv unit.",5
18953,"These work fine, the only gripe I have is the wax glue that stays on the center part of the razor due to its packaging.",4
18954,This product gives me bumps on my face!!! I would never use again!,1
18955,"After a short time, the pause button started sticking in the paused position, making the unit useless.",1
18956,This helps my ear lobes that have stretched and are very low.  Could it be better yes but every little bit helps!,4
18957,"I have two at doifferent houses, they deteriorate (chrome scales off, starts to rust) within a year. Too much humidity in shower perhaps.",2
18958,haven't had it long enough to tell if it works,4
18959,Good waterpik overall. Minus 1 star because the button on the handle sometimes get stuck. The newer WP-660 model replaced it with an on-off switch.,4
18960,The bottle developed a huge crack within a couple months. I did not drop it or mishandle it in any way.,1
18961,Like the product but not as creamy as I thought it would be.,3
18962,This brush lasted for a whole two months....crap....don't buy,1
18963,"I do my own nails and this is great when you want to ""BLING"". Great colors and a large amount of stones.",5
18964,I love the fact that I got so many choices of color with different sizes and it will be easy to use,5
18965,"These were purchased several years ago for another razor.  The product lasted, but the razor itself broke where the heads attached.",4
18966,I wa really hoping this smelled like almond. However the product has a unappealing additional smell. I was disappointed.,1
18967,This product is amazing. Absolutely perfect when you need a quick touch up in between salon visits.  I would definitely buy it again.,5
18968,I absolutely adore this rod set!! It works wonders for my hair and are super easy to use! I would recommend to all.,5
18969,"Everyone will be different when it comes to blades. But for me, these Astra's are amazing, especially for the price! Highly recommend!",5
18970,"I have been diagnosed with peridontal disease and this thing keeps the pockets cleaned out, even just using the regular attachment.  Love the tongue cleaner too.",5
18971,These are some of the least sharp not smooth blades I have ever used.,1
18972,didn't see the use in it have got it since don't think would of cooked with probably a different one.,3
18973,You can't see the different colors or glitter on your eyelashes. Very unhappy!!,1
18974,Easy to use solution and makes heads smooth and clean. Razor heads move smoothly and cleanly! Make shaving smooth and easy!,4
18975,Flossing is still necessary periodically.  This is better than not flossing but a bit sloppy.  Takes a little less time.,3
18976,Very good product for fine/thin hair.  Does help with texture and thickness.,4
18977,It's OK. I like the Dr Bronners product better. The peppermint scent smells very chemical,4
18978,Didn't find that it helped with dry cuticle. Prefer Sally Hansen's Cuticle Rehab.,2
18979,This is the best floss for those with bridges. I would buy from this seller again.,5
18980,"It only worked for one year. It stoped pumping water after a year. For the price, I expect it can last longer. Disappointed.",2
18981,"Great as long as you use the guard. If you try to get closer, all it does is pull the hair. Ouch!",1
18982,I really like how it does the work. I will buy it again.,5
18983,It has been about 3 weeks and my lashes seem fuller and longer.  I can't wait to see what happens in the next two months.,4
18984,"this blade when used without the trimmer ,is rough crappy metal that snags and pinches your skin and pulls your hair, to the extent of blood..",1
18985,This product does not work. I wouldn't buy this item again.,1
18986,Smells nice. Not very gritty. Tingles when it's on the face but disnt really work for me.,2
18987,"Did not stay in the holder very long, the netting fell apart shortly after a couple of uses.  Would never buy again",1
18988,Not good at all. It did not stay on my 4 years old daughter's head. I should have return it.,1
18989,Weird but it gave me allergy on my left hand. Stopped taking it and allergy stopped..,1
18990,"Makes hair look greasy even with just a dab. Hardly any hold strength. Go for purple if you want natural, matte shaping",1
18991,What can you say product works well and shuts off my dirty razor light. It's all about price here,5
18992,It maybe good ! But the smell and taste is gross!!,2
18993,It's ok.  Decent price.  Nothing super special.  Enough said.,3
18994,This is a little softer than I'd like but overall it's a really nice soap. Great for my teenagers complexion.,4
18995,Did not work for me at all wig was still sliding off,1
18996,I didn't know it was lined. I was looking for something much lighter since my head tends to sweat at night.,2
18997,"good, my only issue is that the smell is some strong",4
18998,It came quickly... It was perfect sizing. I loved it. I would use these people again without thinking twice about it.,4
18999,I just love these. They are so bendy and rubbery feeling than other sunnies. They are way more comfortable to wear.,5
19000,"If you are looking for longevity, go for it. I couldn't stand the chemical smell and felt like I was wearing varnish.",2
19001,This is a nice wide dental floss that gets the sides of your teeth very well.,5
19002,"I love the fragrance and it leaves my hair very silky.  Combined with the Bvlgari Conditioner, this is my favorite brand.",5
19003,I bought this toothbrush and it stopped working after less than 3 weeks of use.  I was very unhappy with it.,1
19004,"Works great, trims consistently, battery life is excellent! Easy to clean and maneuver.",5
19005,I really love this blush.  It goes on well and is a beautiful rosey berry color.  I removed one star because of the price.,4
19006,I'm happy with the Norelco shaver. It does a very good job on the private area and underarms. I like it.,4
19007,I LOVE THIS AIR BRUSH. IT IS EASY TO USE AND DOES NOT TANGLE MY HAIR.  THE LARGE HANDLE IS EASY TO USE WITH MY ARTHRITIS,5
19008,I wouldn't recommend.  It does not fit my phone the Galaxy S3 much smaller & very cheap looking.  Very very disappointed,1
19009,The metal case that pops open for cleaning won't stay closed.  It popped up continuously and the blades flew in all directions.,1
19010,"Excellent quality and lovely smell - will continue to purchase this brand and ""flavor"".",5
19011,AFTER A SHORT TIME IT STARTED TO LEAK.  IT DOES NOT LEAK EVERY TIME BUT OFTEN ENOUGH TO BE A PAIN.,3
19012,not much for the condition of my hair/scalp I ordered. you can give it a try it may work for you.,3
19013,I sleep with this on but it does come off during the night. I do see temporary results but not long lasting.,4
19014,"Works well, but the motor is too loud. I would use it more often if it was quieter.",3
19015,Love this hairspray! I got enough to last awhile.,5
19016,Bought for my daughter's friend. Both of them loved it!,4
19017,Waste of money!!  Did absolutely NOTHING for my sides!  Maybe the next person will have better results then I did!,2
19018,Good stuff.  Use it primarily as diaper rash prevention.,5
19019,This is the best bodywash ever. It has a calming scent and wonderful texture. The little pink pearls really do something.,5
19020,it helps strech the time between colorings. stays in place and doesn't sweat out.,4
19021,I ordered 2 20pc sets and around 26/27 actually had the stone in the jewelry. I guess you get what you pay for.,1
19022,Have not real comparison. It is what is expected. Inexpensive shaving razors. Works fine.,4
19023,"Very cute but should have more wide headbands.  Also, after cutting to size, there was excess material waisted.",3
19024,Came early. Had all the colors . What more can you ask for? Awesome price too!,5
19025,it is alright. similar to what u get in a lower end hotel. i was expecting more and would not pay for this.,3
19026,"Not as big as the first one I found, but still nice, worth the wait A+",4
19027,Not so sure it worked at all. Still smell pet urine in back yard.,2
19028,good back up brush. I carry it in my car,3
19029,"Solidly built, does what it is designed for and looks good doing it",4
19030,"The glitter is peeling away from the headband, so I would not reccomend to anyone. Even with the cheap price",1
19031,Reaches and fits everywhere! My teeth are extremely hard to get floss between but these are plenty strong enough to fit without breaking.,5
19032,"Some of the stickers in the packs are defective. They break apart during application, but most of them do last for three to four days.",3
19033,I love it. Smell so Good. I will like to buy more in future,5
19034,They broke fast and thier where to small for my hair and hair ha is is thin so i dnt recommended,1
19035,"Works great!!!
My hair looks better feels better and is healthier.",4
19036,Love this stuff makes my skin feel great the only brand I buy just wish it did not cost so much,5
19037,it was bent when I received it and it was just horrible!,1
19038,Agian it was what I wanted and it got here in time for what I wanted. la te da da,5
19039,"they are ok ,but  sometimes the hair  is coming out :),but is a really good price for this amount of brushes",3
19040,It does the job and priced right! If you are looking for a nice shaver that does not cost too much money. This is the one!,4
19041,Paid more then what I usually pay for this product.,3
19042,I use this for my hair. I love the smell its wonderful!!!,5
19043,it is good. it is a greasy based product so I only use it at certain times. I use it for dry feet,4
19044,slightly burn my skin. chemical smell. cheap design.,2
19045,A plus for tired eyes . I noticed the dark circles under my eyes lighten up. They are easy to use and non irritating.,4
19046,Lo he estado usando por 2 semanas todas las noches y me gusta como me deja la piel. Mi piel se siente mas suave y radiante,4
19047,Works great very satisfied with the product would order another one if I ever needed it,4
19048,"If you are going to buy the game, you might as well buy all the expansion packs. This is the best way to do that.",5
19049,Just stopped working after 6 months. Its not a battery problem. I tried changing batteries multiple times but nothing worked. Very disappointed,1
19050,i have been using these for a couple of weeks now and don't really see a difference.,2
19051,Smells great! But it doesn't look like this.,4
19052,I'm using braces and this product is a must for a good hygiene.,4
19053,was exactly what i anticpated it is like getting teeth cleaned at the dentist only alot more comfortable def recomend,4
19054,"I have to say that this product was a ""dud"" for me. I wanted it to work, but was disappointed.",1
19055,A very useful and easy to use product. Quality build. Have bought multiple units.,5
19056,worked well. Def dark on brown hair but still cool!,4
19057,Nice jacket but size runs very small..I ordered a 2x but it fit like a large..very disappointed.,3
19058,I bought these to use with gel polish and they work great for the 3D art!,4
19059,I love how this product adds volume to my hair.  It is not sticky and is still soft and shiny.,5
19060,Great concept but defiantly on the pricey side especially when it snags and pull hair!,2
19061,"The product was a good buy as it was a lot more expensive at stores around here...
Works well keeping my teeth cleannner..",4
19062,Otherwise the file works well.  It would have been nice too see their tips and suggestions on a CD though.,4
19063,"I like the fact that it is small/compact
but wish it was more powerful.
My old waterpik was too big but flow of water was much stronger.",4
19064,"I like it, I have one that is similar and it is very old and wanted a backup.",4
19065,Scent reminds me of maple syrup. Gives my hair great shine. Kind of expensive but a little seems to go a long way.,4
19066,"Shaver Knives do not work, they do not cut my beard and mustache. They are old as they are used about 1000 times before",1
19067,These things are great!  I use one every night and my chest is always wrinkle free.,5
19068,Really like the product. Works great on the hair! But it's expensive for the amount of product you get!,4
19069,"Great product - kids love it and it smells good, too.  Easily rinses out of hair and leaves hair nicely manageable.",5
19070,"Great for the price. It looks fuller in the picture than it actually is, but it's a good buy considering how cheap it is.",4
19071,I use this in my 5 yr old sons hair.  I love the smell and feel of it.  Not oily at all,5
19072,"Had to return this,  I didn't like the smell.",2
19073,It works but not as good as a electric remington Under powered Blades seem slow when rotating I won't buy another on..,3
19074,The product arrived in a timely manner and appears to be working well,4
19075,I have natural nails and use these for clean up when doing nails.  One is really enough but always good to have backups!,4
19076,"I have several Rimmel provocalips, this one dries out quicker on my lips and flakes a bit.",4
19077,I absolutely loved these I actually use them for my Tragus because you can use them vice versa as for the nose rings they were perfect for my ear,5
19078,Horrible product because it is very oily and leaves accordingly on your nice dress shirts. Unfortunate because I do like the organic ingredients.,1
19079,Hate it!!!! Wax never got hot enough!!,1
19080,This was a lot bigger than I thought it would be.,2
19081,Works good you should handle it delicately though because it will rip easy but works good,4
19082,"Smells great and really does its job! The brush in the one I ordered came a little bent, but it's manageable.",5
19083,Smells bad...does not work at all. Never will buy it again..:(,1
19084,Broke after 6 months bad nicad batteries. Warranty not honored. There is a better and newer model Norelco QT4070 for a fraction of the price.,1
19085,I purchased this item for my teenager; who has braces. She loves the feel of the Water Pik. She says it massages her gums.,4
19086,Not very professional - not powerful as it doesn't even feel like 1875 watts - for the price actually pretty crappy.,2
19087,Doesn't feel cheap and my nephew loved it!!!,5
19088,"Have never use water flossers until dentist recommended same.  The water pick was fantastic immediately stopped gum soreness and cleaned between teeth great.
Dave Thomas",5
19089,I like the color it does look the same on me as it does on the picture and I'm black,4
19090,loved my pair of groves just seems as if they would fall apart soon like most the cheap ones do.,4
19091,I wasn't as impressed with this as other reviews I've read..I have awful dry skin and it did nothing for me.,4
19092,"I originally bought this for an adult, but it ended up only fitting my 6 year old.",3
19093,I would definitely recommend . Smells absolutely wonderful. Many...many compliments  I wear it quite often . Not too potent..excellent,4
19094,"Um, it works.  I can't believe it, but it works.  Wear this everywhere!  Home, work and play - get your way.",5
19095,"i am a native hawaiian with coarse ""frizzy"" hair and this product holds it down and gives me the look i am going for.",5
19096,Not as powerful as I would have wanted but does the job! It is good for the money! Buy it !,3
19097,The toner is good for me since I use it as a water mask.,4
19098,Has always worked for me.  I first found it in Egypt and used it again in China.,5
19099,"They don't work all that well, are hard to put in and they make your neck REALLY sore after wearing them for part of the day.",2
19100,"good shaver , but i think the accessories should come free for all that money",4
19101,Amazon has the best price with a $35 order otherwise I would never buy it.  It does help when you are using a dry electric shaver.,4
19102,My order was for the 1 1/2 inch barrel but I received the 1 inch barrell,2
19103,Worked great and did the job well. My teeth are clean and white.,4
19104,I wish I could find their purple bottled CoQ10 cleanser. This isn't quite the same.,3
19105,"Not to rough not too soft, just right. Fit and work well.",4
19106,"This product looked cheap. Do not buy, especially if you have thick hair.",1
19107,"I liked the belly ring, it just tarnished very fast is the only thing I didn't like.",3
19108,"Good product. I use it to add to laundry soap that i make at home. Pleasant fragrance, arrived on time....",4
19109,"It broke down after 2 weeks. It simply doesn't work anymore, I press the button nothing happens.",1
19110,"There was fungus in the lipstick all over, saw it as i opened the package",1
19111,they scare me being from china in all god knows what is in them. They work but I am going to rethink buying them.,1
19112,worked great until the handheld part broke off from its hose.  now its worthless.,2
19113,"Medium sized cape, great snap closures, would be better with a clip for custom fittings. Simple black and keeps the hair out lol",4
19114,Very hard not to spray too much in one spot!!,3
19115,"Color is good, product, once applied, stays on... but difficult to apply without smearing.",3
19116,My wife says they are too soft.  Not really strong.,2
19117,"I find that Dr. Bronners lathers easier with less.  The scent is pleasing enough, though.  I would not purchase again.",2
19118,I love this product. Its perfect for touch-ups throughout the day and especially on the beach.,5
19119,"Took a while to get here :/ but they seem good, the hairs don't fall out and they're very soft!",4
19120,It's ok...I use it in addition to flossing. It is noisy and messy.,3
19121,Great shaving cream. Great price for so many. Works great - less nicks.,5
19122,good lipstick holders for the price; helps me to keep my colors organized.,4
19123,I wasn't sure how it was going to perform but I am very happy with the purchase.  Recommend it to everyone.,5
19124,WAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY TOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO LONG!! I GUESS I CAN ADJUST IT BUT WTF !! THIS ISNT WHAT I EXPECTED,1
19125,"The Strings are very short.  You can barely go around your hard, do not recommend for bigger heads.",2
19126,Very pricey for what you get. General quality of Braun shaver is good but the cost of replacement parts seems to be a gouge.,3
19127,I love everything about this sunscreen but smell. It is not unpleasant but I wish it was fragrance free.,4
19128,Makes skin very soft-do not leave on too long made my skin very red,4
19129,Good price and was here sooner than I thought. The owl is a little bigger than I thought too but like it a lot.,4
19130,"The shaver is great, but nothing and I mean nothing beats Panasonic's linear shavers.  Well worth the extra money.",4
19131,"Head doesn't bobble much but it will serve it's purpose for topping the graduation cake.
:) I love Wilton products.",4
19132,The cape is fine but there's no way to adjust it around the neck,3
19133,Leaves a burnings sensation when it is sprayed on hair.,1
19134,does what they are designed to do if you plenty of lube and go slowly great quality,5
19135,After using this product for 2 weeks the stop button on the hand unit started sticking and is no longer useful.,2
19136,The instructions are not clear nor do all the heads fit in the box.  It has also cut my gums in spots.,1
19137,Not much fragrance. More carrier oil than essential oil.,3
19138,"Love this thing, something about wood . The lid gets held closed buy the soap not a bad thing. Stayed closed while in transit.",5
19139,"It did well, but once the water gets low enough it won't diffuse anymore. It's wasting some of the oil which bothers me.",3
19140,"The whitening effect is not huge, but it's there from the hydrogen peroxide.  Has a very fresh taste and cleans mouth well.",4
19141,Really works but does come out just passing your nailes.,3
19142,"This eye cream has been a longtime staple for me, but can't be found in stores anymore... It's creamy and hydrates my under-eye area.",4
19143,Of course it is a perfect item BUT THE COST AND RIP OFF cause me to only give it 3 stars.,3
19144,Did not see any change in my skin after using whole bottle.,3
19145,"I don't like fluffy washcloths and would prefer one that is thinner. These are okay, but actually too skimpy for me, threadbare in spots.",3
19146,"Thin material, typically sells at Walmart for 2.99. Not impressed",1
19147,"I wish the label was a different, it's hard to read. But otherwise  awesome!",5
19148,the powder brush was not as fluffy as I thought it would be but works fine,4
19149,"ok product, was a little to big for me but i can give as a gift",4
19150,"Whew!  These things shred my face to pieces!  Small price, but still a waste of my mula.  :-(",1
19151,"love them!!! the antiqued look is awesome, and now I can identify my bottles without having to pick up every one",5
19152,"One of corner of this case was foul when I open it.
But I like this color.
Maybe it will change color in several weeks.....",2
19153,Good product.  Happy to have found a place I can get it.,5
19154,"JUST TAKING IT FOR 10 DAYS, WAITING TO SEE AND FEEL RESULTS.OVER ALL, A GOOD PRODUCT, LOOKING FORWARD TO BEING GORGEOUS LOL!",4
19155,"it is leaking only in 2 weeks of use and it was trashed in 3 months, what a disappointment and waste of money",1
19156,"Takes up too much room and it's very noisy.
It is not forceful enough to remove food in between your teeth.",3
19157,"Smaller clasp than I expected, so it doesn't fit some collars.",4
19158,"It's light,ales my skin feel soft and refreshed, and it is evening my skin tone.",4
19159,"My mom loves your product.  Is there any way to use safer ingredients, with the same outcome.",4
19160,Works fine but takes up a bit of counter space.,4
19161,Harsh pieces of sh**. I would never recommend these to anyone. These blades give an unbelievable amount of nicks.,1
19162,"These are the first blades I have tried.  They offer great shaves on first go, but second use feels dull toward the end of the shave.",4
19163,"Not sure why people are crazy about this product, it did not work for me. I didn't like the smell either.",1
19164,"Some of the rings were missing stones, they are decent though especially for the price.",3
19165,I see no results from this product at all despite regular use.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.,2
19166,Causes vaginosis. Causes a naturally smelly vagina in the long run.,1
19167,I recieved the tapers but not the plugs. So I'm am not happy at all with this purchase. Thank you,1
19168,Not what I expected....did not care for it.,3
19169,clear coating but it really does not fight frizz but it does help seal hair,4
19170,The sprayer broke after a week but I love the formula.,3
19171,"It smells okay, I actually saw a little peeling, but no major changes. I used the whole bottle. It was a waste of money.",2
19172,One size fits all allows fingers to move down towards nails.,4
19173,Love this scrub!!!!!!!!,5
19174,"Smells good,and like the sparkles and color, but it's very dry.",3
19175,These blades are very sharp and that is what I wanted.,4
19176,this ring seems bigger than 5/16' sadly. still works though,4
19177,lots of pretty colors and its glittery the first time you wear it but then the glitter is mostly gone for future applications of the same color.,4
19178,Wanted something to reduce puffiness when awakening and found these.. They are wonderful and even help you sleep better as very soothing to the eyes,5
19179,Simply-stated and easy to wear! Great company to do business with!,4
19180,"There was already an extra bulb which came with the mirror, and these two extra were suggested.",1
19181,"Kind of cheap, and flimsy. Good for the price though. hard to see out of.",4
19182,"They do the job, I like the color, no complaints here. I am happy with my purchase I made on here.",4
19183,"I did not like these tips at all, they do not glue down very well, and pop right off when used. Very unsatisfied.",1
19184,I really thought it was one of the worst smelling things I have ever smelt. Maybe you will like it but I had to throw them away.,1
19185,"An old razor I've really loved, but expensive to replace the heads, maybe next time will buy a new razor.",4
19186,"Too flexible..not adjustable. ..too big  for my toes.  Great idea, but not great in reality.",2
19187,Disappointing. I expected the jet to be more powerful than it is. But it does remove food particles lodged between teeth,3
19188,This is a great product and solved my nose problems however 40 to 60 percent of the product is lost due inefficient dispenser.,4
19189,"AFTER 2 WEEKS USING IT, DOES NOT WANT TO STICKY ANYMORE. I KEPT SKIN CLEAN AS PER INSTRUCTIONS AND ALSO WASHED PAD AS INSTRUCTIONS.",1
19190,Perfect for stateboard!  It arrived fast. The length of hair is exactly what i need. I decided that i would order another one for practice.,5
19191,"Did not work, short in cord! Cant return!",1
19192,"Did not meet my expectations at all, especially in length.",1
19193,"Love this still using it.
Less dental work when I go see my dentist :)",4
19194,This did not work at all.  I could not get it to stay up on the tile or the glass in my shower.  Completely useless!,1
19195,Much different than the way it used to smell years ago.  Too overpowering!,1
19196,I purchased this to help with the deep pockets on my gumline and since using this it has made a difference and the pockets have gotten smaller.,4
19197,Very silky and smooth is the results I received after using the product.,5
19198,"In a recent comparison of 4 kinds of mint soap (looking for Christmas gifts), this came in a refreshingly respectful second.  Not bad.",4
19199,"Some blades are very aggressive, some not so much. Doesn't seem to be as consistent as some other blades I've used.",3
19200,Garbage - don't waste your money! SHREDS AND FALLS APART!,1
19201,Makes my skin feel great but a little too fruity smell,3
19202,"I love the large amount of razors for the cost. However, they do not come with a case to dispose of them in.",3
19203,not sure these really do too much to  help change bone structure but maybe that is not what they claimed to do,3
19204,Reliably good and long lasting electric shaver!  There is an adjustment  period of three weeks or so  for the razor to orient itself to the hair growth.,4
19205,"I adore this moisturizer.  It leaves a nice silky glow, best for dehydrated skin.",5
19206,I was hoping it would do a better job but it's much better than any other brand that I've tried,2
19207,They arrived on time and are just as discribed. Love all  the color choices. I would recommend to anyone who likes bling on their nails.,4
19208,"A very ""High tech"" shaving experience. I'm extremely pleased with my purchase.",4
19209,Extremely strong fragrance.  Not what I wanted.  Could appeal to others.,2
19210,"It does not have all the bells and whistles but gives a great shave.

Bob",4
19211,"First the button on the hand device, just stops the water  but it spills all over , it is not so quiet as it says",3
19212,I wasn't able to use it because the lid was broken at arrival so I just gift it before trying to use it,2
19213,"Works pretty well. Doesn't get the closest shave, but I guess that's not really the point of a trimmer.",4
19214,these are not the original sturdy duckbills that comes with the pump.  made of very thin material and can tear easily.,1
19215,Worked out great I have natural curly hair and like the iron to relax the curl.,1
19216,I like the cream.  But I do not like how it smells.,4
19217,"It came on time, and I like it a lot. If you have sensitive skin like me, you'll like this product.",4
19218,"Healing, soothing.  Great for dry hands and neck area.",5
19219,Would have given five stars but this is the 2nd 16oz bottle that I have purchased and has been open and leaked.,4
19220,"I used this product for several weeks and all it did was burn my face.
Smell good thou
I don't recommend it.",1
19221,Scrubber is good.  Man like scrubber.  I used on my elbows and knees and feet.  I'm soft now.,5
19222,"It's a great organizer, makes everything easy to find! Love the colour! It's a nice organizer for those small bags!",4
19223,This stuff smells strong and like man cologne. I was not a fan.,2
19224,Very good product. Does exactly what it designed to do.,5
19225,This tape works wonders. It holds in place. And it keeps my frontals flat.,5
19226,Love the color. The only reason I am not giving this 5 stars is because as it fades it leaves this weird residue on your lips.,4
19227,this is great for soaking in a relaxing tub it also makes a great scrub when mixed with your favorite essential oil and or lotion or shower gel,5
19228,Does not hold well... i had to go buy new ones from cvs and they worked perfectly,2
19229,"Good coverage just made break out terribly. I bought the color 208 which was the perfect color, just couldn't continue using it.",2
19230,really helped and the pain hasn't come back now for about 2 months.,4
19231,"O melhor produto que comprei nos ltimos tempos!
Sinto que realmente meus dentes esto perfeitamente limpos!
Minha famlia tambm adorou!",5
19232,I thought cheaper brands were better.  The smell is very bad,3
19233,Stayed at the Morris Inn and loved it so had to buy it!! Love the fresh scent!,4
19234,"I got the shower grab bars instead of shaver things.. How do I return and get what I need??
Marie",1
19235,"seems new. Pretty color. Only thing I noticed was that the blush was really powdery compared to my other Nars blushes, otherwise good.",3
19236,Great coverage for in-between hair coloring.  Gives a slightly sticky texture to your hair.,4
19237,Great fragrance.  Lathers well and lasts a long time.,4
19238,I little bit lighter than I expected. Probably won't buy again.,3
19239,"Awesome as I remember, liniment smell takes me back to childhood and works well.",5
19240,"I've been using on my face every night, and it make my face so soft.",4
19241,Love it! It smells great. I can't wait to use it!,4
19242,"Wouldn't mind a more comfortable handle area.
Maybe some sharper finger tips to scratch a little harder.
Long enough for tall people.",3
19243,"your only getting one pair, but your paying for 4",1
19244,Does what it supposed to do. Choice of several heads,4
19245,"Sorry, not a good product, i tried it and got a lot of irritation in my face , besides is not a good scent.",1
19246,"This came super early, which was very nice. The brushes themselves were in good condition and work well. They smelled really weird though. XD",4
19247,Would be better if it held my badger brush better. My brush falls off it easily.,3
19248,"This lipsticks last for a few hours, but after that it begins to crumble. So you will have to reapply it throughout the day.",3
19249,"Perfect Talc. Use everyday. Non scented, which I prefer.",5
19250,it starts to peel off in little pieces not a big fan,2
19251,"My second set and they're just ok.  The first set was excellent, these seem to not be as fine.",3
19252,"Lid cracked, wax doesn't melt fully, couldn't return it. Threw it in the garbage. Waste of money.",1
19253,I haven't gotten it yet because I ordered it today but I'm hoping it will be good for me to use,5
19254,The brushes are not great quality.  They wear down much too quickly and the sound is not the same as when I used my original brush.,2
19255,Love it! I had one of the cheap Japanese ones for years and this one is so much lighter/thinner and softer but still gets the job done.,5
19256,I bought this to go with a safety razor gift set for my boyfriend.  So far he loves them!  Clean and smooth shave!,5
19257,The button on the wand stopped working last month so now it is useless!,1
19258,Great soap with a good lather that doesn't try out your skin too much if you rise your face thoroughly.,4
19259,Leaves a bad taste after using it and does not make mouth feel fresh like the other mouthwashes from crest,1
19260,Not made well. Fell apart in a few uses.,1
19261,For the intense heat and sun exposure here in Las Vegas works great.,4
19262,"A simple kit for a youny girl. It is made in china, Has all the brushes, Cute but inexpensive .A girl will like it",2
19263,"Yes, it works well.  Big improvement on the blackheads on my nose especially.",4
19264,"Although this product works, it loses its adhesiveness too quickly.  I have used others that don't do that, and are cheaper.",2
19265,"My daughter loves these. They sparkle and are really cute. The ball does not twist or fall off easily, so that's a major plus!",5
19266,Very disappointed when I received the product it was out of date by three years!,1
19267,This is a good groomer that does everything it is supposed to do. It has many different grooming heads.,4
19268,Love that this is natural without all those chemicals and unnecessary extra junk.  Wonderfully thick and creamy lotion.  Softens and smells great.,5
19269,Batteries lasted about a year with light use. It worked well while it worked.,3
19270,Arrived on time just what the description said will buy again,5
19271,Smells like it was meant for the ladies. My wife wears it instead of me.,3
19272,they don't shave to close I have to keep going over the same place a couple of times.  Then it cuts me.,2
19273,"This Nars blush is great, long lasting and nice color. This is my third time buying it and I love it.",5
19274,used the whole bottle; didn't notice much improvement on the dark spots; gentle product,4
19275,"The year-old blades pulled the beard out of my face.  It was time to replace the blades.  Ah, much better!",5
19276,"Insist to use, the effect is very good, big noise, the brush head matching complete, the late high cost of replacement",3
19277,"Replacement blades are very high priced.  On average razor blades are said to have well over a 5,000% markup.",3
19278,"Tried this as a substitute for Josie Maran argan oil.  I don't like the smell, but the oil seems to be similar quality.",2
19279,It only worked for a week or two. The dog yard is pretty stinky now about two months later.,2
19280,"todo perfecto, gracias, excelente producto. todo excelente. perfecta toda la operacin, gracias por todo, excelente toda la operacin. todo bien",5
19281,Smells like floor cleaning fluid and does not moisturizer well.,1
19282,One works good the other was broke when i got it,1
19283,I love this product but within two months the button on the handle stuck and will NOT unstick lol - I'd still buy it again!,4
19284,"These were a good price and I like them, cheaper than at the store. I would purchase again in the future.",4
19285,The ends on this item are too large and they catch on any little thing .,2
19286,"Expensive yet cheap - the deodorant stick fell out halfway through using it up, which effectively doubles the already-high price.  Seems effective as a deodorant.",2
19287,Gift for my husband he uses it every day and loves it,4
19288,its an ok razor the head pops of very easy and the attachments don't want to come off and this razor is also like $30 at walmart,3
19289,"Exploded inside from the first use
And I wasted my time reading how to use it

Didn't last one day afterall",1
19290,My dog ate it but I used some of it before he got to it.  Smelled good and he didn't get sick!,4
19291,I can't start my car or open my house door without these. These key turners are necessities.,5
19292,With even a little bit of pressure these will leak fluid around the lid.  Don't buy them if you need things to stay dry.,1
19293,"Delivered on time and just as it was advertised, which has not always been the case.",4
19294,Great product. Been using this for years now with no issues.,5
19295,Very nice for the price. I was surprised at the quality and it looks great in the small bathroom.,5
19296,"Love the product, I enjoyed bringing out my nails, will buy from this stellar again, thanks for the great product.",5
19297,Not quite as heavy as hoped they would be but otherwise a good purchase!,4
19298,Very cute but a little disappointed because the anchor is backwards but can be easily fixed,3
19299,"Not very sharp at all. Can get about two poor shaves out of them before I have to change blades.
Won't buy these again.",1
19300,I rate this item 5 star and feel it flosses you teeth better than the waxed string.  I highly recommend this item.,5
19301,"The size on this is , about 2-3 sizes to small ...I hate paying for shipping crap back ...when it is not my problem",1
19302,Gets the job done but not a comfortable hold.. Too thin and kind of small.,3
19303,Love this face cream!  Perfectly moisturizing without that greasy feeling.,5
19304,I couldn't wait to get it because it became so hard to get a hold of.,4
19305,"Great spa pillow, suction cups works well, stays put. Fit my smaller tub perfectly.",4
19306,I would rather have it spray a consistent steady  water stream. The way it sputters when it sprays makes water go all over place.,2
19307,nice stuff and much less than clubman for $7 its a deal,4
19308,All I can say is deep cleaning and beautiful fresh skin during every use!,4
19309,"I like their products, but the Tea Tree body wash makes my skin so dry.  The other scents are great though!",3
19310,The magnet that is supposed to hold the necklace shut is the same polarity... So it can't close and is unusable.,1
19311,My girls complained that this deodorant is too greasy and left grease marks under their armpits in their blouses.,2
19312,I have used electric shavers for many years. It seemed that the design of this product should yield a better shave than traditional designs but it did not,2
19313,Was dry and hard as a rock when I got it in the mail. So sad :(,1
19314,I purchased this appliance on the recommendation of my Hygienist.  It seems well built and functions as it should.  Time will tell.,5
19315,Great stand for my shaver and brush. Adds a nice touch to any bathroom and it's a quality product; very well made.,4
19316,Great for those days when you eat meals with lots of garlic.  They really work.  No problems with digesting them or any other side effects.,4
19317,My husband could have blown on my hair and it would have dried faster.  It also turns itself off pretty quickly.  I returned it.,1
19318,A bit oily feeling and seems to make my hair dirty.  I don't have dry hair so maybe it would be better for someone who does.,3
19319,Product would not turn on after about 9 months. The batteries are not the issue.,2
19320,"This product helps to remove food where flossing can not reach. However, not as great as I had hoped.",4
19321,"work good but not as sharp as id like it to be , will try a few more and if its better ill rewrite",2
19322,I wish they are Bigger... Wasn't alot for the price,4
19323,It doesn't fit well if you have thick hair it slides off or is much too tight.,2
19324,Amazing coverage and a little goes a long way so don't put on too much! Also blends better with a beauty sponge!,4
19325,No lice since we started using this product & it was rampant at our school - firm believer and it smells great.,5
19326,Use this multiple times. Really was hoping that it work. It never did,1
19327,terrible quality.. looked like it was from a dollar store... couldn't even use... :(,1
19328,"Still advised to floss with a regular toothpick to get everything off, but this definitely can help clean your teeth.",5
19329,Aquaphor is the very best stuff for daily use and dry skin protection.,5
19330,"Not anything special, but they work. If you need a deep cleanse, this isn't it.",3
19331,"One item, not 4. Returning for a refund.",1
19332,This durag is Silk but the strings are not that long,4
19333,"best cream ever, the price has almost , if not doubled from 18 to around 32 dollars.  Great Cream any ways....",5
19334,"Very matte, but it's really drying tho and it smears off side of the lips",4
19335,It is perfect for trimming hair anywhere on your body.  You will not be disappointed with this purchase.,5
19336,I was hoping this would be easy to use but they are not.  they are like a sticker but harder to use,2
19337,i love this product for me for the beach.  a little too thick and greasy for everyday wear... but the beach protection is unbeatable,5
19338,Awesome doesnt damage the chair and fits perfect and doesnt loosen or fall off,5
19339,This is the best comb ever for a beard. Worth the money.,5
19340,I've used these for years.... Hard to find where I live so I orderded online....died sooner than normal... Bummer.,2
19341,"Pretty, but flimsy.  Takes some time to assemble & set up.",3
19342,One blade is all you need don't be fooled by the big name razor companys,5
19343,Horrible it fall apart on pieces of hair when I opened it.,1
19344,Left my already dry skin very dry may work on oily skin.,1
19345,"product isn't what is described, these are just white color pencils.",1
19346,not sure if these are more effective than old school floss but definitely less destructive to your gums,4
19347,This body groom works great. While you can use this in the shower I had much better results when using this in the dry.,4
19348,"After 3 short weeks, my lashes were back to their natural state.  Love this product!!",5
19349,"They are okay, glides on smooth but not very pigmented.",3
19350,Great product wish it was cheaper and tasted a bit better.,4
19351,Good product for curly hair. I prefer the light citrus scent of this line to the scent of the regular DevaCurl line.,4
19352,"Love this product. Smells good, low on chemicals and additives. Been using it for several months and I plan to stick with this.",5
19353,Really cleans all areas between teeth and under bridges.  A great tool for oral health.,4
19354,This is the best shaving cream!  And way less expensive than getting from beauty stores.  Non foam cream.  It's fantastic!,5
19355,"This was so tiny, I feel like I was deceived",3
19356,They're a pain but if you can get them on right they look good,4
19357,These are wonderful bath flakes and we all need more magnesium,4
19358,Didn't work as well as it was advertised to work,1
19359,Philips HQ55 great product was a hard to find. Glad I was able to find it but think it might have been open before.,3
19360,"Really cute, and the size was perfect.  My 13 year old niece loves it.",5

19362,great for the price but didn't glow in the dark,3

19364,It works really good for me but it certainly is a little dry,4
19365,I'm not very happy. I was expecting the real dried flowers but I got plastic one.,1
19366,Love this oil!  Great quality and perfect for a carrier oil for essential oils.,5
19367,"My wife and I decided to try waterpik as alternative to flossing. Seems to work well, and so far we have been using it daily.",4
19368,Still waiting to notice a difference in the dark spots on my face since using this item twice daily for several weeks.,2
19369,MY SKIN IS TOO DRY FOR THIS KIND OF MAKEUP.,2
19370,"Some of mine had split on the ends. This hurt my cuticles, but this works well for dipping in polish remover and wiping away excess.",3
19371,I like this lotion after swimming. My skin is not getting dried out. The smell is very nice.,4
19372,"I loved my bridal is a bit large but is very pretty, buy it for use in my wedding and the price is really very nice",4

19374,I love this Shampoo and told my friends about it.,5
19375,Wife didn't like them...said they didn't work on her bridge,1
19376,the acrylic cutter worked like a charm.  I just wish that I could find a manicurist that worked like a charm!!!,5
19377,Color wasn't as bright as I expected it to be.,4
19378,"I received the Purell NXT Dispenser, but did not receive the two NXT BIB 1000ml Refills. Had to look elsewhere to order them.",2
19379,"This is a good alternative to Serovital, which is significantly more expensive. I've used both, and I think this works just as well.",5
19380,"I thought with all those beautiful fragrant flowers in it I could use it as body fragrant, but it doesn't smell that good.",3
19381,The material is very bad. I don't like it at all.,1
19382,"I love this brand, but the product I received was not as pictured.",1
19383,"Does what it needs to, could be cheaper, but it works well for my husband's razor/brush.",4
19384,"(shipping) , and perfect for all skin types.. now 'am liking the skin result

19385,Shreds right out of the package. This is the second shipment I've had with the same problem. Switching to a competitor.,1

19403,My mother used this product all her life and lived to be 98!  I use it as a moisturizer.  Love it.,5
19404,It helps quite a bit for something that cost so little.,4
19405,I don't really like the taste of this mouthwash.  It isn't minty like other washes.  I don't really know if it works.,3
19406,Great product.  It helps to have in between going to my stylist!,5
19407,Helps a lot!  Got me through a rough time of clenching my teeth during sleep and my teeth were hurting.,5
19408,"Buy an assortment pack here first. If the Astra works for you, this is the best value purchase!",5
19409,"I like this soap, smells exactly the way I expected. Nice size bar. No problem about it. 100% happy",4
19410,Good value for the money spent.  You have to work a little harder for that close shave...but what the heck.,4
19411,The item does not adhere  to clothing very well. It's basically pointless to use this product. Very disappointing indeed.,1
19412,Received the bulb but it didn't work.  They should check to make sure that the bulbs actually work before they send them out.,1
19413,I previously used only bars of beeswax. These little pills melt much faster when I'm making my homemade concoctions. Good quality too.,4
19414,"Horrible! These gloves are so small, they are toddler size!",1
19415,Smells great and I have been wearing it for a week and still no luck.,3
19416,"Quality finish, heavy and long enough for a Merkur 23C",5
19417,"Easy to apply, great color. Doesn't stay all day though.",4
19418,"The mist has a strong lavender smell that's very refreshing, but I wish it would last longer.  Nice, cobalt blue spray bottle.",4
19419,I live in a mountain town and this is great for keeping my hair hydrated.  Lovely soft fragrance.,4
19420,They're good... but they evaporate kinda fast. Shaving with a clean razor everyday spoils you... (you get used to is fast),4
19421,Love the variety that each has to offer. They are silky and don't leave your skin feeling oily. A great starting sample pack for massages.,4
19422,Wow.  The negative reviews are right these blades are very poorly made.  Buyer beware you will need to hone the blade before you use it.,1
19423,Love this. Good material for carrying around. Only enough space for a couple binders though. Narrow space.,4
19424,My Gillette Mach 3 keeps falling out of this stand.  Other razors may be ok.,3
19425,Very over-drying for my face.  I passed it on to my husband and he isn't crazy about it either.,2
19426,After five shves it suddenly stopped without so much as a warning light coming on.,3
19427,"It came on time, as advertised, and in good shape. Thank you.",4
19428,I have a straight friend who is very handsome. I have notice that he behaves completely different with me every time I use this cologne.,4
19429,Very cute but super fragile. Not built to last to be honest. But they were cute while they lasted.,1
19430,1/3 to half my cones would not stay lit. This is the second time too.,2
19431,"It can do the job: clean my teeth. however, the noise made from this machine is so loud that my neighbors think im using a chainsaw",4
19432,I'm thrilled with this product. It's amazing. The smell is a little weird at first but then it becomes nice and almost rose scented.,5
19433,"This is a great product,and a great price.",5
19434,this product really works. Simple to use and takes a short amount of time for good results.,5
19435,"Good stuff for after deep muscle massages. Yellow stains wash cloths, however temporarily.",4
19436,Doesn't make hair as soft or ask quick as I would like.,3
19437,"Very comfortable vest, I really like it! But I only had it for about 2 months and the sewing at the neck line is coming undone.",4
19438,Ok. Guard keeps it from getting really close.  And its hard to use w/o the guard in sensitive areas.,3
19439,It does exactly what it is supposed to. Live it!,5
19440,Excellent product!  It really does work. Stays on and last nearly a month.,5
19441,I was was very unhappy with this product. Thank you. CeCe,1
19442,"was easy to hold on to, didn't slip out of my hands even when wet. I would use this and recommended it to anyone",4
19443,As good as the best American made product but not better and not worth the extra cost of shipping from England.,4
19444,"cute inexpensive bracelets.  A little lower quality than I expected, but for the price they are great.  Gifts for female family!",4
19445,"i don't think this version is as organic as they make it seem. It dried out my face, and then made my hair brittle",1
19446,The brush was not even pink it was silver and it's a tiny little purse brush!  I'm very disappointed,1
19447,I didn't like the color but seems to be a nice lipstick.,2
19448,The material that goes between the toes is very bulky. Not comfortable to sleep with them on and impossible to walk while wearing this product.,1
19449,"I have been using this for years with Maxius Serum.  They keep my hair straight and silky, more so than other products.",5
19450,"Wonderful product, refreshing and rejuvenating! Highly recommended daily mask - no problem for my sensitive skin.",5
19451,Lots of colors give plenty of variation but don't stay on as well as I'd hoped. One only made it 3 days:/,3
19452,"It is what it is, works, what more do you want?",3
19453,xmas gift for my niece. Bought a bunch of different cases for her. This is one of many but she does like it.,5
19454,Barely blows hot air. Not hot enough .Curl release doesn't work . Sorry not worth the price,1
19455,this is smaller than planned but is still a good product and will do what I need.,4
19456,"loved them, they are all so nice and seem like they will last a long time. they are cute and stylish!",3
19457,DO NO BUY!! The brush was broken!!,1
19458,Recommended by New York Times so purchased it and then returned it.  Ineffective and more expensive than regular drug store lines,1
19459,"Its good, not the best.  It works well for the purpose.",4
19460,"Can definitely tell my hair has not only thickened up, but grows faster as well!  Great company and great product!",5
19461,"Seems to be working fairly well.  The one we use in our children's room seems to leak occasionally, so that's a little disappointing.",3
19462,Seems to be very good quality. Love the variety of colors !,4
19463,These were extremely small.  Didn't fit my nose but love that it came with three of them and different metals.,3
19464,Very nice but on the lighter side.  I layer with oils because I'm super dry.  Love that it has peptides.,4
19465,"its tiny, in fact only good for  to  of your face + you need to be very close to see in wet foggy ambiance!",2
19466,"Huge mess, pouts leaked all over pakage, some items half full",1
19467,Best exfoliant I have used at home. Skin is very soft afterwards.,5
19468,"Eh, haven't noticed anything different about this product than I have in any of the others that claim to improve aging signs...",3
19469,This is cute and fit just fine but the bow fell off after a week. Grr.,2
19470,"Works nicely, and dried great under UV light. Not thick at all but sticky if you use to much.
Multiple compliments on nails.",4
19471,Dermatologist recommended this sunscreen. Works well since my skin tends to be oily with other sun screen products.,4
19472,"Great product, but leaks a little when placing water reservoir back onto body.  But, it does get my 9 year old to brush and floss better",4
19473,"I have been using a waterpik for many dozen years.  It got me through braces and periodontal cleanings.
Cannot do without one.",4
19474,Hair is nice and a little thin at the ends but good for stateboard,4
19475,I love this mask. Works great to keep light out and it's very comfortable.,5
19476,This doesn't do much for my edges but leave it oily .. not much hold,1
19477,Feels great and looks good. I will not leave home without it.,4
19478,Threat is to thin and sharp. It cuts my gums sometimes and it does not feel like they clean/remove the stuff in between the teeth.,1
19479,Ok sharp. The writings on the packing indicates it was intended for Arabic markets and it is not as sharp as one I used before.,3
19480,"Not easy for me to apply, but I think I just need practice. The process itself is simple.",4
19481,Smell was not what I wanted; Returning the item.,2
19482,nice name for a nice blush. This cream blush doesn't disappoint when it comes to giving me a  light hint of color on the cheeks.,5
19483,Works ok. Nothing super special but the smell is awesome.,4
19484,It's just like the one that came with the razor when I first got it. What more is there to say?,5
19485,Way too wide to fit between my teeth. I suppose this would work good if you have 1cm gaps between each of your teeth.,3
19486,Razors are getting too expensive and it seems like these do not last as long as some of the older gilette products,3
19487,Prolonged the life of a shaver and is smooth and durable.,4
19488,"I use this on myself, my kids and now my mother has taken a bottle back to India! High quality product.",5
19489,"I've used a similar product, like this brand much better",5
19490,I have used many different hair products and this is one of the best.  holds your hair without a greasy feeling.,5
19491,the colors were correct but it definitely was not 3000 count,3
19492,This product was for my son and he loves it.  It's easy to use.,5
19493,Cute headband. Awkward looking bow. The good thing is that it is removable so I did just that to be able to wear it.,2
19494,"Good sharp blades.  Better than Derby, not as good as Feather.  These do the job just fine.  Not sure what else to say.",4
19495,"works good, but should be a bigger role for the price",4
19496,"Did not work at all for me, and bleached everything even though I was careful to wash it off.",1
19497,"I cleaned and sterilized it, wore if for a day, and now I have an infection. BE CAREFUL.",1
19498,"Great product, however it cost way too much!  Therefore I did not give it a top rating.",4
19499,"Wish it wasn't ""sticky"" after spraying on my hair. Color was nice though",3
19500,It feels very dry. I started to use one week ago and I am not dissapointed. You can consider try it,4
19501,"It is good for facial hair,wont recommend for your body hair, the vacuum tube clogs up really easy.",4
19502,"The base colors are dried out, I can't get any color on the eyeshadow applicator. The lids colors are fine but I'm very disappointed .",2
19503,no improvement. i don't think so its minimize large pore like its claim.,1
19504,I have been using this for a couple of months and it seems to be working well. Comfortable and easy.,4
19505,The brushes are great just as describe the bag smells like plastic but not too bad and really good for the money,4
19506,This a wonderful product will definitely buy again!!!,5
19507,Our dentist has been recommending this product to us for awhile.  Have tried it a few times but not to impressed so far.,2
19508,"The color was too dark, the spray nozzle was hard to use and the can was very small. I will stick with my JKS.",1
19509,Great blade does seem to last longer than the Bic ones I was using.  Not the sharpest blades I have used though,4
19510,Does a nice job hiding my grey growth before my next color. Really blends in nicely.,5
19511,This has become my most favorite thing in my home.  Diffusing essential oils has never been easier and more affordable.,5
19512,"Great actual product, unfortunately the sellerwas not as great this time.",2
19513,"Hi, this product does not need anything else for coverage. Gives skin a nice smooth glow!  Just apply it after moisturing.",4
19514,Have used this product for the past 7 months. It has proven to be a great shampoo by improving the overall health of my hair.,4
19515,"It is very light yet holds a ton of water, so it does not feel substantial enough and takes a long time to dry out",3
19516,Awful product! Does not work as advertised. Chalky in appearance. Cannot get a refund as they do not allpow returns.,1
19517,"The item is exactly as described. The compartment box contains an assorment of small, cute gems for creating nail art.",4
19518,I really like this soap I use it on myself and also to clean with.,5
19519,Works  as good as any dental floss (I see no real difference in performance) but it does have a good taste,5
19520,i really like the way this works. It helps w/ wrinkles and helps pores appear smaller. I can't seem to find it anymore though,4
19521,Works as advertised. A little to rough for my gums gave away,4
19522,Gets the job done for my 9 year old!!!,4
19523,"This is not friendly to sensitive skin!
If you don't have sensitive skin, I am sure it will be OK",3
19524,Too light weight. Feels fake and also hot air not so strong.,2
19525,"Works, but has lead in it.  There's a lead-free version by the same brand",5
19526,"Has very little power and the Tangle Free title doesn't apply if your hair has any length, mine is just above my shoulders.",2
19527,Beautiful!!!! My daughter n I love it!!,5
19528,Operation is fine except it louses up the TV if you use it when TV is on.  That should be cleaned up by adding a line filter.,4
19529,"I have very oily skin so I decided to try the product, it made my skin more oily than usual.",1
19530,I use these cards for every occasion.  Beautiful and priced right.,5
19531,"This is a very good product.  Best floss I have ever used, in fact.  Too bad not available in Australia.",4
19532,Doesn't hold the straight-edge razor...too much work to return,1
19533,Not much to say. Looks good and price is good. Just as advertised it holds my razor and brush like it's suppose to lol.,5
19534,"It is a good product, but doesn't last as long as it should.",4
19535,I love them! Such a bargain compared to Sally's Beauty Supply Store.,5
19536,Fun Wear.....Cute over T-Shirts!  Difficult for me to clasp!,3
19537,Very poor quality.  Sheds continuously.  Throwing it out.,1
19538,My husband is thrilled with this product. Solved the issues that he was hoping to address.,5
19539,Got headache after using for a couple of days on my shaved bald scalp. Wasn't expecting that. I will prefer Navratna over this.,3
19540,Is ok not very impress. Is good size to have in you're purse all in one in case you need to re-touch.,4
19541,Easy to use but not nearly as good of reflection as shown in your ad.  Will not buy another one or anyone like it again.,2
19542,I use this at home and while traveling.  The individual packs are great!,5
19543,Not very impressed I thought it would work better.  Slow to work,3
19544,Perfect for travelling or if you just want to try the products. I love the moisturizer!,4
19545,There was no mention that this is extra thick and for people with wide-spread teeth.  I can't use it at all!,1
19546,I really like using this but I don't understand why it is so expensive.,4
19547,I'm not really happy with this product. I bought this and tried it and it feels pretty rough on my skin.,1
19548,Its pretty good. Not my favorite and doesn't cover like it says it does.,3
19549,Did not like this razor. Does not shave anywhere near as close as my Merkur Futur adjustable safety razor.,1
19550,I  do not care for black but they had they would pick the color so  got into that one falls off.,2
19551,"While the flossing part is good, the machine itself vibrates a great deal.  It hurts my hand.",2
19552,"WORKS GREAT, FINALLY WENT TO DENTIST, WISH HE USED IT.",4
19553,Very crumbly. I don't think it's raw shea butter.,1
19554,I have use this before and my makeup last all night long,5
19555,"This concealer doesn't cake or crease. It stays on long, like six or so hours. It's great!",4
19556,Thought this would be a miracle blush but I like Maybelline glaze better.,2
19557,"Not good quality ,mine started chipping color that very same day that i used it.",1
19558,"Wished it lasted a bit longer, but for the price you can't beat it. This along with sensitive toothpaste has really helped my teeth",4
19559,Very good product for fine/thin hair.  Does help with texture and thickness.,4
19560,the stones are very tiny and you don't get an equal amount of all the colors. but they do come in pretty colors,3
19561,Two of the brushes were broken when I received them and the rest are loose. It was glued poorly to say the least. Very disappointed.,1
19562,The case doesn't hold the tablet in place. The tablet slips out even when you go to close the case. Not good.,1
19563,Haven't used them all yet but so far so good.,4
19564,Very small.  Acrylic is showing signs of cracking after only one month of use.,4
19565,I use it for doing my nails. It's awesome.,4
19566,Using daily must be cautious or it clumps. Smells fine to me. Just waiting to see reaults,4
19567,I love the barrette It was soft enough to bend and catch loose hair but strong enough to hold my thick hair in place! I love it!,5
19568,This crap gave me a rash I wouldn't recommend it to anyone,1
19569,Tangles hair easily as the release function does not always work.,2
19570,i bought this in august 2014.it's already broken December 2014,1
19571,foil broke after couple days  Just  bad  luck  on my part and I will have better luck when I reorder,2
19572,Nice scent.  Not overpowering.  Works like I expected.,4
19573,Enjoy the smell of the product but it actually left blisters on my skin. Tried it twice over a two week time period - same results :(,3
19574,These are cute brushes but on the one all the hairs came out! :( Everything else was good though.,2
19575,not quite deep enough for some shaving soaps.  Otherwise it is stylish and works well once the soap has had a chance to dissolve a litte.,4
19576,If you are tall find something else.  I should have returned. Use it once in awhile.,3
19577,When I received this item the quality looked really cheap so I returned it.,2
19578,Gets really messy but it works great.  Bring extra towels.,4
19579,"Do not buy, only lasted 3 times before it stopped working.red light on showing plenty of water but no mist",1
19580,Love it. It massages the gums as well as gets the food out if the hardware. I would recommend it to anyone with braces,4
19581,Bought this product as a gift for my brother. Says it works and that he likes it. Doesn't dry out his skin.,4
19582,"I thought it was a bargain price, but it actually cost more than if I had bought it locally.",3
19583,"I was a little disappointed,  I thought the ring expanded. It does not fr my finger.",3
19584,The product is good and I am satisfied. Thank you,4
19585,I recommend this shaver even though they discontinued  making the models,3
19586,"Great product, however I found some in Wal-Mart even cheaper. My next purchase will come from Wal-Mart.",4
19587,"a bit noisy and vibrates. Depending upon your water hardness, it must be cleaned regularly. Wish there was an attachment for cleaning ear wax.",4
19588,Hubby really likes it and he likes the fact that he can rinse it under water and clean it that way.,5
19589,"I THOUGHT THAT THE JET STREAM WOULD BE JUST A BIT STRONGER. BUT IT DOES THE JOB. PRICED WELL. :)
THANX",3
19590,"Big and shapeless, not comfortable around the shoulder and sleeve areas.....well, it's cheap enough, and perhaps can use over a bathing suit.",1
19591,I really like this but the bad part is it last only about 8 or 9 days and that's it!,4
19592,"I liked the size, but it lacks longevity. Within months, the stitching feels apart and the bonnet was detached from the band.",4
19593,I guess this works (I don't use it but my wife does).,4
19594,"shipped very quickly
price was fantastic
I didn't notice any difference after using the full bottle
i wouldn't recommend this to my friends",3
19595,Been using it twice a day for four months. Black heads still there.,1
19596,"The waxing is EXTREMELY sticky and takes some scrubbing to come off, even with baby oil.",4
19597,I really like this stuff. Not to greasy but has a nice hold. Smells good to.,4
19598,Only one clear stone in the whole pack - majority were pink and black.,3
19599,"Great product, but mine came with multiple cracks in the bottom, so many so that I threw it out. Packaging needs to be better",2
19600,"Nice and rich without being greasy.  Soaks right in.  (Fair, combination skin.)",5
19601,"Good quality, I have gone through one pack (there are five in each) and so far very pleased. Good shave, no irritation.",4
19602,"there light bulbs what can I say , if they light there good",5
19603,These pens were defective.  A very disappointing birthday gift.  Half of the pens were unusable!,1
19604,great value for money but not so convenient process of refilling water (bulky). the design needs to be more efficient,4
19605,I loved the unit but it stopped working after five months.,1
19606,"It gets the job done without leaving any nicks or cuts, but it really doesn't do a good job on contours.",3
19607,It gives a close shave which my husband likes.  He is very pleased with this shaver.,4
19608,These look really nice for a modern look.  They work well but do not seem to last very long.,4
19609,Hi setting stopped working in just 6 months after purchase. Would not recommend.,1
19610,I have used this brand before and liked it. However the product arrived damaged and unusable.,1
19611,These gems are so colorful and has different shades of a color. They are the perfect size not too small and not too big.,4
19612,It makes my skin really soft but i haven't noticed anything else.,3
19613,"After nearly two months of continued use, I saw NO effects whatsoever.",1
19614,"I made a video review & demo for the Aquafresh White Trays! Check it out here:
[...]",4
19615,Worth every penny and very good material. I have used over and over again and still looks and feels like new,5
19616,"it did not seem this was pure 100% cocoa, it was dry.. it was okay but not great.not really happy",3
19617,I bought it for my friend. She said it was worthy!,5
19618,Received the bottle with one pill/capsule open and have only ordered this product twice.,2
19619,"My item was about 21""x 10' .  i was very disappointed because  l liked the layout. I just needed the space that was advertised.",2
19620,"love it, --also great for an eyebrow powder in the darkest color!!",5
19621,Okay - didn't find any difference in my hair after using this kit several times.....,3
19622,"They do just what they say they will, I plan to buy more of them. Just love this product.",5
19623,Waited a month for them to arrive and smaller than a 18 gauge. Really disappointed!!,1
19624,"This is ""acceptable"" for the price, but I really prefer Florida Water;  This has a slight ""greasy"" feel...",3
19625,Have used this product for the past 7 months. It has proven to be a great shampoo by improving the overall health of my hair.,4
19626,"Meh,  it used to be alot more potent and i felt squeaky clean,  i just feel so-so clean now.... Like its been watered down.",4
19627,Overall I'm quite satisfied with this shaver. The only complaint I have is it takes a bit long (8 hourse) to fully charge.,4
19628,"Works well. If you want, cut bag off and use clamp for weeks with little or no leakage",4
19629,"Cheaply made. But was very inexpensive, so no problem.  Will wear until it falls apart.  I would not purchase any more.",2
19630,Very noisy... sounds like a motorcycle coming down the road. But it does not leak like my old one so I can live with it 4 now..,3
19631,You get what you pay for.  Tiny and cheaply made.,2
19632,bahaha this doesnt keep your hair dry at all. just a headband. save your money.,2
19633,The top beads break and fall off!!!!!,1
19634,I've been using this product for sometime. I received a sample with something I purchased and have been using it since.,5
19635,great smell & natural oils...works great with my texture of dreadz..size could be a lil larger but its a good buy,5
19636,"This product is great for mending broken and cracked nails, but it is a little difficult to cut the silk to the right size.",4
19637,"Maybe I'm using it incorrectly or something, but I find my regular dental floss much more effective. . . .",2
19638,This is one of the only things that has made my skin feel someone comfortable.,5
19639,Disappointing. I'm an older woman maybe it works on the young,2
19640,"Please don't get this one, I only gave it a two because you do get a lot for the price.",2
19641,"Although the design is really cute it is super flimsy, the antler broke the first day I had it.",2
19642,Cheaply made and does not heat up much. I guess you get what you pay for. Worthless.,1
19643,Its ok....not sure I saw any benefits. Latisse still t he best prodouct,3
19644,Left light brown hair with high lights  nice and shiny but no sign of pink.,3
19645,"This is a ""mini"" size brush. I didn't see that in the description title.",2
19646,Extremely smaller than expected and didn't even get one of the four bars i was supposed to get. Complete rip off,1
19647,"Pretty, but the magnet isn't strong enough to hold it closed.... Dissapointed....",2
19648,I see some growth but it hasn't been a month yet,3
19649,"I love Ponds products, however this came without a box and the container it self had no seal, so I will not use it.",3
19650,Works works great in both Florida and Australia for long surf sessions,5
19651,"IN JAPAN,THE PRICE OF THIS ITEM IS NOT SO EXPENSIVE, BUT THE ITEM IS SO GOOD AND I LIKE IT.",4
19652,Getting the replacement head pack make my shaver work like new.  It works very well.  This is far cheaper than buying a new shaver,4
19653,shaves close! holds charge.  need to have much longer  to see if reliable.,4
19654,"Fair product. Had better results with TruSkin, which actually did improve the circles under my eyes.",3
19655,Does the job! Would be better with a dropper for easy use. Consider please.,4
19656,These are not top of the line but they were just perfect for my needs and the price is exceptional!,4
19657,Ugg. they are cheap.  I don't use the one I Bought.  I ordered a color and received ugly black.,1
19658,Aveeno's is a lot more hydrating but I mix the two and it leaves my skin so soft and moisturized!,4
19659,"It's great, but it's not as easy as I thought it would be.
Water flashes everywhere and I have to wipe them off.",4
19660,So far I have enjoyed the Waterpik it seems to operate as it should no complaints so I would recommand it,4
19661,The spray hose did not work so I poured it into an empty bottle.,3

19664,"easy to use. not too loud. steady. various devices for mouth, teeth, tongue, and gums. easy to clean and store.",4
19665,Works ok...takes awhile to heat up. I wouldn't buy it again.,3
19666,Always used this item for years. This price beats the warehouse clubs and brick & mortars so I will be ordering on Amz from now on,4
19667,This is an excellent product.  It cleans your teeth and invigorates your gums,4
19668,These blades work excellent for me. I can get 7 shaves per blade. Great value for money!!!!!,5
19669,"See the site Skin deep cosmetic safety database product report.
[...]
Conducts animal testing.
Try Soleo organic sunscreen.
Highly rated.",1
19670,Great deal. Much cheaper and far better blades than the CVS ones I had been using.,5
19671,Once again your product was above expectations.  It arrived well before schedule.  My friends are going to love these gifts.  Thank you,5
19672,But i didn't see a difference in my skin.,2
19673,"Pic shows a table that states ORGANIC and the bottle I received is not organic. Just like the other reviews, misleading!",2
19674,Unnecessarily big and doesn't fit the safety I have from art of shaving,1
19675,Very Bad Product. I had to cut it out of my hair. It doesn't deserve (1) one star.,1
19676,"First the button on the hand device, just stops the water  but it spills all over , it is not so quiet as it says",3
19677,OK MOISTURIZER.I HAVE VERY DRY SKIN.IT DIDN'T REALLY HELP.IT DIDN'T BREAK MY SKIN OUT LIKE MOST MOISTURIZERS.,3

19680,"Huge problem as I live in Australia and the voltage is not correct, even with a converter - just sits in the cupboard taking up space",3
19681,"Very adorable, My wife loves it.  Very quick delivery from China.  Priced accordingly",4
19682,Reservoir to small must refill alot. Didn't live up to Hype. Would not purchase if knew all the facts that simple.,3
19683,Just needed one for over night conditioning treatment.  They are SMALL.  I have super short hair and a small head so perfect for me.,3
19684,Good fragrance...not as moisturizing as I would like.,4
19685,"I love this, lots of colors to choose from.  There are two cases and they are a great size to fit in your purse or bag.",5
19686,I don't see the attraction to this brand. It looked so fake when I put it on. I just prefer a more natural look.,2
19687,Hate that the water floss head moves. I have to hold it down with my index fingers and thumbs to position. Can't just use the handle,3
19688,"After the second time i used this, it started smelling bad (like mold or something):(",1
19689,The product works great but when it arrived the safety seal was broken and the bottle was leaking slightly and now the lid does not fit securely.,3
19690,A good convenient alternative to Gillete mach3 during a travel. It's my first time to use electric razor and I feel slight itch after shaving.,4

19692,It wasn't the color I expected but I love it on,4
19693,Helped a little. I am using before whitening to help with sensitivity,4

19703,Leaves your skin smooth and fresh feeling not wade down like others I have tried in the past.,5
19704,Really nothing spectacular about these blades. They definitely full quicker than other brands and don't cut as clean.,2

19706,Took 20yrs to get and they are really small nothing like the picture the colors were repeats,1
19707,Easy to use and does not irritate skin. I had to replace my first one within a year but inexpensive enough not to worry.,4

19709,Very nice stand! Just what I was looking for.,4
19710,I've been trying out shampoo bars over the last year this is a decent bar smells pretty good and leaves my hair feeling nice and clean,4

19712,Is sticky like a bandaid so it can hurt when taking off.,4
19713,It got here pretty fast. But the brushes were really cheap. The bristels were falling out. And were all over the pakage.,1
19714,The time frame was long but the product is nice for the price.,3
19715,the colors are so dull and perhaps the gems are too tiny.. some of the colors were mixed with others.,2

19717,This is great prevents rash and is a great moisurizer!,4

19723,great product. I definitely notice I sleep very deeply when I take 2 before bed.,5
19724,The cost of blades is higher that the fusion blades. Just felt that the fusion blades lasted longer that these proglide blades.,4

19731,The smell is horrible. If I could give it zero stars I would.,1
19732,"Doesn't prevent sweat as much as the chocolate powder, but it smells good and taste great. I'd definitely buy more",4
19733,"It is refreshing, gentle with a reasonable price. But u need to avoid using it around the eye area if you have sensitive eyes.",4
19734,"Good product. Creamy formula. Better than the Rimmel Show-off / Apocalips in longevity. However, it does wear off within 3-4 hours and eating.",4
19735,Makes my skin feel amazingly elastic and soft. A little goes a long way. Pricey but definitely worth it! LOVE IT!,5
19736,Love love love. I've got sensitive skin and I dislike a lot of scents but this smells amazing and takes care of me.,5
19737,"I really like it, but one of the strand is broken. I love the color, but it's kinda of to big for my tiny wrist",4

19739,My Mom's favorite lotion. Will forever have to keep buying it lol,5

19742,Caused rash across whole body. DO NOT use on face straight away. Try small patch first.,1

19744,Strip slid around On gums and so up or not seat or keep contact with area needed.,1
19745,... they are nice but the bristles are not the softest. She does have the skin of an angel though...,3
19746,Definitely not shoulder length. More like a few inches above my elbow length.,2
19747,I love these when they work. Unfortunately they fail rather quickly. Both of the products that I purchased failed in less than 60 days.,1
19748,Best hair product ever; thanks.  Second time around ordering; one for my sister and one for me.  Would give as a gift.,5
19749,"I was not pleased with this product as it  does not adhere the way it should, nor work the way one expects",2
19750,The handle on this brush broke after a short time.,2
19751,This product is sort of working- just like lotion sort of works.,3
19752,They clean the blades pretty good but they don't last a long time,3
19753,"My wife uses it, as it is only hair product that makes her curly hair nice and smooth.",5
19754,"Does the trick for my 94 yr old Mom! She says its prices too high, but otherwise great.",4
19755,"Smells nice, but didn't really produce as many bubbles as I expected compared to other products I have used. :(",3
19756,Using this was like having a fire hose in my bathroom.  I just never got the knack of it.,1
19757,Smells great and feels great.  Don't know what effect it will have on my skin in the long-run.,4

19761,"only got all gold, fit nice tho. if you have larger lips won't be quite good for that",3

19787,"it was ok, You really have to wait for it to work meaning next bottle might work.",3
19788,Not large enough for the money. It comes off like any other scarf. Nice material,1

19790,"Very soft and generally great, just took a really long time to arrive",4
19791,This cakes very badly. Maybe my lips are just too dry for this product?,2

19799,It didn't stop my baby girl from sucking her finger,1
19800,Great coverage but shades r off! I mix with oil and my foundation. Good to use as a councelaer. Coverage is great!!,4
19801,bad and too thin holder and handle...would not recommend,1
19802,"I use this product because there is no other one availible, but it still has to much perfume in it!",2
19803,"Unsure what this does, other than lubricate the needle to help it glide on the skin.",3
19804,These gloves ripped in a matter of a few uses. Would not buy again.,1
19805,I make my dentist happy by flossing nightly and the milt is just the right of ming,5
19806,The battery died after 1 use. Does it mean it's broken? I don't see an opening to replace the batteries...,1

19808,"I got this timely, however, my first time  wearing it the big black rhinestone fell out. Wore it once",1
19809,As with my other review of a similar band this one is cute and functional but does take awhile to ship and arrive.,4
19810,It barely works. Doesn't cut well at all.  Not a good investment. Replaced it with a $15 Conair trimmer and am much happier.,2
19811,So tiny in width- unrealistically narrow- even for 34 A !,1
19812,made of brass not worth your good money!!!,1
19813,Good product ...even got a free extra bottle unannounced. Pretty cool!,4
19814,The bristles do not provide enough friction.  Feels like they are just gliding over teeth.  Will not buy  this again.,2

19819,i still got tiny brown spots on my hands even with the gloves,1
19820,as previously reported there is a mold problem with the WaterPik Flosser and I did have mouth sores which I believe  came from this product,1
19821,Great color. Bought as a Mac Media copy. The application is somewhat choppy. I just smooth it out and wear it anyway.,3
19822,"Great little kit to carry with you for touchups throughout the day or night.
Fantastic value for the money",4
19823,I bought this as a gift and I've been told it's wonderful! Even better than the 7110x that the person originally wanted.,4
19824,"Just ok, not very impressed.  Too many steps to follow.",3
19825,"I LOVE MY STOVE. It came right on time, and i mean that literally... i have yet to put it back in the box",5
19826,I would give 5 stars but the item was expected on 1/7/15 and arrived a week later. Otherwise a great blush for medium brown skin.,4
19827,"Made well, but very small holes for even my small fingers.",3
19828,they work but i have dry patches on my skin now that burn after using these ....,3
19829,i would never recommend this item because i didn't get more then 1 clip and it claims set of 3,1
19830,Awesome product...definitely helps you stay dry. All my guy friends and brothers are getting this for Xmas,4
19831,The temperature does not get as hot as I would like.,3

19833,"Didn't work for me, tried to glue down a wig,  was unsuccessful.  Maybe other this it would work for but not wigs",1
19834,I used manic panic when I was younger and it worked so much better. This light pink didn't stick to my daughters hair at all.,1
19835,"You don't get the same ones as the color , also mines broke easily , and Also they lost color the second day",1
19836,They are good and serve the purpose they are ment for. Just a little bummed that you have no say in the color.,3
19837,Colors are matt and gorgeous - will order from this company.,5
19838,"An okay product for me (someone with thick, dark hair). A great product for someone else (someone with thinner, lighter hair).",3
19839,I use this every day (sometimes twice) and my nails have become noticeably stronger after about 6 months.,5
19840,This stuff is the best. Unscented so you don't get that cheap cologne feel that you do from most other brands.,5

19846,"My cat ears came in the mail and when I opened my package, the headband was broken.",1
19847,Pretty good concealer in a pretty good color. Won't completely hide grays. Small bottle goes fast.,4

19849,"Tried the product:
 I followed each step of the instructions
 Hair still remains AND my skin is red, irritated, and burns. #awesome :(",1
19850,"Save your money, doesn't help with acne at all",1
19851,cute but not as nicely made as shown in the picture,4
19852,"Works well, but can't really tell if it gets rid of bumps.  Will keep trying it.",4
19853,"Replacement heads are very easy to change.  They work
just as good as the original heads.",4
19854,"I think this is a awesome razor, but the replacement razors are expensive.",5
19855,I wear it in my nose and the following day I had pus and all red and swollen,1
19856,Very VERY soft brushes. But unfortunately mine broke easily. But worth the price.,3
19857,These are great card sleeves and they came on time but like every sleeve they are extremely slippery and they fit well on my cardfight vangaurd cards.,4
19858,"Too much money for a roll of tape.  However, it is what I needed and works fairly well.",3
19859,"it should have a warning label not to wear white pants after use,I just ruined a good pair of pants",1
19860,"Great for your gums and teeth.

Easy to use.

Powerful.",5
19861,"Much lighter weight than the old WP-100.  The unit is extremely loud, and the motor has a dragging sound when shut off.  Very displeased.",1
19862,"It did nothing to take away the odor. I will not purchase again. So there you have it, my rating.",1
19863,"It is a superb night cream for the price.

I just purchased my second jar.",5
19864,The product is fine I just need you to get back the 1-1/2 inch barrel. does Helen of Troy make this any longer?,1

19868,Like the color but a little too glittery for me.  I'm still using it though.,4
19869,Haven't tried it yet> Just assume that it will be as good as it's advertized to be. I got my fingers crossed,4
19870,"Best hair cutting scissors I have owned. This is not my profession, but these are one of the most efficient tools.",4
19871,"There is a learning curve to using this product.  My hairdresser gets nice results -- me, not yet.",3
19872,"We were very pleased with this item, its just as beautiful as the picture.  Fit very well on my daughters head.",5
19873,it will not hold a charge.  it did ok for 1 week. but after that now won't last thru 1 shave.,1
19874,The tip of the belt came unclamped due to such soft/cheap metal,1
19875,"The lipstick is easy to apply and is cheap, but it's also not that long lasting.  The color is also lighter and brighter than expected.",3

19878,"put a ton of soap on it, and after rubbing your arm there is no more soap

should be bigger cause a man is bigger than a women",1
19879,Heavy and greasy. Not a huge fan. Prefer a cream.,3

19893,"It's a very beautiful product, only had a tiny detail: one of the edges was a little twisted. The rest: two thumbs up!",4
19894,I was sent the wrong item.  I was sent HQ55 instead of HQ55Plus.  Had to send it back.  Still need the HQ55Plus.,1
19895,"Beautiful colors, but you need thick long hair to use it.",3
19896,"I expected a thicker consistency, but, overall satisfied.",4
19897,These broke the first time we tried to use them in a difficult lock. Very cheap and useless.,1

19906,"skin lotion, very good but should give a try to the sunscreen one!",4
19907,Great product for between colors. Doesn't run or come off until you wash your hair.,5
19908,Great Price but not as good as more expensive blades. The blades are individually wrapped in paper envelopes. This makes they tricky to open sometimes.,3
19909,Love it. It made my hair more manageable and shiner...,4
19910,The glue takes awhile to dry and it doesn't turn clear,2
19911,"This item works as advertised, but I think I could have spent the same by buying it at Target.  Quick delivery!",4
19912,Strong mist if required and the light show is impressive! Nice product!,5

19916,"They work as designed.  They are a better buy here than at wallmart.

I need seven more stupid words to finish this.",4
19917,Very pricy product.  Replacement blades cost more than I paid for the razor.,4
19918,Perfect nude polish!!! Love this polish!!!,5
19919,Best razor out there for the money. These are cheap enough to that I only use a blade twice and swap it.,5
19920,"It's nice looking packaging, but it stopped working after the first week.  I opened the top and the screw top was shattered.",1
19921,Good product which should be improved by the manufacturer to provide a better grip.,4
19922,"Works well enough, but doesn't cut near as close as I had hoped it would. It's quiet and easy to clean.",3
19923,Meets my needs. I would like a stand with a slightly larger razor slot to accommodate modern razor (Gillete)designs.,4
19924,I have used this tangle free hot air brush  for many years and for my fine hair it performs well,5
19925,"This product has changed tremendously.
In my opinion it no longer have you feeling refreshed.",1
19926,"I find this always provides complete coverage of my undereye circles, without feeling heavy.",5
19927,"Causes Hypertension, although the ingredients are good, could be well compensated with a good multivitamin. Had no effect on the hair loss at all",2
19928,"We bought these for a costume. They are a lightweight and look kinda cheap, but they were, so no harm done. Perfect accessory.",4
19929,Fast shipping. Great item and service. Comes with everything on the picture exactly. I love this big time!,5
19930,"IT HAS BEEN WORKING VERY WELL SINCE I HAVE IT, I LIKE TO RECOMMEND IT TO OUR FRIENDS. THE ONLY THING IT IS MISSING USB RECHARGERBILITY.",5
19931,"The lines are too thin, they can't fit into the slots to clean the residuals there",2
19932,Sets up the skin very well. The smell is not as offensive as other lubricants.,4
19933,This trimmer pulls hair unless you use it VERY slowly. I will be replacing it with the model my husband uses to trim his facial hair.,1
19934,Purchased for my 3.5 year old. Does not fall off in the middle of the night. Works well for kids and adults.,4
19935,"Okay, when I saw this product, I just had to buy it.  All I can say is this stuff works!",5
19936,"smells wonderful.  from another customer,  she cuts the bar in half.  I think I will try this.  will order again.",5
19937,Great everyday color for year round. Great mixing color.,5
19938,Wonderful product! Smells divine and makes the skin so soft.,5
19939,The warmer is perfect! The wax not a favorite but ordered honey wax instead,4
19940,It is a little noisy but I heard all water like are noisy.,4
19941,I like the results I have gotten with this product. It is moisturizing and has a nice orange fragrance. It makes my skin feel firmer.,4
19942,I have short hair.  the cord dosen't rotate when I turn the brush very well. Not so good for me.,3
19943,Great flatware in classic pattern. Bought a set a year ago which still looks like new after many dishwasher cleanings.,5
19944,"Olay Body Wash, Daily Purifying, with Sea Salts & Microbeads does exactly what it says...it cleanses and moisturizes.  I love it.",5
19945,"Its a good souvenir but the fitment could be better
Buy it on sale only don't spend $10 maybe a few bucks",3
19946,"Actually this seemed old. Strange taste, I threw it away.",2
19947,This is the best salve; I have used it for years.  It only takes a little bit so it lasts a long  time.,5
19948,It's perfect... but the magnet is not strong...,4
19949,Paint came off of bar when I cleaned it before using.,1
19950,there is no any 1 Razor blade refill (Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch Men's Power Razor With 1 Razor Blade Refill And 1 Battery ),1
19951,"Good buy.
This holds enough liquid to thoroughly claen your teeth, and has every attachment conceivable",4
19952,THIS LIP STICKY IS TERRIBLE YOUR LIPS WILL STICK TOGETHER  NO GLOSS OR SHINE,1
19953,Very dull cutting edge.  I would not recommend this product.,1

19955,I like the color and the quality is quite good for the price,4
19956,Such a beautiful lip color! I'm gonna order more!!!!,5
19957,"It is the second purchase I do these, but this, the kufi cap are smaller and the material not is cotton as the first purchase.",2
19958,Ordered in June 2015 and it's broken. Lasted 15 months. Not happy.,2
19959,It's a scam it does t work and the smell is awful,1
19960,It is really a great product. Does what it promises! just a remark for the blades... they not that strong.. I already break one tooth.,4
19961,"This was a lot smaller than pictured, but just as beautiful.",4
19962,My aunt loves it!  I will get her some more when she runs out.,5
19963,"Did not fit between the toes, like I  had hope!",2
19964,The flash piece was broke off and unfixable so I was disappointed. It was a gift and had already came a month after the birthday.,2
19965,"Love it, clean my puff very well!
Will buy it again",4
19966,"Didn't really care for it, if dries your skin",3
19967,"Great for short hair or for curling closer to the scalp.  The ""bristles"" are plastic and about 3/16"".",4
19968,The product has so much alcohol that it almost suffocated me. I can't use it.,2
19969,The button gets stuck which is annoying.  Otherwise the product works as intended.,3
19970,I see no improvements from using this product.  Overpriced.,2
19971,This is the second time Ive ordered this product and each time its come unsealed / already opened with some missing.,1
19972,Feels like cheap plastic but it works. I have no problem with mine. Not good for heavy duty pedis but everyday grooming needs it fine.,3
19973,This was good but not as hard wearing as I would have like did the trick til I bought an otter box,2
19974,"Had been looking for this around stores with no luck, was able to order here and I really like it.",5
19975,I am a NARS fan and I love this blush! Terrific color! Use it every morning and it stays all day.,5
19976,"2 stars for fast shipping , the color is kinda different and it doesn't stick so good to shoe",2
19977,didn't like the smell and the cream was like liquid.  Wouldn't buy again for the price I paid.  Not thick enough.,2
19978,"Great, but get the GEL version. This kind separates.",4
19979,"Although I have been using this product daily for the past month, there has been little improvement.  A very expensive experiment!",1
19980,Unfortunately I accidentally ordered the wrong color. I meant to order Black/Dark Brown.,1
19981,This is very thin and just suitable for facial wash. I wouldn't recommend to remove makeup.,4
19982,I get a lot of hair pulling with this...ouch!,1
19983,I use Argan oil for my beard. Feels great!,5
19984,"The bikini shaper and trimmer works quiet well for trimming the bikini area and more, definitely makes grooming way easier.",4
19985,I'm sure there are more expensive and better ones- but it does the job and I am very happy!,4
19986,Good product. Smooths frizzy hair [from using bleach] and never looks oily.,4
19987,I'm not convinced this works at reducing cellulite. I lift 6 days a week. Maybe I'm just genetically predetermined to have cellulite =(,2
19988,"Excellent product. Eliminates a lot of the pain when arthritis is bothering your hands, easing the  pain involved in opening doors with a key.",4
19989,This product was just ok. It left my face feeling dry. I wanted to live it but I had to use another moisturizer with it.,3
19990,Would have rated 5 stars but the lid was cracked. Everything still works though!,4
19991,I have purchased this from other places also and I really like this color on me. I get many complements when I wear it.,4
19992,Great product!! It even gently removed make up and mascara easily.,4
19993,they look really cool but they left a scab on the out side of my lip,4
19994,Great brushes. Good quality. To ship to New York it took a month.,3
19995,It was a good price for the quality. Close shave for an electric razor. The charge lasts for many days of shaving.,4
19996,"I like this product, but need to order new brush heads.  You don't seem to have them available.",5
19997,I love this frickin deoderant and can never find it in the stores. So I'm REALLY happy I found this four pack on Amazon!,5
19998,"Yup took about a month  and a week , but it's all good other than the wait , these are great and good quality.",4
19999,the kids don't like t ouse after one day morning. So I cannot getit more than three star.,4
20000,I like these sticks. They slide into my hair easily.  I use them all the time. I just wish they were a little shorter.,4
20001,I really enjoy the fact that the razor is clean every time I use it.,5
20002,Started to fall apart within the first week of use.,2
20003,#32 isn't as bright red as I thought but overall good product very matte and kinda dry though,4
20004,I've never used nipple covers before but I don't think these are sticky enough. They're okay but I probably wouldn't buy these again.,3
20005,It was not as I had expected it to be. Masking tape would probably work better. It was a waste of money!,1
20006,II had a Waterpic flosser in the past that was better than this one but this is OK and meets my needs,4
20007,"Bought this for my grandmother who needed something light weight, and she loves it! Easy to set and collapse, and it was shipped quickly.",5
20008,Thought this would be a miracle blush but I like Maybelline glaze better.,2
20009,Now if they just straightened my teeth! This thing is the best.,5
20010,Golly Suzam. This is my kind of shaving cream. Very smooth shave and my wife loves it touching my chin,5
20011,The handle was too long for me to use easily.,3
20012,Bought these on advise from a friend.  They do the job but not quite sure these will be my go to blades in the future.,3
20013,The actual color turned out to be a redish brown and did not look good on my eyes.,2
20014,I bought this because of a Consumer Report review but I have to say that the shave is no where close to a razor,2
20015,"They could be a little thicker as they are a little flimsy, but they get the job done.",4
20016,Works ok and guard gives me some peace of mind.,3
20017,Did not like this at all. I went back to regular shave gels like Nivea. I use the Braun Series 7 razor.,1
20018,Purchased as a recommended sleep aid. . . . . appealing scent.  very nice overall.,4
20019,"This works great for when my wife is cutting my hair at home. However, the back of the cape could have been longer.",3
20020,"Nice idea to use natural fibers, but doesn't last long.  Used daily for three weeks and developed holes along edge of bamboo / jute fiber.",2
20021,These are great. I just wish it took a little less time to get here,4
20022,"The shave is great, however, it is a bit loud. But, I can live with  it.",4
20023,These worked well but there are better blades out there....I don't want to name names but just read some reviews,4
20024,"Nice, subtle shade that is inexpensive but looks great.",4
20025,It smells good and makes your skin really soft. I only gave 3 stats because the fragrance is not as strong as it used to be,3
20026,it works but not as good as the cheaper walgreens septi pen.,4
20027,It came on time . Doesnt work will with braces the magnet get stuck to the braces. But all in I would get again of I had too,3
20028,"It is very easy to handle. It is trimming in a sharp manner. V
We can do trimming pretty quick",4
20029,"I used this product before, from a different retailer, so knew what to expect! It was on point and good to work with!",4
20030,"hard to put on, no stretch to it, nice design, but not what I expected after seeing photo size is small",2
20031,More work than my in styler but probably easier on the hair.,3
20032,So far so good.  Maybe I should get back to you after my next dentist appointment.,4
20033,"I expected them to be a bit larger, but they are sturdy.",3
20034,Was disappointed. Broke me out.. still pretty full after years of purchase have passed,2
20035,It does a good job and not hard to use. I may have liked it better if the arm was not attached.,4
20036,Not the best for extras their good its the neck fitting barley any Velcro no snaps,3
20037,They do the job but only lasted a few days. They ripped and came a part.,3
20038,"This smells so good! It lasted us for over 6 months, too.",5
20039,I ordered a two pack and only received one. Comb seems fine. I use it mainly for my beard.,1
20040,"Did not work as promised a spoon works better.  Would not recommend, waste of money.  lashes stay curled for a few seconds only.",1
20041,"The size is too smaller than I expected, maybe I can use it for my dog.",1
20042,Soft supple feel on my feet...love this product! The price is unbeatable.,4
20043,"This product has great battery life and is fairly quiet when running.  However, it sometimes requires two or three rounds before I have a complete shave.",3
20044,Last month I ordered GiGi Mini Pro Kit. I am very happy with my purchase and with the short delivery time.,4
20045,It's fantastic however if it came in a larger size it would be even better,4
20046,"Great product, good price, arrived in good shape on time!",5
20047,It does not work as well for me as the gel.,4
20048,"I was very pleased with the service I received.  i had the item in less than a week, and it worked extremely well.",4
20049,I decided to try it and it is great---thank you  charge me for it.,4
20050,"I got 2 colours praline and another one, the praline one came broken and whenever i want to apply it keeps coming out by itself.",3
20051,It works great until the hose breaks. I'm looking for a replacement now.,4
20052,Sort of fits the brush and the the razor handle fits perfectly.,4
20053,"Not product in the picture, results different i want the purple avalon organics wrinkle Q10",1
20054,I have yet to receive  my 2 lots of rings . Please give me a date on each one when I will receive  the rest of my jewelry  .,1
20055,Didn't receive all of the pieces and there were a lot of identicals.,1
20056,Do not buy this. I got like four of the same color and one of the color was broke. Not worth money or time.,1
20057,"I spread it in our back yard & it helped a little, but no big deal. Wont buy again.",3
20058,Stings your face & i don't have sensitive skin.,1
20059,this set is a waste of money it  didn't evan last one sesson all the straps and chains broke and,1
20060,"Gave me the pink ones, oh well gets the job done",5
20061,"When I screw the ball on it does not stay, it comes off.",3
20062,Ordered the pack of 6 and only received one.  Can't seem to get the missing five without returning the one....which seems silly.,1
20063,"IT is cool, but it lasts nothing. You have to dye it like VERY often.",3
20064,"Great quality, heavy, large. Looks great on my counter.",5
20065,bought it as a gift for a friend. I love Andalou products. we'll see if she does too!,4
20066,"Was not what I expected, may be the texture of my hair",2

20068,"These work ok, but I use them to keep the back straps of my sandals on.",3
20069,I buy this stuff on a regular basis.  It does wonders for sore muscles. Try it.  You will love it.,5
20070,"didn't work for me. Maybe it works for other people, everyone's toes are different I guess.",2
20071,"Haven't received my order yet, but from previous experience its a great product",4

20075,"Thanks, fast shipping, good packaging. Product as described. Will buy a few more soon.",5
20076,The shipping time was long but the product was goo enough. Best for massaging.,4
20077,"These blades are very sharp.
They either dull or the edges fold almost immediately after one use.",3
20078,I like the smell but I haven't noticed any difference in how gay men interact with me. For the smell i would buy it.,3

20088,"Looks nothing like the picture, but I'm gonna try it and see how it works",2

20097,Not bad for money it can tip over i keep it filled and you can put a plate on bottom for weight til well worth it..,4

20134,"I really like this; good hold, washes out well. Highly recommend.",4
20135,Horrible. Leaves armpits itchy and scabby. Definitely not the same formula as in the stores. What is going on here?,1
20136,The elastic is too tight.  It hurts to wear it.  Sorry.,1
20137,"These blades are very, very sharp!  That said, if due caution is used, you will have a nice, clean shave.",4
20138,Too bulky with no battery. I much prefer the small portable one I purchased. It also has a battery.,3
20139,I really like the way this product  enhances my hair's natural curl without being sticky.  Lightweight and non-greasy.,5
20140,This tool is effective at flossing but difficult to maneuver and little direction provided. Perhaps just takes more time and trial.,3
20141,One was broke sadly and i wish i coudl of got better colors vut besides that their great!,4
20142,It came all beat up and bumped. It broke after a day of 1 use. There was a break in the tube and bent greatly,1

20149,Plastic cap was broken in small pices and there was no size shown and it was a small can,3
20150,"Grate soap,nice smell. Makes my skin very soft.",5
20151,"Good for gentle, allergic skin to clean pores. I bought this specifically to use on my nose after makeup removal.",4
20152,liquid is much more effective and i was some what dissappointed in the gel which i will purchase the next t,3
20153,"Smells amazing - and has me feeling great too, after the bath.",5
20154,You get what you pay for. These blades dull very quickly.,1
20155,"Wrong product!
I order this & got 3 iPhone chargers instead!???? I really am need a refund!",1
20156,I got these super quick! Theyre true to color in photos and even cane with tanning lotion!,5
20157,For being unscented this smells horrible.  It really doesn't eliminate the smells.,2
20158,"a couple of the scents are a bit much but, we love the oils. The oils work great and finish clean.",4
20159,Well it mosturizes good but doesn't keep the oil away and isn't really a mat lotion. Didn't care for it but it does moisturize,3
20160,If you have rather large glasses they won't fit. Ray Ban wayfarer 54mm definitely didn't fit. Seemed to be decent enough though.,3
20161,"I love my skin two weeks after using this. Former smoother skin, blemishes clearing up. I will continue to use. It goes on smoothly",5
20162,"Bijan has found a winner, yet it's my understanding their discontinuing this scent, why toss out your best product...odd !",4
20163,The  OZ Naturals  are a very Nice product line.  Glad I foind them.,4
20164,Used 2 boxes for long hair the color stayed strong for a month much better then other brans,5
20165,Quality product for a great price with timely shipping.  What more could you ask for?,5
20166,will get things out of your teeth left behind from brushing and flossing.,4
20167,I have not seen any results yet! I have started on a second bottle! I am praying that my hair will grow back!,1
20168,Not what I expected. ..it don't stick. ...,1
20169,Not clean enough after use. Still see clear roots of beards. I am not sure whether 7 series will be better.,2
20170,I think this is way too expensive for the amount you get.,1
20171,It is very thick rope like floss. It is called tape for a reason. It is suppose to be thin and flat.  Very disappointed.,1
20172,All went very well with no problems what so ever.  I would shopt this site again.  Thanks for your help and service.,4
20173,Horrible lip gloss.  It gets dry & cracks & does not last even an hour.  Would not buy again.,1
20174,This product caused a severe red rash necessitating a visit to a dermatologist and prescription ointments.  Took a week to go away after much itching.,1
20175,"I really wanted to like this product, but water squirts everywhere no matter how careful I am.  It always ends up with a mess.",1
20176,I like the variety of tips/brushes and have even put mouthwash in the water receptacle per the instructions. It gave my mouth a very fresh feeling.,4
20177,"bought wrong shade so im not sure how this actually worked, bought another shade to retry and will provide feedback again",3
20178,Works great protects my scalp when using prior to applying my wigs with tape.,4
20179,great soap for evening out skin complextion and fading spots all over the body. Ive used this for over 10 years and i will continue :),4
20180,"I thought from the ad that I was ordering replacement ""heads.""",3
20181,Smells so nice so makes me want to use it.,4
20182,Getting hard to find in the stores.  I guess they don't have a strong market any more.  I have used it for 60 yrs.,4
20183,Same thing. No difference at all. Save your money and invest in better products.,2
20184,"Soooo Bad, just 3 months, the battery is dead which can not be charged any more. So disappointed!",1
20185,you have to go over each area three times for it to give you a close shave. charge lasts several days.,3
20186,It works very well but occasionally it trips the circuit breaker.,4
20187,"They are stickers, poor quality and they  peeled off under 2 gel coats after 3 days, I do not recommend this product",1
20188,"smelled nice at first, but the tube soon dried out and the scent did too",2
20189,"As always extremely fast shipping
Price is great
I've purchased those to modify and make them work with a tarantula x6 drone
Great product",5
20190,I thought i would like the color more... it's a little darker than advertised and it makes my lips really dry,3
20191,Recharging is fast and it lasts for a long time.  Shaving is smooth and it does a good job.,4
20192,Melted somehow and never returned to a solid form. Could not use.,1
20193,"Always happy to receive these in the mail, as the timing is great for replacing the old nozzle!",5
20194,"Pins for holding brush rollers, as expected.  Preform well.  Fast shipping.  Thanks...5+ seller.",4
20195,"got this for my mom, to make arabic coffee. works great and is fast",5
20196,Great product! So much cheaper than paying to have wax services done in a salon.,5
20197,Does not hold a charge. Does a average job at best when it is fully charged. This is not what your looking for.,1
20198,"Used this for my rolling acne scars and it broke me out, even when I used the tiniest bit :(",1
20199,This may be better for some people than others. I was one of the others.,3
20200,"these did not seem to work as well for my husband as the one's we'd ordered before, they pulled at his wiskers...",3
20201,I love the colors. Just wish there was a lil bit more pack in the box one of my eye shadows was broke!,3
20202,We didn't notice that this did anything great for our skin...,3
20203,"Yikes, this stuff is cheap-o.  Smell's cheap, looks cheap, IS cheap.  Go with Gillette's stuff if you in the $5 range",1
20204,"So far so good, smooth feel on face. Though i wish it contained SPF.",5
20205,Ya know...for what you pay..it's great. Looks bettet after you wear it a few times and it becomes less stiff.,4
20206,This shaver was highly rated so I purchased it. It did not remove the wiskers from my neck. Very dissappointed,2
20207,Exactly what I expected from a good toner. My skin is very sensitive and the toner is gentle.,4
20208,This product is perfect for covering the roots between colors.  Will order again !!,5
20209,Nail polish will never get dried out again. This works great,4
20210,They did not meet my expectation of Amazon quality.  I did not see ear studs.,1
20211,Product was just what was ordered. This is the only floss that I use.,5
20212,This is a good soap. I have been using it for a year and wouldn't change it. Good price too,4
20213,Very happy with my first time using it my hair was manageable,4
20214,Oil is ok but it has too heavy and kind of cheap perfume smell,2
20215,What can I say; it fits the bill nicely.  Seems well made.  Can't beat it for the price.  Would recommend to others.,4
20216,I have the Waterpik for about 1.5 year before final stop working. The product is not reliable as the old model.,2
20217,This product sprays out too much at once and is not easy to blend into the hair once it's on.,2
20218,Good product at fair price. Just a little bulky to store. This is our second and they do help with issues.,4
20219,this cleanser is the best ever for dry skin. it smells good too.  i absolutely love it. hope they don't stop making it.,5
20220,Not sellers fault but this product did not work for me.  My adhesives lift faster when I use this and it doesn't prevent irritation at all,2
20221,"does the job, takes a minute or two to dry, but once it does, it keeps you dry.",4
20222,It feels good.  Whether it works or not remains to be seen.,3
20223,It makes the shaving act with an electric shaver much easier and smooth and it is pleasant in cosmetic terms.,4
20224,great product !!!!  fast shipping!!!!  thank you!!!,5
20225,"I love these, they fit perfectly in my purse and the color is amazing",5
20226,"This product goes with my Braun Series 7 and Wal-Mart No Longer provides this product.  So, I am forced to order online!",5
20227,This wax kit has everything you need to get the job done. You really get your money back after just a couple uses.,4
20228,"Awful,  you get what you pay for.  This is cheap and thin didn't offer any volume to my hair",1
20229,It doesn't work is Missy and the wax doesn't pull the hair,1
20230,Not to be used with crowns and fillings. Dentist said it was like pressure washing the cement of my crown and knocked it off.,2
20231,I have a great feeling when i use it and it is clean and comfortable compared to regula r one.,4
20232,The price of the product was what made me buy it.  It is the cheapest I have ever seen.  It is also a great product.,5
20233,The instructions are not clear nor do all the heads fit in the box.  It has also cut my gums in spots.,1
20234,The heads of the brushes are all loose so any pressure I have to try to shove them back on,2
20235,Great all around hygien product. Good size for traveling with travel kit.,4
20236,I loved the color of these. I gave these as a gift to my son's girlfriend and she was pleased.,3
20237,"I like this set because it's fun, easy, and fast! I love it! And it's enough for my hair as well!",4
20238,Both malfunctioned within a year. We got replacements through warranty.,3
20239,Great blade! Love that they come in little boxes.,4
20240,I have been looking to try this product and the price was so good that I bought two jars. Hopefully it will be worth it!!,4
20241,"It s ok for the price.  Although it looks more ""costumish"" for a play than a piece of jewelry.",3
20242,"Very nice, would recommend that you purchase the perfecto shaving brush.  It fits perfect, my old brush did not",5
20243,Item was well packaged. Sent by Fed Ex however and cost was exhorbitant. Wouldn't order again if sent by Fed Ex.,3
20244,"Sadly, I see no discernible difference in my blackheads after using this for a week.",1
20245,Not bad for the value but one did come in broken and had to glue it back together!,3
20246,"Very easy to use, and works well.  Worth the price.",4
20247,"I like this product, but it falls off the dryer sometimes while I'm using it.",4
20248,They are beautiful and small i just wish they were longer or my nose is to thick,4
20249,"that would be great if it could contain more water
i am worrying about that whether it will make a big gap between my teeth and gum...",4
20250,"IT DOES IT'S JOB!! I CANT LIVE WITHOUT THIS TRIMMER! =)

IT'S THE BEST ONE I HAVE EVER HAD",5
20251,Very sticky formula. Needs a moisturizer be for application. Stays on very well though,4
20252,I've used it for two weeks and see a huge difference in my face which is usually oily.,5
20253,Great moisturizer! The only thing I've found that could handle my dry skin and also faded dark spots,4
20254,I like this unit. Easy to use but would like to have a longer cord.,4
20255,"I received in a cold day, and the pomade is froze. it can't be wash off by waster.  I don't like it.",2
20256,"Great for oral hygiene, when I actually use it.  It's a good machine, but there is nothing like a good electric toothbrush.",4
20257,Didn't think I would like this device but I love it for summer especially between pedicures.,4
20258,they are really smooth but the bump in the middle is a surprise when going to a larger size whoa what a shock stings like hell,3
20259,Use this daily and I find it powerful and that it really cleans between my teeth.  Hopefully it is also doing a good job on my gums!,5
20260,"I bought this for my girlfriend but she has since dumped me. When she was my girlfriend, she seemed to enjoy it.",4
20261,Not bad. Just used it once though. I'll see if its effective over multiple uses,3
20262,"It maybe really good for the oral health as claimed, however It tastes like bad vinegar and it does not give refreshing feeling in the mouth",1
20263,"will this product work for actually make breasts grow, or will it just make you breasts appear larger?",1
20264,I don't know what I would do without this formula! I only wish they'd sell individually--flush product and pre-treatment product,3
20265,Did not do what I wanted it to for my hair - remove buildup without drying it out to an inch of its life.,1
20266,good cover make up but took the wrong color im usually that color in others but this seems to be lighter,2
20267,Didn't care for the feel and didn't help much,1
20268,Been using this product for years. Gives a close shave and works well.,4
20269,I love this product.  The dimethicone makes it non-greasy like a primer. Perfect for under your makeup.,5
20270,It is nice for price cannot beat it. It had so so rating but mine has not broken and it is a perfect fit.,4
20271,"Not quite like the picture, not a smooth stainless steel looking finish...but still awesome!",4
20272,I didn't see a very noticeable difference when I completed the whitening kit but my biggest complaint would be that the bottom strip would always slip off.,3
20273,The palette itself was smaller than I expected; should have read the description. The colors are really pretty and pigmented.,4
20274,"Product received in non-working condition. It would not turn on. Return from Amazon was a non-issue, easily handled.",2
20275,I ordered conditioner but received shampoo. I do love these products as they work well. But not if you don't get what you ordered.,1
20276,The sprayer did not fit my faucet so was unable to use it.,3
20277,Smells good. Very rosey. I use it for relaxing warm bubble baths.,4
20278,Looks like it came from the dollar store in real life. Not worth almost $20!,2
20279,"My wife liked this, no further comments except that it came a little slow. Ebay was cheaper for some of the same items",4
20280,"Received this product with the seal opened, and when I looked inside, the bottle was half filled with the detergent. It looked used.",1
20281,It smells a little odd so I'm reluctant to use it.  I went back to my other brand.,3
20282,Actually I didn't see any improvement on this.  Expensive and no attraction noted.,1
20283,I like the pigment of these eye shadows. It seems to last longer than other palettes I have bought in the store.,4
20284,"Very roomy so if you shower with electric rollers in, this is for you. Would not recommend for travels as satin stays wet too long",4
20285,"When i use this stuff, it decreases the size of my pimple and the redness",4
20286,"The merchandise is excellent. However, I am only giving a one star because it took over 30 days to receive the item.",1
20287,"Very heavy, looks good matching my razor handle. I hope the rubber base holds up over time",5
20288,for the price well worth it however i wear it as a bracelet...very fun! fits comfy on smaller wrist,4
20289,i liked these but you get none of what is in the pics,4
20290,"Runs so quietly it's a pleasure to use, very nice product. Trimmer works great, too.",4
20291,Loved these so much when they arrived. Wore the pink one right away and it broke first day/first use.,2
20292,Slower to heat up then I would like but this size is difficult to find for those of us with very short hair.,4
20293,"Sensitive on the face and no harsh strong smell. I still have acne and that sucks, but this isn't made for that.",4
20294,Worked great at first but after 4 months started losing its power,3
20295,Works but I have a feeling the strap will get stretched out real fast.,4
20296,Too rough on the skin to use and way too big.,2
20297,It makes the shaving act with an electric shaver much easier and smooth and it is pleasant in cosmetic terms.,4
20298,I didn't do much on the face. But the feeling of rubbing it on my face was good.,4
20299,I absolutely love this product and use it every single day!  I highly recommend it for anyone (especially sensitive skin!),5
20300,"I love the product itself, but Ive purchased two bottles on separate occasions and both have leaked from the top.",4
20301,"These boxes must've been left on a shelf for 5 years.  The ""gels"" were solid as a rock, and stuck to the wrap.",2
20302,"it is not easy to wear, do not feel comfortable.",3
20303,I don't know about this because the Mario Badescu seems to work alot better than this.,3
20304,"Good product but I ordered the spray instead of the gel.  Overall, going to use it anyway :)",4
20305,Works great on a lock who's key freely rotates. If you have a sticky and hard to move key these snap right off!,3
20306,Don't buy this. I felt silly getting this.  Maybe for a 6 yrs old learning to breid her dolls hair would be perfect.,1
20307,"Does the job. It does dry your nails faster, but I feel like my nail polish chipped a lot faster.",3
20308,These are so great for cleaning invisible braces!! Love this product!!!!,5
20309,Read about this in Better Homes and garden.  Like the smell and find that it helps my hair.  Would recommend it to a friend.,4
20310,Only lasts through a few uses then it won't stick anymore,2
20311,great deal however the rhinestones do fall out after a few days,3
20312,Not what I expected. Sample so small hard to use,1
20313,"Love this product.....unfortunately, I can't afford it again.",5
20314,Doesn't cut well and does not provide a close shave,1
20315,"Tiny little box with tiny little samples.
But they smell nice and lather well!",3
20316,"Sadly, someone tried it and the product doesn't work. Was still a funny bachelor party gift prank. Don't buy otherwise.",1
20317,The smell is so smooth and sweet. Perfect size. Great buy. And it arrived on time.,4
20318,"My wife uses this all the time.  I have a hard time using it but thats just me, she loves it.",4
20319,"MUCH lighter than I expected. And, it is more of a frost than matte finish.",1
20320,"Loved getting to be crafty, I bought it to make gifts but it would make a great shower craft as well!!!!",5
20321,"Ok, but not very funcional, small pieces are the best...",2
20322,This product does exactly what it's made to do and looks nice.  I now own 2.,5
20323,"We bought this for our son who recently got braces, and it works great for him.  Now everyone uses it!",4
20324,The smell somewhat soapy - not a nice fragrance like other soaps these days.  The product works well in the winter for dry skin.,3
20325,The perfect length for my monroe. It seems high quality but the ball is a little loose.,4
20326,It looks like it's all seperate and it's not at all. It's all one crappy little bracelet. When I say little I mean TINY,1
20327,These are beautiful looking but they smell like mildew or bug spray.  I am returning them.,1
20328,"I did as directions said but it only was usable for a few weeks. I loved the product itself, if it could last longer.",2
20329,This was a gift for my teenage son and it came well packaged with directions. Easy to use by anyone. Highly recommend.,5
20330,It had very low power!  Wimpy!  Sent it back.,2
20331,"I think its okay, I just don't like the smell.",3
20332,"Love love love this owl. Get so many compliments on it. It's large but that's what I wanted, perfect sweater necklace",5
20333,Get what you pay for..and the material does seem to be cheaper but its durable and they do the job!,4
20334,the most basic trimmer that you can get.  not sure what qualifies it as a bikini shaper or trimmer.  cheaply made. would never buy this again,1
20335,"It was nice for a while, but after just a few months of use, it cracked.",3
20336,"Like the feel of this on my skin, to early to see  if it is working but gives me a sence of hope.",5
20337,"Excellent quality blades, and Beauty Exchange LLC delivered promptly.",4
20338,"I like the way it feels but the fragrance is way to strong. However, it does,tend to go away after awhile.",3
20339,Really love this bowl the dark wood is really nice. The company couldve done a better job finishing the inside though,4
20340,"have never found a Great Electric shaver  Best one yet!!!  That's not saying It's Great!!!

Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah",3
20341,These brushes are super soft with a great price but I don't think they pick up makeup very well.,4
20342,"But at least my tongue is a healthy shade of pink now- and so is my nose, and my cheeks, and my ears...",2
20343,Great trimmer. I usually remove the guard as I need it to get a closer trim. Solid and does what I need it to.,4
20344,doesn't do much good to me because I want something that's soft and has a good contour. this one is cheap and too easy,1
20345,seems more like a toy and i don't think it will really handle pedicure requirements have to use a very light touch or motor stops,2
20346,This is not a makeup foundation first of all. Ageless ultra max is a supplement.,3
20347,"Made my lashes feel brittle & damaged, definitely won't be using as mascara again. But might be good for a craft project!",2
20348,Not a fan of this product at all. It sprays everywhere and leaves a white foamy residue under your arms. Roll-ons are much better!,1
20349,These don't stay on very well and are smaller than the orthopad brand that we usually buy. Wouldn't buy them again.,2
20350,Love the brush! It's hard to buy a brush unseen but I believe I made a good choice.,4
20351,I'm just in love with this case plus it comes with a lock !!!,5
20352,Still holding up! It looks nice and it's holding up with regular use so far!,4
20353,The only thing I do not care for is the T bracket to hold the sink to the wall.,4
20354,"the item is good, however, I found the discount just the second day after I ordered",4
20355,"I love it, just as it looks in the picture :)",5
20356,Would give it 5 stars but my old 3 series head gives a closer shave,4
20357,"Whis I spent the money and gotten the product I was familiar with. It worked, kind of. Next time I will skip this one.",3
20358,"Works great and cleans the hair from my clippers. But, the bristles got soft and bent after a few uses",4
20359,does not foam easily and I did not see a good enough difference to buy again,2
20360,These wonderful little lashes are perfect. Now I don't have to mess with mascara very much anymore. Thank u ardell.....,3
20361,Color and quality are good. the only thing is that it takes a bit more effort to squeeze out the lip gloss,4
20362,"I received 2 bags and a hat.  I lost a button on each bag within the first day of having the bag.

Big disappointment!",2
20363,"Love it, easy to use and covers the gray perfectly!",4
20364,Not at all like color pictured. Much more pink than rose,1
20365,"I DID NOT  receive the product I thought I was buying..... package contained Cinema Secrets brand of liquid latex, not the Mehron brand!",1
20366,"I thought this was a body mist, but it is an oil.  Does smell wonderful though!",3
20367,This has been helpful for some flaky places in skin.  It's a little bit greasy though.,4
20368,"Works very well. Good hold, yet pliable and does not irritate my skin as many other hair products have.
--Joseph S.",5
20369,A little goes a very long way. Would consider this more of a spot concealer than an all over the face product.,5
20370,"No idea what it is like since I never got it, feel like I was robbed
Really, nothing else to say to reach your required words quota",1
20371,It didn't work as well as some of the other brands I used was a disappointment,2
20372,Very cute on my nipples. Boyfriend is intrigued by them.,5
20373,I haven't opened up the second one I bought. But the first one is very good after 2 years.. This one is for our other home.,4
20374,These were ordered for the girl who cuts my hair. She usually changes the blade after one or two uses. Price is good.,5
20375,"Eh it's okay, the first layer is a bit shiny but it gets better, I also use it as a lip liner!",2
20376,no difference at all.  i have 3 spots and none have faded at all.  i guess i'll just seek other products,2
20377,I actually bought it as a gift for someone but as far as I know they love it,4
20378,Bottle I received was empty and the expiration date stamp was blurry so it could have been expired.,1
20379,It does what intended and shipped when I was told it would!,4
20380,Nice self-tanner. Gives a hint of color when you apply and tans face nicely.,4
20381,I don't really know how good these are - they are for my boyfriend,4
20382,"No good, it looks like a clam. Not worth the $2.42, I just ended up tossing it.",1
20383,It's okay.  I had to return it because the tray didn't expand long enough for my long brushes.,3
20384,This product fits great in my toiletry travel bag and in my purse so I may brush after lunch.  Stylish and sonic. Great combination,5
20385,"Great quality makeup brushes, easy to use and comes with a great case all for an exchange of a review not to mention next day delivery. Thanks",5
20386,"I loved what this did to my hair, but it just stopped working after a few months. You get what you pay for.",2
20387,"Dry and doesn't stop acne, its a total waste of money and time but other products are good, just didn't work for me",1
20388,Well built and solid.  Price is outstanding for what I have seen offered for similar products.  Love it.,5
20389,Not that good bunch up on top and bottom did not pull as tight as I hoped,1
20390,Nice new scarf. Soft thin fabric. Looks very nice on.,4
20391,"This simply does not work at all. I get results from Black Cohosh, nothing from this nonsense except a lot less money in my account.",1
20392,"I bought this as replacement for pro 1000, which was great and lasted me for 5 years. This one broke after 1 month",1
20393,"Easy to use. Does a nice job.
P.s. if your kid knocks it over onto your hard wood go get lots of baby oil!",5
20394,I really like the Gillette clear gel. It seems to do a decent job of controlling sweat and smell issues.,4
20395,"GREAT Razor at a low price!

Purchased for our son for Xmas and he loves it;very close shaves.",5
20396,"Works great if you aren't trying to trim thick hair, but it is not intended to work for thick hair, either.",4
20397,Poor quality... the elastic wasn't sewn on properly.,2
20398,Shorter in the back than I thought it would be.,3
20399,Very sharp. They shave great when used on the head.,5
20400,The floss works great. Much better than the string kind. The artificial mint flavor is more like a candy flavor than mint.,3
20401,There are more eye shadows than there should be. And the instructions have some powders in the steps that were not included in the sample kit.,3
20402,This is a very cute idea but its not silver and you can smell the metal in it so I will give it a five star for the beauty,5
20403,great product but I should have looked at the size before purchasing.,3
20404,Use it as the directions specify. Only problem is that it requires running hot water until it warms up to fill the reservoir.,4
20405,Took them as instructed and didn't notice a difference.  It seems the teeth are smoother and cleaner but not whiter.,3
20406,Didn't really give it a chance due to too much fragrance. Didn't like the scent plus very irritating to my skin.,3
20407,"i like it it feels light on my skin , and it's not that white so it's great , and it has a nice coverage",4
20408,The clasp only let's this bracelet be a certain width so it flops around on my tiny wrist. It's cute though.,3
20409,"I love it, just wish it didn't go so fast or maybe it's just how I use it lol",4
20410,Didn't really work for me. But no side effects either.,3
20411,It's a bit smaller than the regular beauty blender but it seems original,4
20412,"Definitely the cleanest cutting blade I've ever used in a safety razor, and for the price? fantastic!",5
20413,I use this to treat a fresh tattoo. It works incredibly well. No scabs and I think it heals much faster too.,5
20414,I received the brushes but I did not receive the bags.,2
20415,Ok... but... a lot of the groves are not deep enough,3
20416,Do not waste your time with this product. I did not receive real dried flowers waste of money!,1
20417,"The only shampoo that works for me since Tegrin stopped production.  Hard to find  I bought 2, a 2year+ supply.",5
20418,greasy and does not absorb well...the moisturizer comes off as soon as I start sweating so I end up with white streaks on my face :(,2
20419,"I like the way it makes my skin feel however I haven't tried it on my hair yet

Thank you",4
20420,"Works very well and considering the fact that my shaver was bought back in January 17, 1910 I am very happy with the
results it gives.",5
20421,"Nice color, great coverage of grey hair! Color a  little darker than I thought.",4
20422,"Awful, got stuck in my hair. Took my 45 min. to get it out :(",1
20423,I love  using  this  product  because  sweat  a  lot .  It  may  be  pricy  but  it  the only  deodorant  that  I  use.,5
20424,The good shave the blade has at the begining will only last for 3 or 4 shaves.,3
20425,A little dry because it's so matte but a gorgeous color and you can't beat the price.,4
20426,"Stretched out after first time wearing them. Unraveled after 3 times wearing them. I recommend to purchase more expensive, better quality ones.",1
20427,Sticky like everyone says but mess around with it enough and you can figure out how to wear it.,3
20428,Worthless. More trouble to send it back than worth of my time.,1
20429,"great smell.

does not leave residue

or weigh hair down",4
20430,Smells great but very subtle. I would recommend layering with the body lotion.  I love Kai because it doesn't smell artificial.,4
20431,Makes you extremely sticky. Does not moisturize. My legs still have scales from being dried out from the pool. Citrusy scent is unisex.,1
20432,Smells like orange at first but then smells putrid like skunk!,1
20433,Theyre great for exfoliating.  I used them Himalayan body scrub.,5
20434,These colors are very pretty and you can do a lot of nail designs with them.,4
20435,I loved my brushes the pouch is so cute. I will be buying again for $4 bucks cant beat that.,4
20436,"love it, hard to find a good match for my skin tone! but this is perfect.",5
20437,The smell was a little too light but still was nice especially as a tonic for my face!,4
20438,I like it a lot seems to help with wrinkles and as a moisturizer .  I would recommend it.  Great,4
20439,One of the compartments was broken and all of that colors gems were lost in the package when they arrived.,3
20440,the lotion was broke and spill all over inside the box when i opened my package,1
20441,I have waited patiently for this to come thru the mail. I am happy it finally came so I can actually use it.,3
20442,"Not as realistic as I would have liked, but soft and cuddly",4
20443,My daughter liked how easy to use the clips were but found the hair to be thin and hard to brush.,4
20444,"Good mouth wash. Isn't as strong as lsiterine. I like the burning sensation, but this mouth wash didn't give me that.",4
20445,Not sure if it's working. Used for a year. Will keep taking,3
20446,"While the dentist swears by this, I am not so sure that it was worth the money.  It was a good price.",3
20447,Not happy!!!! Second time I tried to use it a row of the brush came out!  Would not recommend this prouduct,1
20448,It was a bit too wide for my hair tape extensions. I recommend the second size down.,4
20449,I have been using Aqua Velva for over 30 years. This is  a knock off. Smells rotton,1
20450,Works well and smells great.  Better than other baby soaps we have tried.,4
20451,"This is a good product. It's true that it ""balls up"" less than talcum powder and the scent is nice.",4
20452,"Nice compact size; works as expected; use it to cool off my Westie, my support dog",4
20453,I ordered lip studs and received an ear cuff?? So annoying...thumbs down!!,1
20454,I prefer medium golden brown but it was not available.,3
20455,"Very pretty, but the ""combs"" that hold it on jab my head and give me a headache after an hour or two.",3
20456,I still have no idea why 6 colored pen with all black ink.,4
20457,Arrived okay. Kind of smaller that I thought it would be,4
20458,Worst blades ever had.  Nail clipper sharper than these blades.,1
20459,"Works ok. sometimes won't turn on, I unplug, clean out, refill and try again, usually it works...",3
20460,There's always gunk left on my teeth after brushing that I can easily scrape off with my nails...,2
20461,Must have for my shaver so I must buy these unfortunately,3
20462,Microfiber material is great for makeup removal. The silver infused material is great for acne prone skin since silver is antibacterial.,5
20463,This is a great stand--very easy to keep clean and it looks very nice on the counter...,5
20464,"works well, but as stated by another, it is not as powerful as the older model it is replacing",4
20465,Turns Black.......none of the urban spa products are good. Other brushes also turned Black from barely any use.,1
20466,Arrived opened  and leaking all over the box.  Tried shampoo but didn't help at all.  Still so itchy.,1
20467,They are not sharp. I ordered three and all three are dull. I would not buy them again. Now I have met the word requirement.,2
20468,This is a nice cream. Smells great and isn't greasy,4
20469,Maybe I didn't read enough but 3D was cool just not expecting the glow in the dark. Scared me a little the 1st night. Surprise,4
20470,"The pin is pretty but I wish it was bigger since i want to use it for my wedding. Unfortunately, I had to return it.",3
20471,Wow. very powerful. I really like using it and makes me want to floss more often,4
20472,Great product for my hair.  I really liked the price.  I would definitely recommend this product to my family and friends.,5
20473,great scent and gift for teen; hard to find scent after fall,5
20474,"They are not what I was expected, need to be more delicate and need more direction since you need a cream that nobody mention",2
20475,Broke within the first day. On the bright side I found the skull and make a necklace out of it. Best part of my purchase unfortunately.,2
20476,It broke for no apparent reason the very next day. Not happy,1
20477,Excellent product!  Received in good time.  Thank you!,5
20478,Good and easy to install.  Shipment arrive on time.,4
20479,I brought one these  gribs and have used it and the waight is heavy but it works great for me and easy to change tip .fast clean up,4
20480,"ni-cad batteries - so last decade.
not replacable - in LESS than 3-5 yrs this is just trash.
other than that.  a very good shaver",3
20481,I was hoping for something that would reduce the smell of the chlorine. I would not buy it again and stick with Nivea.,2
20482,Broke! I kept the ring part because it was cute lol,2
20483,Way darker than the picture. Does not work with my skin tone at all.,3
20484,I use Revlon pearl polish. Adding this is like adding water. I've ruined the whole polish left in the bottle I had.,1
20485,so far so good. does the job as is written and have clean cuts....just for the sake of words here!!!,4
20486,"Love the smell. Doesn't last long, but smells yummy until it wears off. Nice floral/grape smell. Must buy more when I run out.",4
20487,The hair trimmed somehow sticks to the device leaving a mess. Would not recommend this product.,2
20488,"Highlighted and colored hair, but this product did nothing.  Maybe it is not intended for mostly blonde hair.",1
20489,For the price this seems to be a good quality mirror with a well made adjustable stand that seems to be sturdy enough for regular use.,4
20490,"It's good for those who wish to save money, ok lather, but there are better products IF you are willing to spend more money.",3
20491,"HORRIBLE, I opened it and it had 3 different holes. Worst durag ever",1
20492,I REALLY wanted to love this stuff but it will NOT stay on my nails. It starts to peel off in less than 24 hours.,1
20493,bad quality brushes fall apart from stems.. would not buy them again or recommend them to any one else UGGHHH,2
20494,This product was purchased for an aquaintance who has used it before.  Amazon price was the best price found.,4
20495,Love this stuff!  Can only get it on Amazon.,5
20496,I've always used Norelco and this new one is the best.  Longest battery life and lightest and includes an attached trimmer.,4
20497,Sometimes the adhesive is on the top and sometimes it's on the bottom and there is no way to tell ahead of time.,4
20498,Really happy with this Eye Cream. Helps with Crows Feet and i looked more rested.  I enjoy texture and coffe smell,5
20499,Within the first day of using i started to get waves pn the sides of my head and i am white,4
20500,This necklace is very pretty and shiny. It shipped faster than expected and good quality for such a low price,4
20501,"Very small, and the purchase came damaged and i was missing pieces. Never again.",1
20502,Combs/brushes are a little too long.  Worked great until last week when the switch started acting up and then just plain quit.,3
20503,I am no stranger to Honey Dust and will buy more in the larger quantity for myself as well. Worth the money.,5
20504,Bottom cracked within a few months and begin leaking slowly.,2
20505,I wish it had been pure. Has a pleasant and mild vanilla scent.,3
20506,"don't the correct port tip size, but WILL keep for FUTURE usages.",3
20507,"sory ,m ade  in china.  only problem holding my mach3 razor",4
20508,Use it often.  Serves the purpose for quick trims.,4
20509,Bad fix and don't make the texture effect. Useless.,1
20510,"I don't feel it works as a conditioned, but as shampoo and body wash, its good for my son.  The apple scent is fine...",4
20511,Not as advertised. Bristles are NOT soft. Also the head is on the large side. Does not measure up to the usual OralB quality.,1
20512,Super cute...20 days to get here....Earlier then expected though. I like how you can turn the bow into bunny ears!!!,4
20513,"i like it, but they don't last very long",4
20514,"did not like this product, eye shadow won't stay on the brush... bad quality, i guess its for littke girls",1
20515,I like them so much. They really work for me. Castomer forever!,4
20516,First week I had this brush it fell apart in my hands!  Wouldn't buy another one,1
20517,"Ordered two, one of them didn't have the cap tightly closed so half of the liquid was leaked out. Bought it from OxKom.",1
20518,Love this product my skin is feeling softer after just one week I would highly recommend the Argan Oil,5
20519,Have been using this for awhile now.  Works as directed.  Arrived quickly.,4
20520,"Provides amazing benefits - no false advertising here..  Makes me feel much better,",5
20521,Does not work. was does not harden and if you use the strips the was still sticks to your face.,1
20522,Good it keep your body hair low but not shave.  But for an individual that want to keep it low without inrritation is good.,4
20523,Not big enough for the amount of hair I have :(,3
20524,Super Super thin. Lasted a few days. Not a good product at all.,1
20525,I was glad I found these curlers since i could not find this size in local stores. The are the right size for my hair.,4
20526,"I love this product,as I have used it for many years, but the cost from amazon is too high.",3
20527,Not like it use to be. This stuff started breaking me out.,2
20528,Good product. The downside is that it got here 2 days late. The ponytail holders seem to lose their elasticity quickly.,3
20529,"This seems to clean my gums quite well.  When I add a little white vinegar, it cleans the tarter off even better.",4
20530,"Very nice soap. Easily washes away, good for skin.",5
20531,Too thick to dispense easily and doesn't rub in well. No visible results.,1
20532,"great quality but very delicate, broke easily but is easy to fix with a little hot glue.",4
20533,I loved it when it arrived... It broke within 24 hours,2
20534,Somehow it cracks and you end up without lipstick in some lips areas.,3
20535,I have really DRY hands and have used ALL different type of lotion! This seems the best where it heals and gives moisture to my hands!,4
20536,Cute color but it came detached from the tube and when you roll up to apply it falls right back down.,1
20537,"DOES NOT RELIEVE MUCH OF MY PAIN,BUT DID NOT EXPECTIT,BECAUSE IT IS TO SEVERE",3
20538,you should post size for better description size is to small,3
20539,Product was delivered on time - I used this for 1 month and did not notice much of a difference,2
20540,Haven't really a big enough major improvement over the natural healing process to justify the purchase.,2
20541,"Product was hard to push through the tube, hard to apply, appeared old as it crumbled along the sides.  Would not recommend.",1
20542,It has been remarkable experience since I had Braun Series 5-590cc. Shaving with Braun Series 5-590cc is the motivation that I get up in the morning.,5
20543,I smell like orange juice and it is a little sticky just like you put orange juice on your face,4
20544,Effective but tends to break. A great deal for the price.,4
20545,"Sharp, Shaves me good, could get more uses out of it, but my facial hair is very thick and coarse! Overall very pleased!",4
20546,"stiff too hard to bend around wrist, will try again because they are so cheap. not like it cost a fortune!",3
20547,Cliradex does a wonderful job of cleaning the eyelids. Helped alleviate itchiness around my eyes,1
20548,Curler doesn't curl that well and mascara is clumpy - don't recommend,1
20549,I have had this shaver for a month and it is still holding the charge.  Gives an excellent very close shave.,5
20550,It does not get hot enough to make a difference with my hair.,2
20551,My back tooth is sensitive.  Can't get stip to stay on my back tooth.,2
20552,Dr recommended and I am going to be sure to use this shampoo once a week for my itchy scalp because it smells attractive.,5
20553,Yes I like it and it what I was looking for and needed for my thick toe nails and callouses,4
20554,"I thought I was buying the jar but all I got was the cover, expensive at $14.95",1
20555,What a wasted of money! Simply did not work for us. Didn't protect scalp at all.,1
20556,"I. Noticed a little of hair growth, and it lathers up good. I would recommended this product. Its at a good price, too.",5
20557,"It hard to spend $4+ dollars on soap, but my bf needed it for his back-acne and it did work wonders!",4
20558,"Very nice natural scent, but it is strong. Soap is also a bit drying for winter. but still nice to use with a after shower lotion",4
20559,This is a great product and I highly recommend it for others to use.  Give it a try and you'll like it too!,5
20560,"I reallly should get a new one, thus I would return the broken one. Pls help me. Pls make this right.",2
20561,the only thing this did for me is cause acne.,1
20562,love it. will continue to use all products from herline,5
20563,"Smells great and does an excellent job of moisturizing! The price can't be beat here, a salon charged my three times as much.",5
20564,Great blades for a great price.  I'm a fan of it's level of flex and thickness.,5
20565,I have very close places in-between my teeth. This is the only thing that works for me and my bridge.,5
20566,"I cannot swallow the huge vitamin C tablets so turned to this liquid form. Not only is it easy to ingest, it's tasty too.",5
20567,I used this product after shaving several times. It doesn't work very well.,2
20568,"Cleans and smells really good. Good value for this soap. Had it in my subscription so got an even better price for it,",5
20569,I wish the end was a little more curved so it wasn't so easy for the roll to slide off during use. Otherwise very functional.,4
20570,I love super hit cones but these are not or this sellers batch is spoiled or something,1
20571,"Have used it in the past and enjoy the close shave it provides, and the pleasant smell.",5
20572,I think this works really well.  I have had no irritation so it must be working,4
20573,The servo works great. I use it with my Adafruit motor shield and Arduino UNO. It is used to swivel a ping sensor for a robot.,5
20574,"Nice Brush, just loosing a few to many hairs.",3
20575,"So far is good , still is not time to write a review
I will do it later when I finish the facial cream",4
20576,We are using this for my kids haircut. It works well.,4
20577,Having to cut mesh away from flowers and triming ribbons... Just wanted it baby shower ready,4
20578,Purchased this as recommended by my dental hygentist.  Had it a couple of months and so far the only complaint I have is it's very noisy.,4
20579,"Too peperminty of a scent for me. Doesn't smell ""pretty""",3
20580,Very sticky but maybe if I use it in a different way it will work!,3
20581,One of the brushes came off but other than that I like it,3
20582,About half of these are too big to use as nail art. Definitely not as full as the picture shows.,3
20583,Its not worth it. It makes penis numb with no sensation. Its better to have without applying anything. Not recommend.,1
20584,"Order a few sizes up, because these were really small.  Gave them to my daughter.  They would be very comfortable if they fit!",2
20585,"This shampoo does what every other shampoo does,except harm you.",4
20586,Works great for tattoo aftercare and many other skin needs. Highly recommended.,5
20587,Very good product. Fits the electric shaver well and works well. Would buy these again when it is time to replace.,4
20588,The bar of soap was packaged very well. The soap didn't have a very strong fragrance. Disappointed.,3
20589,Did not work for me.  Left lots of hair and bumps.,2
20590,Feels so good on my scalp and the green apple scent smells nice. Really helps with dandruff! I'm ordering this again!,5
20591,works great to protect the little guy. easy to wash and maintain small and easy to take along with you,4
20592,Have been unable to even use this as it did not come with a US/Canada plug. It will not fit a US outlet.,1
20593,Purchased two and like the product. My skin is very dry and always looking for good moisturizers to use day and night.,4
20594,Keeps the alcohol at my fingertips and does not evaporate. Wish it did not say alcohol on it. Might use it for other liquids,4
20595,Nicely scented.  Does what it's supposed to do.,4
20596,This is a nice waxer. I gave it 3 stars because it arrived with a broken top.,3
20597,Am pleased with the results of the waterpick. Does a great job and massages my gums. It was a worthwhile purchase!,4
20598,Having just recently gotten new uppers I needed a PRESSURE WASHER  or my teeth it works well.,4
20599,Very well made stand. However it doesn't hold the Parker brushes they recommend to get with it.,3
20600,Product is alright. Made a little cheap but I got a good couple of months use of them. Great for practicing makeup in the meantime.,3
20601,Didn't like the color at all.  looked like a Kool-aid stain on my lips,1
20602,"I am using this product years ago
I never think that i can find it online
That's make me happy",5
20603,This is very good to clean in difficult areas.  It works well (and keeps on working!).,4
20604,Not too pigmented. Have to apply a few coats and reaply within a few hours. Nice shade though and cheap price,3
20605,This stuff breaks and is worthless.  Get Colgate for the best.,1
20606,"For the price, these mints are a total rip off. They do nothing for me.",1
20607,The best shampoo my family have ever tried. Suits everyones needs. Cleans and has healing properties.,5
20608,These put unnatural pressure on the eye balls.  These goggles are uncomfortable and I am concerned about the potential for eye damage.,1
20609,Did not reach to this day I do not know where my money went not up to something I do not know whether this kind of monument ......,1
20610,I like the product but the bottle was not brand new as listed.,3
20611,Came without a screw on the end to keep the brush on the wand  - un useable .. too bad - nice piece of equipment otherwise.,2
20612,"its plastic and black, should last awhile as long as you treat it nice. very thin, china made. Good price but could be better.",4
20613,This item is white and gloppy and shows on your eye line. I would not recommend this product.,1
20614,This is not anything great.  Not nearly worth what is goes for.  Did nothing for my dry skin.  Shea butter much better and cheaper.,3
20615,These are a great massage oil and the price is right but I didn't love all of the smells.,4
20616,Replacement parts went together easy just like original. Wore hole in foil upon first cleaning. Product was complete disappointment.,1
20617,"sometimes it is difficult in registering right away. have to move from finger to finger, but it does the job",4
20618,i love my rollers for my micro pedi..They work great & with sandal season starting up I got them just in time!!,5
20619,Son really likes his new tooth brush and looks to be working as he teeth are already whiter.,4
20620,You cannot beat this stuff for the price and effectiveness of the product.,5
20621,Eventho Idk how to put make up I ordered this and I love the brushes its soft..thanks and also came in early than the estimated date posted.,4
20622,Didn't even take it out of the package....and it was already broke!,1
20623,I love this shade of makeup. I just can't find it in a store where I live.,5
20624,I was not given the magnetic stud that was pictured. I was given a silver ball with no gem.,1
20625,"Best stuff, smells great, tames frizz and leaves shiny!",5
20626,Do NOT get in eyes.  You'll think  you have cataracts.  Don't really feels it enhances shine.  May work for you.,3
20627,"Not much sharp as expected,but its cost very less",3
20628,great razor that gives a close shave and makes my skin feel smooth very happy with it.wife loves to touch my face after,5
20629,"It only has a slight hold for 4C edges, especially if you sweat a lot around your head.",3
20630,Not dense at all flimsy and not worth the money. Passssssss thank you very much. Save your dollars up and buy something worth it.,1
20631,"Totally awesome, it dries my hair and style at the same time.",5
20632,"Nice looking bowl, outside was sanded smooth and varnished. The inside looks unfinished (not sanded) but varnished over the rough wood.",3
20633,"I would strongly consider this product. My dentist recommended it and it works great, just takes some getting use to it..",4
20634,It made my rash under the girls get even worse - left foul smell and peeling. Not getting it ever again...,1
20635,Works as it claims but takes time .I started seeing results after a month of use.,4
20636,It haven't  worked out for  me  still have the dark spot.,2
20637,"Has zinc oxide in it, which is used on all kind of skin conditions.  This is a helpful powder.",4
20638,This product is okay. Haven't yet experience the whole Retinol wrinkle and fine lines minimizer experience yet.,3

20640,FIRST TIME OWNER OF WATERPIC AND VERY PLEASED WITH THIS PRODUCT.  VERY EASY TO USE AND VERY EFFECTIVE CLEANING TOOL WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.,5
20641,very poor quality durag very horrible poorly sown and less then 2 weeks it has a hole it in avoid this man frfr,1
20642,I have loved this scent since childhood.  I use this product daily to freshen sheets.  Works very well for me.,4
20643,"Nice design, nice tools provided but is now leaking water like a sieve.",3
20644,"Love the scent, very nice, but ... Left hair dry course, and odd feeling.  Returned for refund",1
20645,"Best purchase I've made in eons, love it!!!",5
20646,"great for scars, apply to area twice a day and it sill fade",4
20647,Sharp and very smooth. Works well in all of my razors. Definitely on my short list of buy again blades.,5
20648,The package came and the cream box was damaged and ripped and cream was half gone and all over! Also was not sealed!,1
20649,it is shimmery and for me i have acne so i feel it makes the acne show more for a high brand i thought it would be nicer,3
20650,The stones were missing from more than two of them and there wasn't but like 3 different colors :-(,1
20651,"Smell and presentation lovely; however, after use of body lotion, I had an allergic reaction and had to wash off completely.",2
20652,i was told to buy this for tattoo healing and within days it gave me acne on my arm. too greasy for me,2
20653,"Its like my old one It works just fine, I am use to the performance.",4
20654,I have got very frizzy hair. But this product works great for frizzy and dry hair. It actually smoothens them leaving them soft and silky.,4
20655,great product but I was surprised the bottle was so small especially considering the price,4
20656,"hold really well in fine hair , and not an over the top display . simply sweet like my little one",5
20657,"Call me silly, and maybe the deminsions were posted but these were a lot smaller than I expected. They are difficult to put on.",3
20658,Just a few drops on the beard produce a very smoth electric razor shave. It's a must have for electric razor users.,5
20659,"It was a waste of money, almost no air blowing from this unit and the brush is not spinning.",2
20660,Super happy with this tape.. and I loved the little picture business card and sweedish fish too. Super cute,5
20661,Didn't really make a difference in my hair. And was too expensive for the price I bought it for.,3
20662,"I didn't buy it I'm just here to say that this is a conditioner, I was confused at 1st",3
20663,Very happy with the razors! Glad I got the 100 ct!,5
20664,I have taken this fir about 11/2 week and a notice a lenght increase ..I was surprised. It was not huge increase but noticible.,4
20665,Does not shave as close as expected. Noisy. Trimmer not as good as those on other shavers. Would not recommend.,1
20666,"Stylish and affordable product, does the job. Merkur Futur and Edwin Jagger brush fit perfectly.",5
20667,This works. It doesn't even change any eating habits like other products.,5
20668,It's a sturdy comb that does its job. Not much else to say.,5
20669,"Works pretty well, but is a little noisy. Seems like an evolved, well thought out product. And it's more fun than flossing.",4
20670,"The best, thick moisturizer to lock in the hydration. Has many uses!",5
20671,"It works well for the price but if you but invest in a man's shaver, it will be more powerful blades sharper.",4
20672,My favorite color--very natural. long lasting. The only blush compact I've ever used that hasn't ended up cracking sometime during use.,4
20673,The solid cocoa butter does a good job of relieving dry skin and doesn't have the overpowering cocoa butter smell.,4
20674,The dish was excellent and as represented in the description and as pictured was accurate.  I can recommend this small dish highly.,5
20675,It stopped working after four days. Used it for fifteen minutes twice a day.,1
20676,Does not stay on your head too well. And it's quite heavy.,3

20679,"This was so tiny, I feel like I was deceived",3
20680,"Half of these broke upon first use. They look nice for a matter of seconds, then fall apart immediately.",1
20681,It's more of a purple color and I'm not a fan. It feels okay but I wouldn't buy it again,2
20682,Was a gift. Granddaughter loves patchouli so loved it!!! The soap smell wonderful and the scent filled the room!!,5
20683,Works ok but a lot noisier than my last one which was the same model,2
20684,This is not a product made by the Body Shop - this product was made in China.  I knew immediately it was FAKE!,1
20685,As soon as I took it out the bag 4 out of 10 brushes broke,1
20686,"Good price. Recommended for all my friends.
This site is easy to used. I like it. Thank you so much.",5

20692,It is awesome - it's made doing nails so much easier ,5
20693,Needs to be plugged in all the time after a few weeks. Def closet shave though. Worth the 50 bucks.,3
20694,I should have bought this years ago! Very functional and well designed.,5
20695,Might just be a bit too much hold for my fine curls.,4
20696,I have mature complexion and I feel neutral about this cream. Don't think I would buy it again.,4
20697,"Thank You, I only wish it was more affordable.",5
20698,"After using for a month, I still have blackheads.  Also, the peppermint scent is too strong, makes my eyes water.",2
20699,This is a great wash that both my teens are using.  I like the fact that it foams and i works well with their clarisonic.,4
20700,"I only ordered these for the red one & it wasn't the same rich red, it was a brighter orange red. Dissatisfied.",2
20701,tarnishes real easy.  I threw these away.  but okay for the price you can give them away as prank gifts.,2

20711,"I am 65, so I have to give it some time, but my skin feels softer after only a couple of weeks of use.",4
20712,The light shines right in eyes causing difficulty getting a good view of bottom of feet.,1
20713,Very functional.  We found this to be the best type of flossing material.  Prompt delivery.  We previously ordered this and would order it again.,5
20714,I just gave a 3 because I have no way of knowing if it's doing anything yet. I'm just hoping it will!,3
20715,"Have used this item daily, and it is very refreshing.  Love the feel on the face.",5

20719,"This iconic oral health tool does precisely what it supposed to do, comfortably and thoroughly.  You cannot improve on the original.",5

20722,this product seems to work well and no harsh chemicals for parents of a young boy to be concerned about.,4
20723,Nice product but it is hard to get the last bit out of the bottle.,4
20724,The lotion version is better because the scent is irresistible but doesn't last long and is faint after using body wash.,4
20725,"Handy, easy to use, fits nicely in bathroom space, a bit noisy. Different heads are effective for intended use. OK",4
20726,they were smaller gauged then expected most  have stones were missing out of them.,1

20728,My 93 year old father  loves this product. . . makes him look not a day over 80! lol!,5
20729,"It is pretty, but the wheel catches alot, it is loose, and it isn't as sharp as I had hoped.",3
20730,"Was surprised they came in a cream color instead of green like the picture, but they still get the job done",4

20737,They're not the best quality but for my 9 year old they're just fine.,2
20738,"They came really nice, but when I put it on the first time it broke, but I easily fixed it",3

20741,Did not help acne at all. I should send it back.,1
20742,I bought this for my son who was having gum problems.  He said the pik used fine and it seems to be helping his redness.,4
20743,Leaves my skin soft and wonderfully scented. Smooths and moisturizers well. Absorbs and does not leave my skin feeling sticky.,5
20744,"Nice packaging, and for over foundation, it could work well. I was looking for a full coverage powder and this is NOT it.",2

20760,I'm using this product along with Soda Bottle Preforms and Caps (30/pk) for long term freezer storage of Brewers yeast.,5
20761,Smaller than it appear on the picture. Does provide extra organized storage for the bag. Material is not as good as the other one I ordered.,4
20762,"smells delicious, cleans well, rinses off easily too. Moisturizing...I can even use this to shave. Great as a bubble bath, too!",5
20763,Junk unworthy of the Mitchum name.  I am returning my purchase.,1
20764,Ordered 50' of tubing but we only got 30',1
20765,Good product but I hardly seen any difference when using it. Over time (within 1 week) the product does not stick that well.,3
20766,Didn't care for this variant of Lustray spice. YMMV but I recommend going for their regular spice scent (orange).,2
20767,terrible secondary market with prices through the roof! better to throw away the skin rejuvenator and go to the spa for the money.,1
20768,"I swear by this :) I know it makes my skin tighter and targets fat burning in stubborn areas, like the lower back!",5
20769,"Expected the trimmer to have much power than what got. That said,  does the job,  and is very safe to use",3
20770,It really helped me do my daughter's hair for ballet.,4
20771,"Makes changing toilet paper roll so easy even my husband can do it. And, there are always spares available.",5
20772,The hook on the back doesn't stay closed. Otherwise performed as expected.,3
20773,They're sharp and cheap enough to replace every other day. Not as sharp as Feathers but are still good quality.,4
20774,I love the smell of this product. it is very gentle and I use it everyday. I will buy it again.,4
20775,Perfect snug little rings. Once you figure out how to put them in. They're fabulous.,4

20777,"As described.  Prompt shipping  GOOD SELLER !!
Not as good as the origional with the round holes.
BUT aparently the mfg has changed the design.",4
20778,Wife said it's ok but not  what she was hoping for as far as end results,3
20779,Broke on the 2nd use.  My employee didn't tell me or it would have been returned...arrggh,1
20780,This was probably one of the strangest things Ive done but it works very well and the label provides clear instructions!,5
20781,"works great, gives protection throughout the day... Smells clean, you feel clean...  Dont get it in your eyes.  what else can one say?",4
20782,it's very drying and that's what I want to dry out my oily skin. I like it a lot.,4
20783,I like Neutrogena products but this one arrived unsealed. I do not use products on my face that are not sealed.,1
20784,This is very nice stuff...just a dab will do.  I put it on at night and in the morning my skin looks smooth and moisturized.,5
20785,Nail Art Gems were just as described. The case holds colors separate as they should be. I Would order from again! Thanks!,5
20786,Takes a little practice but works great. Excellant product especially if you have implants!,5
20787,These are a little small and uncomfortable.  These would probably be fine if you are a small person.  I prefer the podz eyebprotection.,3
20788,Bought it as a gift item and I have received glowing feedback.,5
20789,"This product is great for braces
The only problem with this product is that the button to release pik is very sensitive",4

20791,"These are so awesome. I got them weeks before the said arrival date, which was a huge plus. Very satisfied.",5
20792,Terrible service. Ordered these by accident and they will not give me my money back. The product may be cheap but that is not the point.,1
20793,Ok product the blades were not sharp. It burns after the shave and caused bleeding.,2
20794,"I will buy anotherone again, a very good product.",5
20795,Great product for people who do not have the time to floss.,4
20796,My old 9.99 electric shaver worked as good. Is it says 90.00 MSRP it bull.,2

20798,well made tool. good buy for your money. recommend,5
20799,Excellent product. I wish I had started using it sooner. Everything it a was advertised to be. Easy to use.,5
20800,"little thicker than dog tags and a good deal heavier, they look cool though",3
20801,The ends are to big. And hurts when trying to put in your nose especially if you have just got your nose piercing recently.,1
20802,Pricing was confusing and sizes were also off as to price,3
20803,Been using on my son since birth and he's a year now.  Love the smell and it's gentle on him.  Would absolutely recommend.,5
20804,Just didn't work for me. I went back to a Clubman styptic pencil that works better for me. Different guys like different stuff.,2
20805,This brings back some memories as it has been around for years.  Has always worked well.,4
20806,Must have! I have been using for 6 mos! Great quality!,5
20807,I would never buy these again.  They taste like nothing and just cheap overall.,1
20808,These are better than other blades that I've used.,5
20809,The hair would be okay if it didn't shed so much. The density is not 130 more like 100 which is bad because it sheds horribly,2
20810,What is gonna happen to the eyelashes if you stop using it?,1
20811,"Only OK, there are better products for this.  Mostly just vaseline.",3
20812,They do the job very well.  I like the new style of handle and the blades seem to last. I will buy more.,4
20813,"My fav floss, but could be a bit more tear free.",4
20814,"Didn't work too well for me. Maybe it would with more practice, but the quality didn't feel that good.",2
20815,This is the best selling soap out there!!! Love this product.,5
20816,The powder is a bit messy but both of these work great.,4
20817,"product itself is great, but purchasing on amazon is much more expensive than purchasing in a store.",2
20818,If you have braces this will not substitute in any way for flossing,3
20819,Does not get hot enough to work well. Hair gets tangled.,1
20820,A little goes a long way. Gets sponges and brushes clean,4
20821,"better than the ones I had before, held up well",4
20822,A little watery - I had to shake it b4 use but it works I recanend buying two bc it goes by fast,4
20823,"It has a sweet smell of grapes, but it doesnt do anything to attract women. It smells like grapes that is it.",2
20824,"skin lotion, very good but should give a try to the sunscreen one!",4
20825,"it is too big need a 1/2 inch instead, use to get that size, now cannot find one",2
20826,I didn't like this product. My chest looked flat and they were uncomfortable to wear.,1
20827,I think there are several similar products on the market. I'll only get this when it's on sale because it's double from others.,2
20828,Works as advertised and has a nice grip and way to store for travel.,5
20829,"Some of the stones are crooked, but overall not a bad purchase.",4
20830,3 of them fell apart a few days after I got them but just a little super glue and you're good. But they do work great,2
20831,"Really like. Recently realized it does snag a little, but it is better than my safety pin method",4
20832,I like the headbands but they came in 2 packages (3 headbands in each) and one entire package was moldy.,2
20833,"combs last a LONG time, will purchase again IF needed, excellent product",5
20834,They are good brushes to have around as extras or to use a couple times and throw out. Not the highest of quality but not horrid.,3
20835,Not what I expected. Looks like it sticks in your pores and comes out cakey,3
20836,Too hot in the south for this delivery.  They were melted.,1
20837,"I used this many time very good but it works by 2 base battary AAA
no carge no wire with electric !!!",3
20838,"No mention in advert that this only works in US. When I plugged it in and started it, that ruined it.",1
20839,"Water floss works great, toothbrush tip not so good.",3
20840,"I love this powder in and out of the bedroom, it's a nice daily scent and it glides on the skin.",4
20841,I can't really say that it helps razor nicks at all or maybe I don't know what I am doing.,3
20842,"Quality is a letter better then expected, for the price, these are a great value & worth a shot.",5
20843,This is the best root concealer I have ever used!  Helps extend my color!,5
20844,"It is a good product, but affective an I thought is could be . I would not  suggest it product to other consumers at this time.",3
20845,"It does the job, but is awkward to hold in the shower/tub.",3
20846,"No tangling as others reported, but still takes a long time to dry.",3
20847,"These brushes are rough, the bristles fall out and they smell horrible!! Don't waste your money!
These are nothing but junk!",1
20848,The brush side was too small for my brush. But I bent it just a little and it fits fine now.,2
20849,Very soft.  I guess I was expecting something more abrasive but I like it.,4
20850,I like the lotion.  However one of them was leaking as they arrived.,3
20851,This product did not work at all.  Do not waste your money.  I deserve a refund.  :(,1
20852,"it's very good, i just hope if it can work with an adapter also, as some times there is no enough time to recharge",4
20853,Old barbershop in a bottle! Hubby loves them all.,5
20854,Some of the balls were already stripped and I was really dissappointed.,1
20855,So far I love these! Been using for about 2 weeks now. No complaints! They work well!,5
20856,Very good value for price. Very upset that I had paid for 3 packs and only received 2.,3
20857,Works really well.  Nice to have 5 in one.,4
20858,This razor worked fine but only lasted 35 months before the switch stopped working.,2
20859,"For the price, I love these blades. I won't have to buy another pack this year, or possibly next year.",4
20860,I like the color but it was sticky. Matte isn't suppose to be glue smh im keeping but it will be used never,2
20861,Don't really feel like this helped whiten my teeth at all.,2
20862,Not happy with this product. Was expecting something more sturdy and well built but this is more like something sold at five below ,2
20863,"The brushes are the worst. They do not come clean and the bristles move, not sure it's suppose to do that.",1
20864,Fast Delivery.  The product is sturdy and solid.  I love it!,5
20865,this is a great skin care products for all skin types that I would recommend one of the best out there . Nonetheless very pleased,4
20866,"Pretty good shaver to bring on trips. Doesn't catch longer hairs; you can work at them with the trimmer, though.",4
20867,Did not get Puritan swabs. The vendor sent some other brand of swab and the shafts break very easily. Worthless really.,1
20868,"I liked the soap, but not it's form. The 'slices' are too thin and quickly break-up when you use them. Kind of messy.",4
20869,Used it once and then it didn't work anymore. Would have sent it back but I had already thrown away the packaging! Not recommended.,1
20870,"I love this product more than the very expensive ones I have purchase.
Not drying to the lips!",5
20871,It is too heavy and would like to return it.,1
20872,I didn't care for this waxing kit. It isn't water soluble and is difficult to work with.,2
20873,Are you kidding me?  I order BMC MIX DESIGN DIY 3D nail mold. Look what I got today. SILICONE BAKING MATS.,1
20874,The shaving conditioner feels great and really makes the shave much more confortable. The unique feeding mechanism is great. 5 stars,5
20875,"hmmm, not sure about it yet. Will have to give it more time",4
20876,This lipstick was just ok.  It was a bit darker than I prefer and I didn't really care for the feeling on my lips..kind of waxy.,3
20877,"It's a decent comb, it is durable and is just the right size.  However, its just a comb.",3
20878,"This item had to be returned, it was not the one he wanted and his brush did not fit.

Thank you",3
20879,"Looks a little cheap, get what you pay for.",3
20880,Not sure if this product has helped me or not..has the same density as vaseline....,3

Would not buy again",1
20883,Now I know why this has come a cult favorite. It's gorgeous!!!,5

20890,The water flosser does what it says it will do..  Like it very much.  Cleans between teeth very nicely.  like.,4
20891,Smells like Aqua Velva.  I wish they would produce the old Aqua Velva Sandalwood scent.,4
20892,Horrible bonding-- hair weft worked themselves out after 5 days.,1
20893,this mustard's write up is much better than the actual thing.  Maybe my pain level is unreachable with just a rub.,3
20894,I bought it to try it out ...I am giving it some time to work out...so far its a good product,5
20895,"Wax container was damaged, wax had leaked.  Probably should have returned the whole kit.",3
20896,"In less than a month, it was covered with black mildew. I don't understand how that even happens?!?!!",1
20897,Great product. Can extend my hair coloring by 2 weeks,5
20898,Hard to blow up hurt my ears after a while so I just didn't worry about it when I was going to use it,4
20899,"good price, considering what i'd pay for them in a pharmacy. they match any Venus razor handle, too. will buy again.",4
20900,This tea tree oil is representative of tea tree oils in general. Typical smell. Jason products are well-known for quality.,4
20901,"Doesn't stay on, perhaps I'm just doing it wrong or don't have enough thick hair to cover it all...waste of money for me",1
20902,It's quieter than most because it's fan speed is also lower than most. I returned.,2
20903,Cute brushes. Came on time. Just a little upset they break so easily. My blush brush broke in half when using it.,3
20904,Absolutely awful.  It took forever to get to me and when it arrived the product was completely dried out and totally unusable,1
20905,"Very good water flossier, i used it every day.",4
20906,"got for my daughters for Christmas, looks like really good makeup. Smaller than expected. :(",4
20907,Great as a gentle cleanser but not deep cleaning . If your face gets dirty I suggest the stone crop face wash instead. Good Luck :-),3
20908,Makes noise. No suction. Sticking your finger in your ear more productive.,1
20909,Smells like Aqua Velva.  I wish they would produce the old Aqua Velva Sandalwood scent.,4
20910,great straight blade will buy again when i need more! can be deadly and can cut you easily.  personna is good!,4
20911,these guys are sharp. I would recommend getting a sample pack before buying a whole lost of the same.,3
20912,Love it. I have been using this same style brush for many years.,5
20913,What has impressed me most so far is that this shaver has a very long charge time and sharp blades.  I would buy this again.,4
20914,"The blades are a little too sharp and cause too many cuts while shaving, not so smooth as a Feathers, Bic or Mercur",3
20915,Rusts. The only razor blade I've used that rusts with my safety razor. A lot of nicks. Will not buy again.,1
20916,Gave it to my family overseas and they love it.,5
20917,"The product is horrible, it won't stay in place, keeps falling into the tub. it has to be COMPLETLY empty to stay in place.",1
20918,"Works good, would be better if it could  get wet",4
20919,The shaver lasted a little over 3 years. I bought it because it had dual voltage for use overseas. Decent,3
20920,It was sent quickly and holds my husband's hair very well.,5
20921,"I don't know how well it attracts gay men to me, but I'm attracted to the scent: Love the fragrance!",4
20922,This is a beautiful product.  The rose scent is light and refreshing.  I can't imagine being without it in my skin care routine!,5
20923,This is a good mid size travel dryer.  I have seen smaller ones but they are usually underpowered.,4
20924,"Cant remove because of sling thickness, better off buying a wooden dowel than wasting money on this,  use your judgement",1
20925,"I didn't receive the one in the picture, instead I received a regular plastic apron and it can't hold hair at all.",1
20926,"This is an o.k. body wash. Nothing great though, not worth the price.",3
20927,2 sponge pads wore out quickly.  No way to replace them.,2
20928,no complaints. Bought a box years ago. haven't had to buy razors since.,5
20929,"I like the headband it's cute, but it fits to tight, it gives me a headache ,but it is very
stylish.",3
20930,"Is exactly what I expected for the price. Good color, and lasting very well  when traveling and at home use.",4
20931,"Women of color with thick course hair, please do not invest in this brush, it's just not for US...DO NOT BUY THIS BRUSH...",1
20932,Very cheaply made. Not at all worth what I paid. Was not impressed at all.,2
20933,Best brushes ever used. So many to choose from that there is no way there isn't one you need in the collection,5
20934,This did not work for my needs. The holders are not very deep so my curling irons and blow dryer would not stay in the holders.,3
20935,Perfect fit didn't stick to go but nice just to wear  for ur speacil mate I had a great time wearing them for my love,4
20936,This was recommended by a relative for hair growth; still using to see if it will do the job.,4
20937,"Looks good, works as intended, just had it for a short while so not sure how it will hold up.",4
20938,Great soap to use prior to putting contacts in.  Doesn't leave residue on hands or an irritating perfume smell.  On my 2nd bottle.,5

20940,Woke up with a killer headache and noticed ni improvement in my waves smh.,2

20942,not real powerful but does great if you let your hair almost dry before styling.,4
20943,"Creamy, but light lipstick in an inexpensive, but handy form.",4
20944,Love the product. Not a fan of dispensing foam thing,3
20945,"Very intense almond smell.
Might want to reconsider if you're looking for a base, any essential oils generally get drowned out by the almond.",3
20946,My first try with builder gel & this has been easy to use & inexpensive.,4
20947,"The protection powder seemed like it didn't do anything, I still had bumps and irration. Won't be buying this product again.",2
20948,Product works great in my baby's hair and on her body.,5
20949,"The fell apart first day, tried to use them but fell apart ",1
20950,"It works - it does what I need.  It's a little flimsy compared to what i expected, but sufficient.",4
20951,Not my favorite product. Dried up quick and hard to work with. Like the pencil lime product better,3
20952,I bought this product for my girl friend. So far she has had positive results and is very happy with the product!,5
20953,Cheap blades that work well enough though not as good as Feather blades for me.,3
20954,It is constructed very well and it is very comfortable.,4
20955,Fits Perfectly.  I have the Sonicare for Kids HX6311 toothbrush and these heads fit perfectly.  My kids now each have their own colors.,5
20956,Got bright pink ones that hurt my eyes in the tanning bed. Not worth it.,1
20957,Thought they'd be smaller.  But came in a day early ^.^,4
20958,"It arrived on time, love the brush is super soft!",4
20959,I used it for about a week then it broke very disappointing,1
20960,I wanted something that was akin to organic and this was it.  It's fine.,4
20961,"I loved it but sadly,.... It fell off one day and I lost it D: Good buy for the price though.",4
20962,Very handy for moving pizzas from pan to plate. I also used it to reheat slices of pizza in the oven.,4
20963,These got here sooner then I thought they would but right as I opened it from the package the white pearl fell off. Very disappointing.,2
20964,it is a good everyday brush. nothing fancy but definitely sturdy,4
20965,It works great but it bothers me that it doesnt have a plastic seal when you open it.,4
20966,This is a great product I just don't know if its worth buying online. Product is fine.,3
20967,"Has suction, but not for long, motor's weak. My niece plays with it when she's over.",3
20968,Used specifically for my beard. Works great and easy to clean off wax/balm build up from daily usage. Letter rubbed off within a few washes.,4
20969,Great to go organic but these socks shrink and become hard to pull on.,3
20970,Did not notice any difference.  The smell is so strong that I have hd a headache since yesterday.  don't waste your money like I did.,1
20971,Very good razor. The closest shave ever. power mode does soothe a bit. Overall gr8 product.,4
20972,Smells strongly of vitamins and the boost of B12 actually made me feel like drinking more. Same old hangover next day and very dehydrated.,1
20973,Goes on very smooth and is very useful to do lip gradients and work with lip stain.,4
20974,It's got a good stream and great features but it leaks a little.,3
20975,"Since I found this talc, things have been cooler and drier! It has a nice scent and is long lasting.",5
20976,"it gave me wood

<script>

Let me take you in the",4
20977,"This works well,  It's wooden and you put shaving soap in it.  Thats pretty much what its for and thats what it does.  Decent quality",4
20978,It is o.k. but I expected it to work better with curly hair.,3
20979,Worked decent.  Minor changes.  Make sure to start with the lower percentage solution.  Some might have sensitive teeth.,3
20980,Was kinda disappointed I thought they were bigger ... But it's okay,3
20981,This product wasn't clear in the description and had to be returned. The seller needs to do a better job of describing the product.,1
20982,Everything in this kit is great!  But the ball gag pinches and is really hard.  Other than that I love this kit!,4
20983,"Shaves well cleans easily recharges quickly. I would buy this again. Comfortable shave, lightweight and easy to handle. Great purchase!",5
20984,Very effective. Just extremely loud. Not for someone with roommates.,4
20985,"I have these in black and white. They are very pretty, just a little heavy",4
20986,"Like it, but a bit messy. Nature of a water pressure device.",4
20987,"Works nicely, and dried great under UV light. Not thick at all but sticky if you use to much.
Multiple compliments on nails.",4
20988,A little bit heavier than I expected.  Thought it was nicely made. Very comfortable  . All in all a good product.,5
20989,"Doesn't  generate enough lather to suit me, but has fair lubrication. Nothing to write home about, Three stars at best.",3
20990,Like the toliet room holder. Thought I was getting brushed nickel.,3
20991,Turns out not to have any apricot oil in it at all! Does work nicely but I was looking for apricot oil.,3
20992,Kinda hard to use the instructions suck but once you figure it out it looks nice just complicated need better explanation,3
20993,The product arrived in plenty of time for the holidays and the gift was well received! I recommend this product to everyone.,5
20994,It's terrible. Pulls your hair. I got it because the reviews..so I'm very unhappy,1
20995,Does the job but is a little messy because it's hard to keep the pic in your mouth the whole time.,3
20996,"Love this trimmer. I had it for 10 years before i bought it again, better then other ones i've tried",5
20997,"I didn't have a break out when using this the first time, and I'll update my review once I've used it more!",4
20998,my favorite exfoliator; the travel size will last you a good amount of time!,5
20999,Helps out with perspiration in between the legs...  A must have when playing sports in warmer climates!,5
21000,I enjoy using this brush.  It was just what I wanted.,4
21001,This works OK. It would have worked better if it was not so flat headed and had some tooth.,3
21002,"It's smaller than I thought it would be, but it's pretty. I get compliments every time I wear it.",4
21003,Pretty much no heat from this thing. Would not get another Helen of Troy product if this is a fair example of their merchandise.,2
21004,Worked very well. Love all of the attachments. I also like the variable pressure spray dial. I will use this alot.,4
21005,Great for removing make-up. I have all skin products by Algenist.,5
21006,"I LOVE CREST 3D BETTER, JUST SAYING, THE TASTE IS JUST NOT FOR ME  BUT MY BOYFRIEND SEEMS TO LIKE IT.",5
21007,It's hard to tell if this is working but I am willing to give it a try.  No adverse reaction to it and it dries quickly.,4
21008,"This product is great for braces
The only problem with this product is that the button to release pik is very sensitive",4
